      <title>'It's the book that gave me freedom': Michael Ondaatje on The English Patient</title>
      <subtitle>The novel has been translated into 38 languages and the film scooped nine Oscars. Now, as The English Patient wins the Golden Booker prize - voted readers' favourite in 50 years - the author reveals why he could never have been a writer if he'd stayed in Britain</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>On Sunday night, Michael Ondaatje stepped on to the wide stage of the Royal Festival Hall in London. He found a lectern and, white head bowed, reached into his pocket for a small piece of paper. "It began with a small night conversation between a burned patient and a nurse," he said. "I did not know at first where it was taking place, or who the two characters were. I thought it might be a brief novella - all dialogue, European-style, big type."</p>
      <p>The audience laughed. Because what actually turned up, of course, was The English Patient : 300-plus pages about four people inhabiting the mined rooms of a remote Italian villa at the end of the second world war; four very different people who meet in damaged solitude, who talk (there are a lot of night conversations), who love, whose histories, revealed in vivid flashes, become a taut, outraged meditation on the idea of war, of nationalism and of prejudice; a meditation that slips between spies and explorers, Suffolk and the Egyptian desert; the Punjab and Women's College Hospital, Toronto, as easily as the sapper, Kip, slips into bomb craters to defuse bombs.</p>
      <p>The English Patient shared the Booker prize with Barry Unsworth 's Sacred Hunger in 1992, has been translated into 38 languages, and in 1996 became an Anthony Minghella-directed film winning nine Academy awards, and grossing $231m worldwide to date. By Sunday night it had been shortlisted for the Golden Man Booker 50: the best Booker winners of the last 50 years, arrived at by decade. Ondaatje's competition was VS Naipaul, for In a Free State (1970s), Penelope Lively's Moon Tiger (80s), Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall (2000s), and George Saunders' Lincoln in the Bardo (10s). And, after a public vote, The English Patient won.</p>
      <p>Upstairs, in a room with long views of a Thames blurry with heat, Ondaatje accepts congratulations and a glass of "white wine, please. My first in months." He has one of the most recognisable faces in literature: pale eyes sharp in a wide, tanned face, a halo of white hair and beard. He is gracious, quick and thoughtful, but also well-defended, steely and distracted; aware of friends waiting to celebrate with him downstairs, he talks faster and faster, and eventually simply stops.</p>
      <p>I had been teaching for years. I thought I was going to lose it - and I had quit my job. I just had to finish the book. It was a bet</p>
      <p>What an extraordinary afterlife the book has had. "Well, it already had a second afterlife with the film, right? And that was a bolt of lightning that I wasn't expecting. And then this - suddenly redoing the whole thing again. Another horse race, you know?" He laughs. Though both were a fillip, really, on what the first prize gave him, which was the most precious thing: "Freedom. I had been teaching for many, many years up to that point." Teaching full-time, in fact, and "trying to write a complicated novel", and that had become too much to manage. "I thought I was going to lose it - and I had quit my job. I just needed to finish the book. It was a bet." Which could not have come off more handsomely.</p>
      <p>Penelope Lively, in her speech earlier in the evening, had mused about how different a person she was, at 85, from the one who in her mid-50s had written Moon Tiger. What did Ondaatje think of the self who wrote The English Patient (which he has not reread since it was published)? "Well, I still like him." More interesting, he thinks, is the way in which each book he's written is like "a time capsule".</p>
      <p>When he was writing The English Patient, between about 1985 and 1992, there was an argument going on in Canada about nationalism and integration. "They didn't want Sikhs to wear turbans if they were policemen and stuff like that. That was in the air." The striking thing is how contemporary his concerns - how to release oneself from the imposition of nationalism; how to rediscover one's essential individuality or true, often artistic allegiances - now feel. Contemporary, and somehow, in a harsher time, impossibly idealistic.</p>
      <p>Ondaatje is fond of a quotation from John Berger : "Never again will a story be told as if it were the only one." It is a moral imperative, isn't it? Especially in current western politics, which seems so determined to cancel the multiplicity of viewpoints from all over the world, or at least to pretend that they don't exist. "Oh, absolutely. The Berger quote is very interesting because it's a political statement, but it's also an artistic statement."</p>
      <p>So wasn't the ending of The English Patient, in which the Sikh Kip (whose relationship with the Canadian nurse, Hana, Ondaatje describes as being like "continents meeting") drops everything and returns home when he hears of the bombs falling on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a failure of nerve? A reimposition of the nationalisms dissolved through the rest of the novel, where, as Kamila Shamsie put it: "Ondaatje's imagination acknowledges no borders"?</p>
      <p>"They can't overcome," says Ondaatje, who remembers that he found the last pages of The English Patient sad to write. It is too difficult for most people; and for Kip, especially, who in the nuclear glare sees suddenly that "they would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation".</p>
      <p>In Warlight, published only last month, Ondaatje refers to a subplot of greyhound smuggling up the Thames as "a vast mongrelisation" of pedigree dogs; it could equally apply to the kitchens of the Criterion, in Piccadilly, where his teenage character Nathaniel finds himself working; to London restaurant kitchens today; to Ondaatje's ideal of the world - and to Ondaatje, too. Born in what was then Ceylon, he is of Dutch-Tamil-Sinhalese descent. His parents, tea planters, separated when he was about seven, when his mother moved to England; he would, decades later, in Running in the Family describe in both funny and heartbreaking prose his father's eventual lonely death from alcoholism.</p>
      <p>He was cared for by his chaotic, dramatic, but loving extended family, then aged 11 sent, alone, on the three-week boat voyage to England. It was only when his grown children were appalled by it that he realised it might be unusual, and a good story (it became the scaffolding for 2011's The Cat's Table, about a boy called Michael, to whom the same thing happens). He went to Dulwich College in London, where Ondaatje was nicknamed Kip - a reference to kipper grease.</p>
      <p>He has just given a talk at Dulwich, in fact, about Warlight "and I saw three or four people I hadn't seen since I was a teenager. Suddenly I'm getting emails to 'Kip' all the time. That's how they remember me." In The English Patient, Kip is perfectly happy with his nickname, until the nuclear bombs fall, when all at once he realises: "His name is Kirpal Singh, and he does not know what he is doing here."</p>
      <p>Did acquiring a British moniker ever make Ondaatje feel similarly alienated? "Yeah - well, it is strange." But he doesn't remember the name affecting him ("it didn't feel insulting") and although he has previously said how much he disliked England, he is more mellow about it now. "I went through school with a lot of irony. I just realised that this is ... a different place, with a different set of rules, and values, and tastes. Not that it's bad, but I had to adapt to it - and it happened fast."</p>
      <p>In Running in the Family he describes his impetus for memoir as a feeling that he had "slipped past a childhood I had ignored and not understood". Is that what he's been doing in his fiction, too - trying to understand his childhood? "Yeah - and I think that's probably true in pretty much most of the books, I think. Perhaps. I think it's possible, in retrospect. I think maybe I've done it now. I'll leave childhood alone."</p>
      <p>Anthony Minghella is no longer with us but I suspect he has something to do with the result of this vote</p>
      <p>He eventually found his own freedom by leaving again - for Canada, where his brother Christopher already lived, and university. (Christopher, also, is a writer - and a hugely successful businessman, a philanthropist and a bobsledding Olympian.) I wonder if it was easier to write from there. His reply is instant. "I don't think I would ever have been able to write if I lived in England. Because there was a mythology. In the 50s, to say you were a poet - John Keats was a poet, or Shakespeare was a poet - it had a lot of gall. Ted Hughes and all those guys hadn't even emerged yet. That happened 10 years after I left."</p>
      <p>In Canada he met young writers, was published by small presses unfazed by novels that read like poems, and vice versa. He taught, he became an editor himself - at the literary magazine Brick, from which he only stepped down a year ago, after 30 years. And now he has returned, to be crowned by the British reading public the best of the Booker 50. In his thank you he listed novels that missed out on the Booker but that he thought should get a mention - by JL Carr, William Trevor, Barbara Pym, Alice Munro and Samuel Selvon. He thanked "small presses everywhere", and Minghella, "who is no longer with us but I suspect has something to do with the result of this vote". There's a knowingness in the laugh he gets from the audience this time, too.</p>

      <p>I ADMIRED as a tour de force Aleksandr Sokurov's Russian Ark , his history of Russia shot in an unbroken 95-minute take in the Hermitage. His other films I find murky and unnecessarily obscure.</p>
      <p>Father and Son is the second part of a trilogy begun in 1996 with the much-vaunted Mother and Son , a mixture of Tarkovsky and late Beckett that struck me as achingly tedious. This new film is a little more vigorous and concentrates on the troubled relationship between an 18-year-old Russian soldier and his 38-year-old father, a widowed ex-serviceman dying of lung cancer.</p>
      <p>They're a competitive pair, playing football on the roof of their dilapidated block of flats and frolicking danger ously on wooden boards linking high windows, and there is a further crisis provoked by the appearance of the orphaned son of a former comrade-in-arms of the father. The language is gnomic and the picture has a woozy, dreamlike quality. Some of the latter is due to the fact that the anonymous Russian city in which it is set is a combination of Leningrad studio sets and Lisbon locations.</p>
      <p>Three new French films this week, one good, one so-so, one appalling. The good movie is Fear and Trembling , written and directed by the unpredictable Alain Corneau and based on an autobiographical novel by the Belgian author Amelie Nothomb. Sylvie Testud plays Amelie, a Belgian girl who was born in Japan and spent her first five years there. She loves the country and, after studying the language, returns there in the 1990s with a year's contract as a translator for a conglomerate in Tokyo. What follows is not the idyll she expects but a succession of painful misunderstandings between a liberal Westerner and her superiors and colleagues, the products of a patriarchal, hierarchical society.</p>
      <p>Except for a few shots in a Zen garden and the streets of Tokyo, Fear and Trembling never leaves the office block, and the dialogue is all in Japanese with a French voiceover. The film is initially an amusing comedy of international manners. Thereafter, it takes on an increasingly dark tone when a sadistic confrontation develops between Amelie and her beautiful 29-year-old boss, a relationship she compares to that between the camp commandant and the PoW played by David Bowie in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence . The depiction of life in Japan is both frank and illuminating, and it can be seen as a companion piece to the lightweight Lost in Translation</p>
      <p>The so-so French picture, Yann Samuel's Love Me If You Dare , also moves from light comedy to something disturbing and black. It's the story of Julien and Sophie who, at the age of eight, embark on what is to be a lifelong folie a deux in which each must accept the dare proposed by the other. Their school pranks lead eventually to homicide. They're as crazy as Cocteau's enfants terribles or any couple in an early Godard film. The movie is highly stylised and edgily erotic and as the grown-up Julien and Sophie, Guillaume Canet and Marion Cottillard are the quintessence of a certain kind of arrogant intellectual chic.</p>
      <p>Andrew Litvack, an American subtitler of French movies and protege of Ismael Merchant and James Ivory, makes an inauspicious debut with Merci Docteur Rey , a dismal comedy starring Dianne Wiest as an American diva in Paris, performing in Turandot and trying to keep her gay ex-husband (Simon Callow) away from their layabout son, who, unknown to her, is a closet gay.</p>
      <p>The farcical plot features a murder, the sudden death of a shrink during analysis, Jane Birkin as an actress who thinks she's Vanessa Redgrave, a brief appearance by the real Vanessa Redgrave, two thick flics and a meaningless cameo by Jerry Hall. The underdirected actors are ill at ease with a witless script.</p>
      <p>Merci Docteur Rey is so bad that it makes this week's American high-school movie, A Cinderella Story , look like Feydeau. This is a by-numbers comedy executed by a semi-numerate, transposing the Cinderella story to a San Fernando Valley high school with the usual dramatis personae.</p>
      <p>Cinders (Hilary Duff) is the put-upon stepdaughter of the wicked Fiona, a Botox broad who makes her slave in the family's diner and intercepts her letter of acceptance from Princeton. The neatest touch is to replace the glass slipper with a cell- phone and there is the occasional serviceable line such as the one in which the stepmother thinks Norwegian salmon comes from Norwe gia. The movie takes its romance between the heroine and her footballer Prince Charming far too seriously.</p>
      <p>Soul Plane is a staggeringly unfunny black (ie, African-American) comedy that begins with a man from South Central being awarded $ 100 million damages after his bottom gets stuck in an aeroplane's lavatory and his pet dog is jettisoned at 30,000 feet. He invests the money in his own funky airline designed to meet the dreams of the brothers and sisters and to scare whitey out of his wits.</p>
      <p>This is the first feature film by Jessy Terrero, a prolific director of videos, one of them called Wanksta , and the script is by Bo Zenga, who gave up banking for the cinema and produced the leaden Scary Movie</p>
      <p>Back in distribution, and highly welcome, is Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine (1995), an example of the French genre dubbed le film de banlieu , ie, pictures set in run-down French suburbs, in this case a depressing, multi-ethnic blue-collar district on the outskirts of Paris.</p>
      <p>It follows the drifting, desperate lives of three friends over 24 hours from dusk to dawn - a handsome black boxer, a mercurial, streetwise Algerian and a volatile working-class Jew (Vincent Cassel putting himself firmly on the map). Shot in harsh black and white, the film has a documentary feel, but the sharp, often bizarre detail raises it above the mere slice of life.</p>

      <title>Committed to change: Working in partnership: United we stand: Despite a lack of official support and funding, people across the world have found that working together in partnership can be hugely effective in the fight against HIV/Aids. Here are just three examples</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Kenya</p>
      <p>On the toilet wall of a small hotel close to the Dunga Beach resort on Lake Victoria is a poster of a powerfully built, smiling man showing off his magnificent biceps. Above the man's head are the words: "I wanted to . . . she didn't." Beneath his torso is the caption: "And so . . . we didn't."</p>
      <p>The picture is arresting, not only for the man's sheer vitality and beauty, but because of its location. The hotel is frequented from time to time by local fishermen and their jaboya - a Luo word for a customer who is also a lover. Women fishmongers regularly buy fish from specific fishermen and in return give sexual favours to guarantee a regular supply of fish.</p>
      <p>The poster, and several others advocating safer sex, have been placed in as many public places as possible by the organisation MMAAK - the Movement of Men Against Aids in Kenya. Since 2001, MMAAK has concentrated on equipping men to play a more prominent role in Africa's response to HIV prevention. One of their main partnerships is with fisherfolk living along the shores of Lake Victoria.</p>
      <p>Henry Osalu and around 20 other fishermen meet regularly with MMAAK in a small shack close to Dunga Beach's bustling fish-processing market. Henry has been a fisherman since the late 1960s, when the supply of Nile perch and tilapia was plentiful.</p>
      <p>"The practice of jaboya started when the lake fell into poor health. Now when fishermen come to shore, you can see the women fighting over the catch. If a woman's children are going hungry, and having sex with these men is the only way of giving her an income, it's unlikely she will say no."</p>
      <p>Michael Onyanga, MMAAK's national director, says many fishermen have the virus but believe they should suffer in silence to protect their masculinity. "In Kenya, traditionally, men are not empowered or given skills to deal with sex and sexuality. Yet they make most of the decisions at home, in the workplace, in parliament and in religious institutions."</p>
      <p>He feels that the fishing fraternity has been overlooked. "Men are hard to reach. Many assume they are not affected. Few belong to organised groups. So the workplace becomes one obvious alternative."</p>
      <p>Charles Juma is another fisherman based at Dunga Beach. He says that it takes time and determination to change behaviours. "Free testing, counselling and distribution of anti-retroviral treament won't do much good if they're scheduled when men are out fishing or have moved on. The nomadic lifestyle of men here has to be considered if the project is going to make an impact."</p>
      <p>Nick Were from MMAAK says that he regularly talks to fishermen who feel that the more sexual partners he has, the more masculine he will be. "Fishing is by its nature quite isolating. They sometimes spend months away from their wives and children. What we are trying to do is encourage these men to take HIV tests, to use condoms, to communicate and be open about HIV. Positive men can feel emasculated. They do not want to disclose to their wives. They fear discrimination and stigma at work. We are trying to overcome that."</p>
      <p>Were says MMAAK's poster of the man respecting his partner's wishes not to have sex is an attempt to show that a man can still exercise his masculinity and sexual prowess by showing restraint and being gentle.</p>
      <p>"By building partnerships, by rejecting the idea that all men are intrinsically bad, oppressive and promiscuous, we find we are able to involve more people in the fight against HIV/Aids."</p>
      <p>India</p>
      <p>The screech of breaking trains occasionally drowns out the story of how HK Mukadar came to live on platform one of Bubaneswar railway station. Sitting beside the tracks, the 17-year-old describes how he has bounced from Bombay to Calcutta and finally Bubaneswar in Orissa province. Since he was orphaned as a toddler, he has survived by working as a tea boy, as a servant and now by selling empty plastic bottles. During that time he has had sex: with adults entrusted with his care, with his employers for money, with sex workers and with the boys and girls who, like him, also sleep on the station platform.</p>
      <p>Eight months ago he began to confide in the volunteers from Ruchika Social Service Organisation, a local NGO supported by Concern Worldwide, who run a recreation centre on the platform five days a week. Most have no family ties in the city and are abandoned or orphaned. Some of them spend their days travelling on the trains and sleep rough in bus shelters, dark alleys, building sites and behind cardboard boxes. They are vulnerable to sexual encounters with their peers, homeless adults or those in authority.</p>
      <p>Ruchika workers talk to the teenagers about sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV and how to prevent their transmission. In two years, the project entitled Operation Healthy Platform has helped almost 1,000 adolescent street children access state health services.</p>
      <p>Mukadar is one of them. He told Ruchika volunteers he was experiencing pain and itching and they took him to hospital where he was tested for STIs and HIV. "Before, I didn't know what HIV was. I didn't know you could get infections from sex," he says. He tested negative for the virus and has been treated for STIs.</p>
      <p>Ruchika also targets other members of the community who have a stake in the health of the street children, including stall owners, petty vendors, rickshaw pullers, police and station porters. Some of them have sex with the adolescents as they too sleep rough on the platform.</p>
      <p>Mukadar is one of dozens of peer educators the organisation has trained to talk to other street adolescents about how to have safer sex. "I identify if anyone has an STI and take them to hospital," he says. "I talk to them about how to use condoms and where to buy them. I talk to them about sex and sexuality."</p>
      <p>He says he now uses condoms and has other things on his mind apart from sex. "I'm in love with a girl. She lives on the platform and loves me too. I like her so much I want to marry her. I want to get off the platform and have my own stall selling fruit."</p>
      <p>Zambia</p>
      <p>Over 35% of households believe that being HIV positive "should be kept a secret" and just over a quarter think that people living with HIV/Aids "should be ashamed of themselves", according to a recent national sexual behaviour survey in Zambia.</p>
      <p>With such widespread attitudes - which lead to people with HIV/Aids facing acts of discrimination and abuse - it's no wonder that a few of them decided to form a group to challenge the misconceptions that continue to be branded about.</p>
      <p>Originally formed in 2003, the Network of Zambian People living with HIV/Aids (NZP+) in the Mongu district of western Zambia has now grown to seven support groups, with over 230 members. They provide psychosocial support to HIV positive members, their families and local communities, as well as providing information on positive living. In addition, they help people to access anti-retroviral therapy (ART) services and work with other partners to provide loans and grants to support income-generating activities like chicken rearing and vegetable gardens.</p>
      <p>The biggest challenge for the Kuomboka support group - all of whom are HIV positive - is that most of them are poor, explain the 59 members, who all sit on the floor of a small hut, where they meet weekly. "Many of the breadwinners are sick or have died," says one woman.</p>
      <p>Poor women - who form the vast majority of the group in Kuomboka - face particular vulnerability when they have the virus. They have fewer vocational skills to fall back on in times of hardship and they fear for the future for their children.</p>
      <p>With many more women infected with HIV compared to men, significant numbers - including many of the Kuomboka group - find themselves on the street, thrown out when they are tested for HIV. When they return to their original families, they are not necessarily welcomed. "When I went back to my family, they wouldn't eat what I had prepared," remarks one.</p>
      <p>They all describe the support group as invaluable. "We feel like we are a big family," says one. "We help each other in so many different ways and so it's not just about feeling less isolated, but also a means of survival and teaching our younger members useful skills," says another.</p>
      <p>Their poultry-keeping programme, for example, involves each of the members taking it in turns to carry out duties such as clearing the pens and collecting the eggs. They market and sell the eggs, and benefit from the income raised. The fact that it makes people so productive helps reduce the stigma of HIV, adds one member.</p>

      <p>* De Montfort University</p>
      <p>The De Montfort of today has emerged from the unification of a wide range of specialist institutions and has an impressive way of re-inventing itself. Most recently this has meant allowing the Bedford campus to merge with the University of Luton to create the new University of Bedfordshire, and there's a constant programme of investment and development. Which leaves De Montfort as a dynamic, forward-thinking and sizeable university. The main campus is in Leicester's city centre, with a second - the Charles Frear campus, offering courses in nursing and midwifery - on the outskirts. Leicester is England's 10th largest city, with good transport links and all the facilities you'd expect. It's also brilliantly multicultural - the Diwali celebrations are something to be seen.</p>
      <p>Fees</p>
      <p>£3,070 for full time undergraduate courses in 2007.</p>
      <p>Bursaries</p>

      <p>* Derby University</p>
      <p>Flexibility is something of a watchword at Derby. It invites you to create your own degree, study part-time or choose a fast-track degree. It also emphasises its vocational slant - links with employers and other partners are carefully maintained. Not surprisingly, Derby attracts large numbers of mature students and people from non-traditional backgrounds. Derby is a pleasant, historical city and Buxton, location of the university's second campus, is an equally charming spa town. Both are handy for some lovely countryside and easygoing enough to make you feel right at home.</p>
      <p>Fees</p>
      <p>£3,070 for all full-time undergradate courses in 2007.</p>
      <p>Bursaries</p>
      <p>£800 for students eligible for the full government maintenance grant and then on a sliding scale for those eligible for a partial grant, down to £200. Further awards for local students are also available.</p>
      <p>Accommodation</p>
      <p>Guaranteed for first-years, in one of seven halls of residence. The halls are all close to the campuses and you can opt to live in them for a second year, if you prefer.</p>

      <p>* University of Dundee</p>
      <p>Thanks to its south-facing position, Dundee has claims to be the sunniest city in Scotland. It also might be the silliest, if the pages of its most famous exports - The Beano and The Dandy, published by local firm DC Thompson &amp; Co - are anything to go by. It's also large enough to be interesting (and the most densely populated bit of Scotland after Glasgow) but compact enough to be friendly and manageable. And it's close to Edinburgh if you have a surplus of cultural requirements, and also nice countryside and coast if you have a surplus of physical energy to expend by doing outdoorsy things. The university has recently invested £200m in campus improvements, including £39m for new student accommodation. Expect your digs to be pretty fancy, then.</p>
      <p>Fees</p>
      <p>Currently, Scottish students pay no fees but pay a graduate endowment of £2,000 upon graduation. Other students are liable for £1,700 fees (£2,700 for degrees in medicine).</p>
      <p>Bursaries</p>
      <p>Young students' bursaries available from SAAS for Scottish students under 25 from low-income families. Students applying for and going on to study one of the three-year honours degree programmes can apply for the chancellor's scholarship of £1,000 a year for three years. Additional academic, musical and sporting bursaries available.</p>
      <p>Accommodation</p>
      <p>Guaranteed for applications received by July of the year of entry. New accommodation has recently been opened and there are four residence sites in total. Prices range from £68 to £93.</p>

      <p>* Durham University</p>
      <p>Lovely Durham is home to one of the country's top universities. The city is picturesque, wooded, hilly and aching with heritage. The brooding Norman cathedral dominates the skyline - and it tells you something about the prestige of the university that one of its colleges is housed in the castle right next door. Durham is a collegiate university, meaning that student life has a real sense of focus and community to it. There's also more than a whiff of Oxbridge to proceedings - fun, if you like that sort of thing. If you don't, you'll probably be relieved to know that Durham has put its money where its mouth is when it comes to widening participation. Its Queen's campus in nearby Stockton-on-Tees boasts plenty of local and mature students. Durham students are well placed for glorious countryside and coastline and there are good transport links - especially rail, since you're on the fast east-coast line here - should you want to leave. Though why would you?</p>
      <p>Fees</p>
      <p>£3,070 a year for all full-time undergraduate courses in 2008-09.</p>
      <p>Bursaries</p>

      <p>* University of Exeter</p>
      <p>One of the lesser-known recipes for happiness is to live somewhere that other people pay to go to on holiday. Students at Exeter are likely to have permanent smiles on their faces: it has campuses in the cathedral city and also near Falmouth, in Cornwall, as well as plenty of coastline, countryside and glorious weather. Add to that the fact that the Streatham campus is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful in the country and that Exeter is rated one of the best universities in the UK for "ents", and it's no wonder that increases in applications far exceed the national average. Of course, you'll have to do some work, too - Exeter has an excellent academic reputation.</p>
      <p>Fees</p>

      <title>Weekend: THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF DR GLOCK: When an American archaeologist was shot dead by a masked gunman on the West Bank in 1992, both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict came under suspicion. Was it the Palestinians trying to halt the peace process then in progress, or was it the Israelis, incensed by his potentially explosive archaeological findings? Then again, it might just have been the tragic result of a squabble between colleagues . . .</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Not many people will have read it, apart from addicts of the history and politics of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but in the spring 1994 issue of an American academic journal called the Journal Of Palestine Studies, there appeared an article entitled Archaeology As Cultural Survival: The Future Of The Palestinian Past. Its author was a little-known American archaeologist, Dr Albert E Glock, who was identified as the director of the Institute of Palestinian Archaeology at Birzeit University, the main Palestinian university in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>Glock's article argued that the Palestinian people had been ill-served by the archaeology carried out in their country since excavations began there in the middle of the 19th century. Since their country was also the land in which the stories of the Bible are set, Glock wrote, archaeologists have been exclusively interested in digging up material evidence of the biblical era, to the exclusion of all other periods, notably the centuries of Islamic rule that are of much greater interest to the Arab population. The archaeology of the Holy Land, argued Glock, has written the Palestinians out of the history of their own country in favour of a history of ancient Israel - the latter being, of course, of greater interest to Christians and to the people of modern Israel.</p>
      <p>Glock, a one-time Lutheran minister from Illinois , had begun his archaeological career in the region with the excavations at Tell Ta'anach, a biblical site in the northern West Bank, but in the course of a 20-year personal odyssey in the Holy Land he had since transformed himself from a traditional biblical archaeologist into an advocate of an alternative archaeology of the Holy Land; one that sought to redress this imbalance in favour of an archaeology of the Palestinians. His article was a forceful contribution to the cultural politics of the Israel-Palestine conflict from the Palestinian side; but it was unusual in that it placed a subject one would have thought non-political right at the heart of the conflict. Glock was convinced that the struggle for the history of Palestine as revealed by archaeology lay at the heart of the struggle between the two peoples.</p>
      <p>Attached to the first page of the article was an extraordinary biographical footnote. It read:</p>
      <p>Albert Glock, an American archaeologist and educator who was killed by an unidentified gunman in Birzeit, the West Bank, on 19 January 1992, wrote this essay in 1990 . . . Dr Glock had spent 17 years in Jerusalem and the West Bank, first as director of the Albright Institute for Archaeology and then as head of the archaeology department of Birzeit University, where he helped found the Archaeology Institute. A brief review of the facts connected with his unsolved murder is in order. Dr Glock was shot three times at close range (twice in the back of the head and neck, and once in the heart from the front) by a masked man using an Israeli army gun who was driven away in a car with Israeli licence plates. It took the Israeli authorities, who were nearby, three hours to get to the scene. Apart from a 10-minute statement, Dr Glock's widow was never asked about his activities, entries in his diary, possible enemies, and so on. The lack of Israeli investigation into the murder of an American citizen is perhaps the most unusual feature of the case . . . Prospects for solving the case thus appear remote.</p>
      <p>The way the footnote was written - in a tone of muted outrage - suggested that Glock had been killed by some sort of Israeli hit squad (the gun, the licence plates, the lack of investigation). But why would an Israeli hit squad want to kill an archaeologist? Why would an Israeli hit squad want to kill an American archaeologist, even one with obvious Palestinian sympathies? Why would anyone want to kill an archaeologist?</p>
      <p>On the day he was murdered, Glock was working in his office in the Institute of Archaeology. It was a Sunday, and that morning he had attended divine service at the Church of the Redeemer in the Old City of Jerusalem, one of the number of religious institutions clustered tightly around the Holy Sepulchre, the lugubrious and claustrophobic Christian shrine that is traditionally believed to contain the tomb of Jesus Christ and the site of his crucifixion.</p>
      <p>He drove his VW van from near the Damascus Gate northwards, through Ramallah, to his office in the village of Birzeit, a 30-minute journey. Glock worked alone that day. The shelves in his workroom were filled from floor to ceiling with the cardboard boxes, neatly marked, that contained the excavation material from his digs. The work tables in the room were covered with hundreds of blackened shards of burnt pottery, arranged in a state somewhere between order and chaos. Glock was working with his teaching assistant and a staff technician on the painstaking business of putting as many of the fragments as possible back together into their original forms as domestic pottery vessels.</p>
      <p>Some time before 3pm, Glock closed up the office and turned the key in the VW. It was his plan to stop off briefly at the teaching assistant's house in the village to leave a message. The house was built on a slope, below the level of the road. He parked, and walked down the concrete ramp to the front door. As Glock walked towards the front door, a young man with his face wrapped in a kaffiyeh, a black-and-white checked cotton scarf, and dressed in a dark jacket, jeans and white trainers, silently jumped down from the stone wall built against the edge of the road. When he was about a metre away, he shot Glock three times. One of the family inside the house looked out the window just in time to see a figure disappear into a waiting car.</p>
      <p>Glock was murdered at 3.15pm on a rainy afternoon, a bleak, cold day in a winter that had been one of the coldest anyone in the West Bank could remember. There had been heavy snow, which stayed frozen on the ground for days. The snow brought down telephone lines and power cables, cutting off electricity and telephones, and the ice caused water pipes to burst. That month, January 1992, was the beginning of the fifth year of the intifada, the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. By early 1992, the intifada was long past its peak, its leaders were languishing in Israeli jails, and the original idealism and hopes of the uprising had given way to a darker, more violent phase that Palestinians called "the red intifada".</p>
      <p>It was a grim and dangerous time to be living in the West Bank, but Albert Glock had lived there too long to think about leaving, even though he was 67 years old and overdue for retirement. A year earlier, during the Gulf war, he and his wife Lois had stayed on in the West Bank while most other resident foreigners had fled to safer places. His aim was to be accepted in Palestinian society: he didn't think it was right to leave when the going got tough. The Palestinians, after all (he wrote in letters to friends), could not leave when it would have been more comfortable for them to do so. Glock was a stubborn, rock-ribbed Midwestern Lutheran. He wasn't going to be frightened away from his life's work, the archaeology of Palestine, either by the rocks of the Palestinians or the bullets of the Israelis.</p>
      <p>His killing made it into the following day's Jerusalem Post. The story included speculation about who might have been responsible. "Palestinian sources," the paper reported, "said last night they suspected Glock was slain by Hamas terrorists trying to stop the peace process." The Israel-Arab peace talks, which would end in the Oslo agreement in September 1993, were underway in Washington, and the Islamic party Hamas had declared its opposition to the negotiations, which it considered capitulation to the Israeli enemy.</p>
      <p>The Jerusalem Post went into more detail in the story it published the next day, which widened the field of suspicion, but still set it squarely on the Palestinian side: "Two motives for the crime are being discussed around campus. The first, say Arab sources, is that Glock was killed either by Hamas or Popular Front (for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO) activists in order to disrupt the peace process. They also link the timing of this killing to the fact that he was a US citizen and this is the anniversary of the Gulf war. The second version is that the murder was part of a power struggle among the archaeology faculty, one of whom was fired recently. Birzeit president Gabi Baramki denies this emphatically."</p>
      <p>Among the Palestinians themselves, however, a rumour began to spread that, at the time of his death, Albert Glock was working on an archaeological excavation near Nablus, and that he had made a discovery that would undermine the whole Israeli historic claim to Jerusalem. So the Israelis killed him to prevent him from revealing his discovery. The story is garbled: Glock never excavated near Nablus. But a similar suspicion was expressed in a statement broadcast by the PLO on its Algiers radio station, Voice Of Palestine. This statement set the murder in the front line of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and made the simple, obvious equation that Glock was the victim of a political assassination because of the political potency of his archaeological work, and that Israel was responsible for it.</p>
      <p>Glock first came to Palestine in 1962, to excavate Tell Ta'anach, an ancient mound in the northern West Bank near Jenin. Ta'anach was one of the Canaanite city states that, the Bible relates, were conquered by the Israelite commander Joshua. With a group of biblical archaeologists from a Lutheran seminary in Illinois, Glock excavated for three seasons before and after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. But later, after he began to teach at Birzeit, Glock took the radical step of returning to Ta'anach, or rather the Palestinian village at the base of the tell called Ti'innik, to excavate not the parts of the site that related to biblical history but the more recent remains of the 400 years of Ottoman rule in Palestine, which ended in 1918. His aim was to discover not the glories of the Bible but the more modest story of how ordinary life was lived at this ancient site, which had been occupied, on and off, for 5,000 years. The villagers thought it strange that Glock and his team were not interested in excavating the mound, as previous archaeologists had done, but in digging up the sardine cans in their garbage dumps. They thought the archaeologists must be Israelis.</p>
      <p>The rumour about Glock discovering something near Nablus therefore had some vague connection to the truth: like Ti'innik, Nablus is in the northern West Bank, and Glock had indeed been excavating something that related to the history of the Palestinians in Palestine, and which had nothing to do with the modern Israelis or the ancient Israelites. Glock was opposed to the view, held by rightwing Israelis, that the biblical accounts of God's promise of the land of Palestine to the Israelites, and their later conquest by Joshua, are not only historically true but a justification of the conquest and seizure of the land of Palestine by their contemporary successors, modern Israelis. Simple rationalism argues against it, he believed. Yet a view of the history of Palestine that does not take the Bible literally is necessarily political: in dissenting from traditional biblical history, Glock was opposing the Zionist project of laying claim to Palestine, and using the biblical tradition to legitimise it. And then he was shot.</p>
      <p>Each side believed that the other was guilty of Glock's murder, perhaps not least because, in the never-ending Israel-Palestine conflict, it had become a habit of thought to blame the other side automatically for anything that went wrong. But the killing of Albert Glock was veiled in ambiguity. As every police reporter knows, most murders are personal, and are committed by someone known to the victim. Most murders take place within the family - infanticide is the most common form of murder - and most murders are therefore easy to solve. Glock's killing, however, was not at all like this, so it was evidently an assassination: the killing of someone for what they stand for, by someone the victim did not know personally. Political killings are common enough in the land of the Bible, and they are usually easy to interpret. Yigal Amir, the young man who killed prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, for example, had an intelligible reason for what he did: as an Israeli rightwinger, he was punishing Rabin for making peace with the PLO. But it was hard to know who benefited from Glock's killing, who collected the cheque. No Palestinian political faction, such as Fatah or Hamas, had "claimed responsibility" for it, for example; indeed, Hamas even took the trouble to deny the Jerusalem Post's report that it was behind the murder.</p>
      <p>Still, from the Palestinian point of view there was plenty of circumstantial evidence to suspect an Israeli hand in the killing. Glock was shot at about 3.15pm. The army didn't arrive at the scene until some time after 6pm. Yet when, at the request of the Glock family, the Israel National Police gave a terse list of official answers about the incident to the American consulate a year later, they claimed that the IDF patrol arrived at 4.05pm, a discrepancy of two hours.</p>
      <p>Nor did the army impose a curfew even though, in the month preceding Glock's killing, two severe curfews had been imposed in the Birzeit area in response to incidents in which guns had been used by Palestinians against Israelis. The first incident was on December 1, 1991, when Israeli settlers from Ofrah, near Ramallah, were shot through the windscreen of their car as they drove through the adjoining town of al-Bireh. One of the settlers was shot in the head and later died in hospital, and his female passenger was hit by a bullet, but not fatally. Responsibility for the attack was assumed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The response of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) was immediate and severe: the entire district was closed off, roadblocks were deployed, and the army carried out thorough house-to-house searches, detained 150 people and interrogated many more than that. A heavy curfew was imposed, which lasted six weeks. Similarly, five days before the assassination of Dr Glock, a bus carrying Israeli settlers was attacked with stones and gunfire outside Ain Siniya, a village about five kilometres north of Birzeit, as it drove along the main road between Ramallah and Nablus at around 6pm one evening. No one was hurt, let alone killed, but the attack provoked a massive military response, with helicopters and house-to-house searches.</p>
      <p>Yet when, five days later, a shooting took place in a Palestinian village, and the victim died, there was no curfew at all - the army officer on the scene said that it wasn't worth it. To Gabi Baramki, the acting president of Birzeit, this response was enough to confirm his suspicion of Israeli responsibility. The two-hour delay was no accident, he thought. It was intended to give the assailants time to get away. As for the purpose of the killing, he said, "The Israelis always like to kill 100 birds with one stone." That is, the killing was intended to create fear among the Palestinian population; to damage Birzeit's reputation; to create an excuse for the military administration of the West Bank to close the university permanently, if it wanted to; to frighten the remaining foreign teaching staff at Birzeit into leaving; to spread discord and suspicion; to weaken Palestinian morale; and, above all, to rid the country of a troublesome intellectual who was literally digging up embarrassing facts. This remains the general Palestinian view. Still, Baramki took the trouble to contact PLO headquarters in Tunis to see if they knew anything about the killing: they might have received some information if it had been the work of one of the PLO's radical factions. In the event, not only did PLO headquarters deny any knowledge or involvement, it ordered Baramki to commission an investigation into the killing.</p>
      <p>Most of the work of the investigation was carried out by a local Palestinian journalist, Nabhan Khreishah. The object of his report, he said, was so that PLO leader Yasser Arafat could have something in his briefcase that he could show people, something that cleared the Palestinians, so he could say the PLO was taking Glock's murder seriously while the Israelis were not. Khreishah interviewed as many people as he could at the university, and his report focused on a matter that the Jerusalem Post had touched on in one of the articles it published in the days immediately after the killing. A teaching assistant of Glock's named Hamdan Taha had wanted Glock to give him a job at the Institute, something Glock stubbornly refused to do until at last, after a noisy argument in the teachers' union and the Birzeit University student council, Glock had reluctantly given in. For many years, Glock had held the severe and unyielding view that Taha's work was below the standard he wanted for the select group of Palestinian archaeologists he was trying to create; he did this despite the fact that most other Birzeit professors thought Taha was a positive asset to the university, and implored him to give the assistant a chance. It was poor judgment on Glock's part to oppose hiring a Palestinian at such a politically charged moment. Khreishah had to investigate the possibility, therefore, that Glock might - ironically, given the length of time he had lived here, and his devotion to the Palestinian cause - have been seen as an enemy of the Palestinian people as a result of his refusal to give a qualified Palestinian a job. But the dispute had been settled a month before the killing.</p>
      <p>Hamdan Taha is now director of the antiquities department of the Palestinian Authority, a branch of the PA's ministry of tourism. From his office in Ramallah, he oversees the restoration and protection of ancient sites and traditional architecture in the areas of the West Bank under PA control. In an extraordinary example of transcultural misunderstanding, the American FBI considers Taha the principal suspect in the crime because he was seen to have benefited from Glock's killing. Certainly, if you look at the matter from the wrong end of a telescope, you might dimly discern Taha prospering after Glock's death, but Taha holds a doctorate in archaeology from the University of Heidelberg, has a wife and family, and knows more about Iron Age burials than how to organise a professional assassination. He is not a credible suspect.</p>
      <p>So who did it? Consider the suspects on the Israeli side. It is the view, for instance, of the Ramallah-based human rights group al-Haq that Glock's killing was the work of an IDF undercover unit, for all the reasons expressed by Gabi Baramki. These undercover teams are small, well-trained military units charged with killing at point-blank range the more violent activists of the intifada, the ones identified by Israeli intelligence as having blood on their hands. They came into existence about a year after the intifada started, and by the time of Glock's death their activity was at its peak. By the end of 1992, such undercover units had killed more than 120 Palestinians, half of them in that year alone. And, if Glock's killing were the work of an IDF team, it would also explain the delay in the arrival of the police and the army. But the theory has its weaknesses. A more probable explanation for the delay in the arrival of the security forces was that murder investigations are the responsibility of the Israel National Police, who never went into Palestinian areas without an IDF escort. And because this was not an outbreak of anti-Israeli violence, which would have been more serious, the INP and the IDF had no need to rush to the scene. Second, if the Israeli government saw Glock as a nuisance, all it would have to do to keep him out of the country would be not to renew his visa. Glock lived in the West Bank on an Israeli tourist visa that he had to renew every three months by leaving the country and coming back in again. There was no need to kill him, and so risk jeopardising relations with the US. Third, the IDF units always made their appearances in Palestinian areas with a back-up vehicle and an ambulance, yet no such vehicles were seen in the village on the day of Glock's death. Finally, the INP's lack of success in investigating the murder probably owes more to its own institutional shortcomings than to a conspiracy. The role of the police in the occupied territories was not to preserve civil society and the rule of law. It was to "prevent activity hostile to the administration", in the words of an INP report.</p>
      <p>Another theory was that Glock was killed by militant Israeli settlers on the West Bank. A trigger-happy bunch at the best of times, a number of them had attacked a prominent Palestinian activist and Birzeit lecturer, Riad Malki, a few weeks before Glock's murder, while IDF soldiers looked on without intervening. Settlers in the Ramallah area had recently been on the rampage in town in retaliation for the shooting of a settler in al-Bireh. Killing Glock might have been their way of sending a warning to any sympathetic foreigners in Birzeit to go home. It is an indication of the fear these militant settlers inspired in Palestinian minds that this hypothesis had any currency at all, though it is unlikely that any of them had ever even heard of Albert Glock.</p>
      <p>On the Palestinian side, meanwhile, there was some speculation that Glock's killing had been an anti-collaborator killing, sparked by his unpopularity as a consequence of the Hamdan Taha dispute. By January 1992, with the intifada in a downward spiral of intra-Palestinian violence, groups of young vigilantes, ungoverned by the clandestine leadership of the intifada, had earned themselves a high profile for several violent attacks on Palestinians who were thought to be collaborating with the Israeli administration. They were especially active in the twin pressure cookers of the intifada, Gaza and Nablus, and they gave themselves scary names such as the Veiled Lions and the Black Panthers.</p>
      <p>But Glock's killing had not been like most anti- collaborator killings. As the Palestinians' investigator Nabhan Khreishah puts it, "Anti-collaborator killings are messy. When a Palestinian shoots someone, he just points the gun and goes bang bang bang bang. And bullets are precious and expensive for a Palestinian to get hold of. If a Palestinian wanted to kill an American, why would he want to kill Albert Glock, who had been here for nearly 20 years, when there are plenty of other blue-eyed people around?"</p>
      <p>The official line of the Israeli government remains that the killing was the work of a Hamas cell, led by an activist called Adel Awadallah.</p>
      <p>Just under a year after Glock's death, Israeli police arrested a 40-year-old Palestinian-American named Muhammad Salah as he was entering the Gaza Strip. The INP found that he had flown into Israel's Ben Gurion airport from his home in Chicago carrying a briefcase that contained Dollars 97,000 in cash. Salah was accused of being a senior official within Hamas, and was held in prison in Israel for nine months awaiting trial. In prison, he was subjected to interrogation by the General Security Services, the internal security and intelligence agency better known by its Hebrew initials, Shin Bet. Salah described the form his interrogation took in an affidavit. He was held in a tiny, freezing cell with no bed, and deprived of sleep for up to 48 hours at a time. (Sleep deprivation as a means of breaking a prisoner's resistance was euphemistically called "waiting" in the GSS lexicon.) He was kept awake by being bound for long periods in a sitting position on to a child's chair, an unnatural posture that quickly becomes extremely painful. At other times, he was handcuffed to a chair with a sack over his head, and at night his cell was blasted with loud music. Mostly, the torture was psychological. He was forced to undress and stand naked, with an interrogator threatening to photograph him in that state if he did not co-operate. He was threatened with violence against himself, against his family outside, and with long imprisonment. Such methods have since been outlawed by the Israeli supreme court.</p>
      <p>Salah's interrogation produced a wealth of material about Hamas operations in the West Bank and Gaza. Never before had the Israelis reaped such a rich haul of information about an organisation that was at this point in history still only vaguely known, and the Israelis made no secret about the prize that had fallen into their hands, even though the information gleaned must be treated with caution because it was obtained by torture. Among the information Salah provided was a vague remark that seemed to refer to the murder of Glock. Salah described conversations he had had with the Hamas activist Adel Awadallah. Salah was travelling around the occupied territories hearing progress reports from Hamas cells and disbursing money for future operations. The Israeli government claims that, in the course of reporting to Salah, Awadallah told him that his cell had been responsible for "the operation of the doctor at Birzeit", but did not go into any detail or give any reason for it, other than the obscure explanation that he "cursed Muslims". Adel Awadallah was later held responsible for organising a number of Hamas bombings in Israel, including the September 1997 bombing in the Ben Yehuda Street market in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>If true, what this means is that, far from being a well-organised, clandestine paramilitary operation, as Hamas is usually perceived to be, in the early 90s a Hamas cell such as the one run by Awadallah could operate virtually autonomously, and that Awadallah could direct people to carry out a killing without reference to the movement's high command. Indeed, as if embarrassed by the killing, eight days after Glock's death, Hamas headquarters issued a public denial that it was responsible.</p>
      <p>Even if one is convinced by the hypothesis that Hamas carried out the killing, one can still only speculate about its motive. Adel Awadallah was based near enough to Birzeit to have heard the story about the American professor who had blocked the appointment of a qualified Palestinian, and was therefore a foreign enemy, a collaborator, and also to have known Hamas sympathisers - students, maybe - who had sufficient local knowledge to carry out the shooting. A Hamas cell, whether led by Awadallah or just equipped by him, may have undertaken to kill Glock as an independent freelance operation, something that the movement's higher circles sought to distance themselves from because it was so unhelpful to the Palestinian cause.</p>
      <p>Today, Adel Awadallah is unavailable for comment, however. On September 10, 1998, Adel and his brother Imad, by this time Israel's and the Palestinian Authority's most wanted men, were ambushed in a farmhouse near Hebron by a special unit of the Israel National Police. Both were shot dead. The INP's investigation into the murder of Albert Glock remains open.</p>

      <title>Saturday review: Men of letters, men of arms: The Maze prison was a grim symbol of the Troubles. But, as Kirsty Scott reveals, it was also home to a remarkable library amassed by IRA prisoners</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>On Saturday July 8 this year, Yvonne Murphy, head of the political collection at Belfast's Linen Hall library, drove the 10 miles south-west from the city to the gates of the Maze prison. The authorities had been expecting her, and she came away with seven large brown paper sacks stuffed with books.</p>
      <p>There were more than 1,700 of them. Books that told tales beyond the words they held. Books on politics and revolution, history, literature, language, and sociology. Books with spines split by overuse, pages thumbed thin, corners folded sharp as shirt collars, margins laddered with neat and painstaking notes.</p>
      <p>This was the library of the IRA.</p>
      <p>They used to say you could lose your sight if you were long enough at the Maze, so monotonously grey were the walls and wire. This bleak compound has become a headstone for Northern Ireland's agony. From the early internment camp of Long Kesh to the notorious H-blocks, through the blanket protest and the hunger strike to the genesis of the peace process and the final closing of its gates this summer, the story of the Maze is the story of the Troubles. And that story can be followed in the books that found their way into its cells.</p>
      <p>For the last four months, the books that Yvonne Murphy retrieved have been listed and studied in the depths of the Linen Hall. This week they will be boxed up and returned to the republican ex-prisoners, and Murphy fears they might be lost for ever. She has no doubts about their cultural and political significance</p>
      <p>"You have this very famous group of prisoners reading this material. For the whole period of the peace process the prisoners were viewed as very important and this was informing what they thought. It is hugely significant.</p>
      <p>"We had heard there was this unofficial library, this vast resource, in the Maze, so we made contact with the IRA and the prison authorities and got permission to collect and record it."</p>
      <p>Murphy is desperate to find a loyalist equivalent but has been unable to ascertain if one exists. There have been casually flung rumours that the loyalist collection consisted largely of a stash of pornography, body- building magazines and the biographies of serial killers. Loyalists who served time in the Maze tell a different story; of a passion for books to match the republicans', and a hunger for knowledge in a setting stripped of stimulation. But no evidence of any loyalist library has survived.</p>
      <p>The IRA collection is almost exclusively paperback; hardbacks hide weapons. They are almost all worn, though not carelessly so. There is little doodling and almost no defacing. There are at least 11 copies of Lenin's The State and the Revolution, one carefully re- covered in a smoothed-out brown paper bag. There are also numerous copies of Marx and Engels' Manifesto of the Communist Party, and works by Freud, Trotsky, Kafka and Mao Zedong. There are biographies of Margaret Thatcher, Enoch Powell and Ian Paisley, and books on Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Palestine, South Africa and the Basque separatists.</p>
      <p>Frantz Fanon's classic anti- colonial text, The Wretched of the Earth, sits beside Henry Pelling's Origins of the Labour Party and works by the Brazilian theorist Paolo Freire. There is a shelf full of National Geographic magazines dating from 1974 to 1997 and a broad range of Irish-language texts as well as numerous works by Irish writers and thinkers. Ernie O'Malley and Sean O' Faolain compete for space with James Joyce and the Irish Feminist Review.</p>
      <p>There is precious little light reading. Any novels are weighty and worthy; Dickens and Orwell and James Hogg's The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Jus tified Sinner. There are a couple of John Grishams and Wilbur Smiths and the only apparent example of pulp fiction is a fat paperback, whose cover promises the adventures of an SAS sergeant-major and a beautiful Soviet spy, but which contains the text of Who Framed Colin Wallace?, Paul Foot's 1989 investigative work on the jailing of a military intelligence officer.</p>
      <p>There are works that surprise by their presence and some that shock profoundly. The thin red spine of a book on the Enniskillen atrocity, when an IRA bomb killed 11 people on Remembrance Sunday in 1987, sits alongside Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, and Jonathan Glover's Causing Death and Saving Lives: The Moral Problems of Life or Death Choices.</p>
      <p>And, sometimes, amid the thought and fervour, a flash of poignancy. A parents' guide to epilepsy, a book on child development, a self-help guide to dealing with nerves, a joke book, home wine-making the right way, a pocket Roget's Thesaurus that lists three owners, a collection of Irish love stories.</p>
      <p>"The first thing that strikes you is the seriousness and breadth of the material," says Richard English, professor of politics at Queen's University in Belfast, who has done a structural analysis of the collection. "The second is the amount of leftwing material. You get a sense of a revolutionary leftist movement and this reflects the period in which the books were put together and devoured. After the hunger strikes there was a very strong leftwing commitment by the republicans. It is an evocation of a particular episode in republican thinking.</p>
      <p>"The collection also makes it clear they were just desperate for knowledge. The intensity of the material reflects that."</p>
      <p>Jackie McMullan remembers that desperation. He served 16 years in the Maze for the attempted murder of an RUC officer and was on hunger strike for 48 days. Between 1976 and 1981, during the blanket and dirty protests, inmates were not allowed any reading material apart from the Bible.</p>
      <p>"You can imagine there was a massive appetite for reading immediately after the blanket protest," McMullan says. "I had a list of about 20 books in my head. At the start it was only religious books we were allowed. But we were flexible enough to turn that into religious novels. Believe it or not, some of them are half decent. After a couple of years we were able to get political books."</p>
      <p>McMullan's imagined list included John Reed's memoir of the Russian revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World; Wilfred Burchett's Grasshoppers and Elephants: Why Vietnam Fell; and Orwell's Homage to Catalonia.</p>
      <p>"I got them all and I read them in about three weeks. I'm not a fast reader. I've known guys who can read 600 pages a day. I would read about 200 pages a day but there were weeks where I read three books, one after the other."</p>
      <p>Rejecting the prison education service, the IRA set up its own education structure in the Maze. The pounds 2 a week they got from the prison authorities was pooled to buy tobacco and set up a book fund. Copies came from friends, relatives and bookstores in Ireland and England.</p>
      <p>"For us, education was central," says McMullan, who now runs a support group for ex-prisoners. "We used to say, 'You could be here for the next 20 years. You don't want to leave jail exactly as you came in. Put it to good use.' It was a driving force. It was very central to what we were all about.</p>
      <p>"The books we were really interested in were in relation to foreign struggles; Vietnam, Nicaragua, written revolution, Marxist Leninism, Irish history. There was a period after the protest when we were just totally Marxist Leninist; anything else was just not worthwhile. Even if you had a book on anarchists you would have not been taken seriously. If you had got a book in on football you would have got a bit of stick. It would have been like getting a comic. You would have to hide it.</p>
      <p>"We had just come out of five intensive years of protest. Ten of our friends and comrades had died in the hunger strike. We were pretty serious people at that stage."</p>
      <p>Danny Morrison, former publicity director for Sinn Fein, who served time in the Maze in the early 1990s, believes the intensity relating to the books reached an unhealthy level in the earlier days. As the inmates struggled to find a focus for their beliefs and used literature and learning to inform and fine-tune their attitudes, their families were dealing with the stark financial and social realities of life beyond the wire.</p>
      <p>"I think the books are probably a a microcosm of the type of thinking that was going on. There was just this massive drive for a more ideological foundation for their beliefs," said Morrison. "But I believe that the atmosphere was so rarefied that it led to a distortion of the analysis. There was too much emphasis on Marxism and, I thought, too much dependence on the theoretical, particularly of a Marxist bent. It had to be tempered with the practicalities of life."</p>
      <p>Morrison, now a writer, said the thinking, and the books, began to change with the collapse of communism, a shift that coincided with IRA inmates being paroled and a new generation of republican prisoners arriving.</p>
      <p>"After the fall of the Berlin wall, the prisoners had to realign themselves and I think it was quite a shock to the main thinkers. They had been out of contact with the outside world and reality. I think after that people fell back into more traditional republican analysis. Certainly a more pragmatic approach started to be adopted.</p>
      <p>"At that stage the republicans started taking parole. They had been in for 15 or 16 years and they were now getting out for a weekend and that informed their attitudes. Then there were others coming in from the 1980s with a less doctrinal approach."</p>
      <p>Richard English notes that the IRA's identification with flashpoints elsewhere in the world tracks through the books. "The two places that seemed to be the most telling were the Middle East and South Africa," he says. "There are obvious differences between Northern Ireland and those two, but for the republicans the identification with Palestine and the blacks of South Africa had a resonance that was very important to them. In some way developments in those areas of peace processes meant that there was an echo of the kind of changes happening in the republican movement and a kind of reinforcement of that shift."</p>
      <p>The fall of communism was deeply unsettling for the republican inmates, and McMullan says the collection reflects the reorientation taking place beyond the prison walls. "It did have an effect," he says. "Not to the extent where people would say, 'That's it, we can forget about it.' People adapted. In the late 80s more would have got into feminism, ecology and environmental issues."</p>
      <p>He says the 1,700 books held at the Linen Hall library are representative but are only a fraction of the entire IRA Maze collection, which he estimates at 16,000 works. Most were taken home when the prisoners left.</p>
      <p>There is talk of setting up a lending library with the remaining books, but McMullan is still wondering what to do with the part of the collection that the Linen Hall librarians have yet to see; five boxes full of the IRA's own works from the Maze - essays, theses, notes, letters and memos. They include a history of the prison in 24 chapters, a notebook titled Scenarios for a British Withdrawal, a five-page handwritten essay on Morality of the Armed Struggle, another notebook titled The Guerrilla Fighter, and letters from solicitors and politicians.</p>
      <p>McMullan believes it is priceless. Richard English has seen the collection and believes that the seeds of the peace process may lie in the level of serious reflection infused in the documents and papers. As with the books that the Linen Hall has already studied and listed, the material in McMullan's boxes maps out the shifts and developments in republican think ing over the years: a thorough exploration of ideology.</p>
      <p>Frankie Gallagher, however, might think it was propaganda. Gallagher, who works with loyalist ex-prisoners in east Belfast, says they felt no need to create an archive from the Maze or publicise their reading matter.</p>
      <p>"The loyalists were very much a reactionary force," he said. "They were husbands, fathers, grandfathers who reacted to the bombs and the killing, the republican violence. And it was done in the background of what they saw as the government they were trying to defend imprisoning them. So it was not an ideology, a struggle for loyalists. It never came to that. That is why the loyalists didn't have the central plank of organising things or keeping things for posterity. They weren't into propaganda."</p>
      <p>But they were into books, according to Martin Snodden, who served 15 years in the Maze for murder and is now director of EPIC, a support group for UVF ex-prisoners. "Books were almost in a sense like a life's blood," he said. "It was information. There was a hunger with regards to knowledge that existed within the prison itself from books to the quality papers like the Sunday Times and the Observer. They were scanned in great detail and there were waiting lists to read them. The Sunday Times would come in and it could be the following Wednesday before you got a look at it.</p>
      <p>"There was no library as such. You have to understand that in the loyalist wings people more or less had their own books and they were passed between us. My experience was that if someone had a book in there were about 20 people waiting to read it. There were Irish history books, and other books on politics and social injustice."</p>
      <p>Snodden's colleague at EPIC, Tom Roberts, who spent time in the H-blocks, said he and many of his fellow loyalist inmates took full advantage of the education service offered through the prison, and he dismisses the rumours that the loyalists' private collection was mostly made up of pornographic and weightlifting magazines.</p>
      <p>"I can assure you that was not the case. Everybody had their own taste. There were a lot of history books, Irish history, English history and a lot about other conflicts in other parts of the world. There was a lot of educational reading went on, because many of us did degrees.</p>
      <p>"I am not denying that people would have read whatever they would like to read and that includes the republicans. I think prisoners are like every cross- section of society. There is a wide variation in tastes."</p>
      <p>Yet for all their differences, the books that filled the Maze show that those divided by politics and prison partition were linked by a common thread - a need to learn and an abiding love of literature.</p>
      <p>In the days when books were still banned, Jackie McMullan managed to get hold of a smuggled copy of Robert Tressell's passionate defence of socialist ideals, The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. He read 100 pages before it was confiscated and had to wait five years to finish it. It has stuck with him ever since.</p>
      <p>Across in the loyalist block, Martin Snodden, too, had a book that had gripped him and stayed with him during his time inside - The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists. "The shared interests on the opposing sides have become clearer now they have left the Maze," says Richard English. "And we see there is a human community around all of these people. They did some appalling things but there is a poignancy on all sides. The whole thing looks tragic and frankly rather futile now. There is just a terrible sadness to it all."</p>

      <p>The three week Australian tennis 'season' (like the Australian golf season except hotter) climaxes with the Australian Open finals on the weekend of January 28-29.</p>
      <p>Australian hopes rest on the much-maligned man-child Nick Kyrgios whom good judges (Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray) suggest has the game to become a world No1 and major championship winner.</p>
      <p>"[Kyrgios] is a player who has an unbelievable potential," said Nadal. "He has focus on himself, and can become world No1 and win a Grand Slam."</p>

      <p>Few doubt Kyrgios's ability to belt premium Wilsons across a 3 1/2 foot net with a Yonex EZONE DR 98 at extremely high speeds and odd angles. Kyrgios has huge game. What's in doubt - perhaps massive doubt - is his ability to behave with more maturity than a spoiled and sulky 14-year-old heir to a European principality.</p>
      <p>In cricket, Australia will play the third Test match against Pakistan (Jan 3-7) followed by a five-match one-day series against the same opponent (Jan 13-26). The Big Bash League will run concurrently and conclude January 28 before it's across the ditch where Australia play three ODIs against New Zealand (Jan 30-Feb 5).</p>
      <p>Then Australia will field two (2) international teams when Australia plays a three-match series against Sri Lanka (Feb 17-22) before Australia (another one) plays India in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at Pune (Feb 23-27). Because that's how things in the international bartering and mutual back-scratching of international cricket scheduling work.</p>
      <p>In the Tests, Indian spinner Ravi Ashwin should be the pivotal man of the series given he's the second quickest ever to take 200 wickets - behind Clarrie Grimmett, but in front of Dennis Lillee, Waqar Younis Dale Steyn.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Australia was horribly found out at against the spin of Sri Lanka's podgy 38-year-old left-arm orthodox man Rangana Herath. Granted the man has 351 Test wickets. But Anil Kumble he isn't. Matt Renshaw, Peter Handscomb, Usman Khawaja and Nic Maddinson (if he makes it back into the fold) have never played Test cricket against India - much less in India.</p>
      <p>In four Tests in India in 2013 David Warner scored 195 runs at 24. Steve Smith is the outlier, Australia's AB De Villiers. Mitchell Starc will get some reverse swing and Josh Hazlewood will toil on in - quick enough and good enough. But Nathan Lyon seems to bowl the same seed time after time while Stephen O'Keefe just seems next in line. Things do not bode well.</p>
      <p>Matters appear brighter for women's sport, particularly Australian rules football which kicks off its inaugural, televised eight-team women's AFL competition on February 3rd with, you beauty, Carlton versus Collingwood. Matches run over four 15-minute quarters, with 16 players a side and a six-woman bench. There'll be seven rounds and a grand final on March 25th. And you should really catch a game if you can, it's open footy, and entertaining.</p>
      <p>Australia's gold medal-winning women's sevens team will run about in the super-hot Sydney Sevens (Feb 3-5) with Charlotte Caslick, Ellia Green and Alicia Quirk looking to capitalise on the momentum that made them Olympic champions and stars. Andy Friend's men's team disappointing in the Olympics but only narrowly lost to New Zealand in the final in 2016.</p>
      <p>The final round of the National Basketball League takes place Feb 9-12 before a four team finals series. A new netball season (from Feb 23) will pit Collingwood- and GWS Giants-backed teams against the likes of Sydney Swifts and Melbourne Vixens.</p>
      <p>The Super rugby season kicks off (Feb 23) with Melbourne Rebels hosting Auckland Blues at AAMI Stadium. Elsewhere Reds host Sharks, Waratahs host Force while ACT Brumbies travel to Canterbury for a night with the Crusaders.</p>
      <p>All pretty fair and entertaining contests. Yet the tournament remains in something of a flux. Ratings, crowds, mentions in the media, are all trending downwards, and there's no indication things will change. Star players are drawn to Europe, the Western Force is under ARU administration, club land is at war with the governing body, and David Pocock is being well paid to save rhino tusks in Africa.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Brumbies are still mired in the fog of two years of fear and loathing, court cases and suppression orders over a KPMG report that's still causing high angst in the capital. (And if its contents are ever aired and illegality alleged, watch this space, for some heavy hitters will have a day in court.)</p>
      <p>The season will again be interrupted by the June international Test 'window' most notably a tour of New Zealand by British and Irish Lions. And that should be very good. The Wallabies, meanwhile, will host Fiji (in Melbourne), Scotland (at Sydney's Allianz Stadium) and Italy (at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane) on the first three Saturdays in June.</p>
      <p>While these inbound tourists would appear a drawcard on par with Uruguay, Zimbabwe and Spain, the ARU has done one smart thing: each Test match kick-off is 3pm. The tradition of rugby long lunches returns. Then, after the Tests it's All Blacks vs Lions on the box.</p>
      <p>And then we're into the Bledisloe Cup and tyro locks Adam Coleman and Rory Arnold can enhance their growing reputation with bullish performances against whichever husky light-towers the All Blacks trot out, the country has a production line of these uber-people. And with Pocock in rhino country the ABs are again better than odds-on to retain the trophy for the 74,000th time.</p>
      <p>Rugby league! First round of the ever-entertaining and kooky National Rugby League pits premiers Cronulla Sharks against Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp on a Thursday night (Mar 2).</p>
      <p>Related: The 2016 Rusties: Guardian Australia's alternative sporting awards</p>
      <p>And that should pack them in, and no argument. Twenty-fours later Robbie Farah's Rabbitohs take on Jason Taylor's Wests Tigers, and say what you will about the NRL's crack scheduling squadron, these people have a sense of humour.</p>
      <p>Saturday night Cowboys versus Raiders in Townsville should be a ripper, while here we go again, Manly and Parramatta, locking horns at the dear old dilapidated suburban soul town of Brookvale Oval on a no-doubt sweltering Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Come May 31 it's State of Origin 1 in Brisbane, with selection discussion dominating the wires roughly one second after full-time sounds between Manly and Parra. Or even sooner: The Blues showed plenty to win game three of 2016 with Jack Bird and Tyson Frizell emerging as a new breed of Bluesmen.</p>
      <p>And they go in knowing that surely, one day, Maroons' master warriors Cam Smith, Cooper Cronk, Greg Inglis and Johnathan Thurston must slow down. Mustn't they?</p>
      <p>They won't before the rugby league World Cup (Oct 27-Dec 2) which administrators are wisely taking to Port Moresby, Perth, Christchurch and Darwin, and away from cynical, sophisticated Sydney town which won't host a finals match, but rather England versus Lebanon (Nov 4) and Australia versus Lebanon (Nov 11). The 14-team tournament will have two groups of four and two groups of three (because rugby league) with Australia expected to dominate England, France, Lebanon, New Zealand, Samoa, Scotland, Tonga, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, USA, Wales, Ireland and Italy.</p>
      <p>The AFL season kicks off with a Thursday night blockbuster at Etihad Stadium, Carlton and Richmond (Mar 23). A night later at the Melbourne Cricket Ground it's premiers Western Bulldogs against the most loved-and-loathed club in Australian sport, Collingwood Magpies, and they'll just about fill the old girl for that. One player to watch is North Melbourne's Mason Wood, 23, who showed plenty of potential before a knee injury struck him down in July of last year. Wood has hyper-athleticism and a mighty kick.</p>
      <p>The Australian Formula One Grand Prix kicks off the weekend of March 25-26 and will see Australia's toothsome tearaway Daniel Ricciardo scream around Melbourne's Albert Park in his Red Bull Renault (pending no late interest from Mercedes).</p>
      <p>Ricciardo was third overall in 2016 though managed just one top-of-podium finish. He placed fourth in this race (in 2015) and second (in 2014 though he was DQ'd). Ricciardo says on his website that he's looking forward to 2017 because slight rule modifications mean extra cornering speed. Ricciardo has spent the off-season doing strength training and says it's "time to unlock the hidden Honey Badger."</p>
      <p>April 6-9 will see Adam Scott and Jason Day head the Australian charge to a green jacket at Augusta National. Both players time their schedules to peak around the Major Championships, both players know Augusta and its undulations as well as anyone going around.</p>
      <p>Scott has one green jacket. Day has been close several times. The international depth is strong - but of all the majors, given the tournament's predilection to invite back past champions (Larry Mize, for instance) and that it's on the same course each year, it's perhaps the 'easiest' of the big four to win.</p>
      <p>And finally, in the end of April, the six-team A-League finals begin. And we will talk no doubt much more of them.</p>

      <title>Is the tiny town of Vals really the right place for the tallest building in Europe?</title>
      <subtitle>Plans for a 381m high luxury hotel tower in a sleepy Alpine village have just been unveiled - and the designer is convinced it will fit right in. But is it any more than a castle in the air?</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>"Vals' magic formula is very simple," reads the promotional blurb for the 7132 hotel at Swiss architect Peter Zumthor's famous alpine spa resort, which has been a site of worship for countless design pilgrims since it opened in 1996. "1000 residents, 1000 sheep and 1000 hotel beds. This magical ratio is the secret of the relaxed atmosphere in the Vals valley. Discretion is everything."</p>
      <p>Not any more. The owners of the hotel - property developer Remo Stoffel and local quarry entrepreneur Pius Truffer - have today unveiled plans to build the tallest building in Europe right next door, an 80-storey silo stuffed with luxury bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The new hotel tower, designed by Pritzker prizewinner Thom Mayne's practice, Morphosis, will shoot up 381m into the clouds (almost a third taller than the Shard), a looming spectre visible for miles around the tiny alpine village. It is a gigantic mirror-clad middle finger aimed at the region; indeed, it's hard to imagine a more obnoxious gesture to inflict on a sleepy spa town.</p>
      <p>In a design statement that verges on farce, Mayne describes the proposal as "a minimalist act that reiterates the site and offers to the viewer a mirrored, refracted perspective of the landscape." He suggests that it might be possible to hide 53,000 sq m of luxury development with a trick of the light, noting that "the tower's reflective skin and slender profile camouflage with the landscape, abstracting and displacing the valley and sky."</p>
      <p>Will his gargantuan stack of 107 guest rooms and suites, spas and ballroom, library, restaurants, cafes, sky bars and swimming pool - not to mention the art gallery - really disappear in a shimmering apparition? More likely they'll cast a long shadow over the region, standing as an omnipresent overblown monument to the hoteliers' greed.</p>
      <p>"I know we're reaching for the stars," said Truffer, speaking to 20 Minuten newspaper. "We want to build one of the five best hotels in the world." Aimed at ultra-high net worth tourists from Asia and the Middle East, the cheapest rooms will be around 1,000 Swiss francs (£675) a night, while the most expensive will go for a bank-busting 25,000 Swiss francs (£16,000).</p>
      <p>The project has been plagued by controversy from the start, since Stoffel took control of the Therme spa in 2012, against a rival consortium led by Peter Zumthor, in a bitter blow to the building's original architect.</p>
      <p>The competition for the new development, launched last year, made headlines when the international jury walked out of the process in February, dissociating itself from the client's decision. In an official statement, the jury said the process left "important questions unanswered" and that "significant question marks" had been raised over various factors, including the project's proposed scale.</p>
      <p>Others have been more matter-of-fact in their condemnation. "Skyscrapers in the Alps are an absurdity," said Vittorio Lampugnani, Professor of Architecture at the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, adding that there is no need to accommodate people in such a small space in the mountains.</p>
      <p>"It's marketing," architecture critic Benedict Loderer told Basler Zeitung newspaper, saying he didn't think the project would come to fruition. "It's a question of the skyscraper's position. If you put it in a valley, that's relatively meaningless."</p>
      <p>The project has yet to receive planning permission, and will have to go to a public vote of Vals residents - who may yet be convinced.</p>
      <p>"If they have the feeling of being left out, or have a sense of entitlement that they deserve such a project, they might very well vote in favour," a local source told the Guardian. "But then again, they might just dismiss it as a 'Luftschloss' - a castle in the air."</p>

      <title>G2: Arts: Portrait of the artist: Michael Boyd, theatre director: 'Theatre is in danger of becoming a gorgeous plaything of the wealthy'</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>What first drew you to theatre?</p>
      <p>Playing. Discovering as a child that I could create a world that was more the way I wanted life to be. Theatre-going was not a big thing for me. I saw Alastair Sim as Captain Hook, which was great; and Laurence Olivier in The Merchant of Venice, but there was a big pillar in the way.</p>
      <p>What was your big breakthrough?</p>
      <p>Getting a British Council fellowship to go to Moscow as a trainee director in 1979. It was an inspiration to sit in rehearsal rooms in an unfree society, seeing how theatre artists responded.</p>
      <p>Did you have a plan B?</p>
      <p>I applied to be a researcher at the South Bank Show while waiting for the Moscow job. But my real fantasy career would be architecture. I had a lovely opportunity to be a trainee architect in the rebuilding of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (1)</p>
      <p>You spent a decade as artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company. What was your biggest challenge in that role?</p>
      <p>Taking an organisation the world took a dim view of (2) and making it thrive. That was frightening. Then directing the eight-play history cycle in two years while running the place. I was so tired, but there's a benefit to working like that: a lot of your editorial control goes, and you act instinctively.</p>
      <p>What's the greatest threat to theatre?</p>
      <p>Becoming a gorgeous plaything of the wealthy. As arts education is threatened in state schools, and university fees discourage arts graduates, theatre is in danger of self-selecting the wealthy. The artists will just talk about themselves, and we'll go back to the Noel Coward days.</p>
      <p>What's the best advice anyone ever gave you?</p>
      <p>Giles Havergal, who ran the Citizens theatre in Glasgow when I was starting up the Tron (3) just across the Clyde, said: "Balance the books and you'll keep your artistic freedom."</p>
      <p>Which artists do you most admire?</p>
      <p>Ted Hughes for the power of his language; Philip Roth for his work's complex passion and compassion; Louise Bourgeois for being sexy, playful, inventive and hopelessly human.</p>
      <p>What's the biggest myth about directing?</p>
      <p>That all directors are power freaks. Confidence is required to stand up in a room as convenor, editor, puppet-master, or whatever it is you want to be. But directors need humility as well.</p>
      <p>What's the worst thing anyone ever said about you?</p>
      <p>I was inoculated early by the Birmingham Post with a review that began, "I would rather go to the dentist than sit through this 90 minutes again." (4)</p>
      <p>Who would play you in the film of your life?</p>
      <p>Bill Nighy, if I was lucky.</p>
      <p>IN SHORT:</p>
      <p>Born: Belfast, 1955</p>
      <p>Career: Has worked at the Belgrade, Coventry; Sheffield Crucible; and Tron, Glasgow. Artistic director of the RSC from 2002 to 2012.</p>
      <p>High point: "The last night of the complete Histories cycle at the Roundhouse in London."</p>
      <p>Low point: "A production in which two cast members had a brain tumour, another was very ill, and someone else got badly injured."</p>
      <p>Interview by Laura Barnett. Michael Boyd directs The Big Meal at the Bath Theatre Royal from 6 March. Details: theatreroyal.org.uk.</p>
      <p>Foot notes (1) The RSC rebuilt its auditorium in Stratford under Boyd's directorship (2) Boyd's RSC predecessor, Adrian Noble, came in for a lot of criticism (3) Boyd was first artistic director of the Tron, from 1984 until 1996 (4) The play was Blood and Ice by Liz Lochhead, who also called this review her worst ever (even though she agreed with it)</p>

      <p>Evening summary</p>
      <p>We're closing up the US politics blog for tonight. An updated summary:</p>
      <p>Donald Trump said whether to ease physical distancing guidelines is the biggest decision he'll ever make. He also said his appearances at the coronavirus taskforce briefings are the "saddest" ones he's had to do.</p>
      <p>New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, is cautiously optimistic the infection rate is slowing in his state. New York City crossed 5,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of 5pm tonight.</p>
      <p>State officials are moving forward with vote-by-mail steps despite Trump's unsubstantiated warnings. Meanwhile, Wisconsin health officials are studying how many coronavirus cases may be linked to the state's in-person voting day.</p>
      <p>A major coronavirus outbreak at a homeless shelter in San Francisco renewed demands from advocates that the city prevent a devastating spread of infection by housing the homeless in the city's many empty hotel rooms.</p>
      <p>Activists and family members are holding socially distant protests to demand the release of loved ones incarcerated in prisons and jails across the United States. In New York tonight, activists held a candlelight vigil over social media. In Richmond, Virginia, they rallied in their cars. " My son is essential to me," one mother of a jailed 19-year-old wrote on her protest sign.</p>

      <p>Move homeless into hotel rooms, advocates plead after major shelter outbreak</p>
      <p>Advocates have been pleading for weeks that San Francisco move people out of homeless shelters and into hotel rooms, given that the conditions inside these facilities are often unsanitary and crowded, making it easy for a virus to quickly spread.</p>
      <p>Now, there has been a major coronavirus outbreak inside a homeless shelter in San Francisco: nearly 70 residents at MSC South have tested positive, which is roughly half of all the people who were tested.</p>
      <p>San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, said the city is now moving the rest of the MSC South residents who have not tested positive into hotel rooms and quarantining those with Covid-19 inside the shelter.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Friedenbach, the director for the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said these kinds of outbreaks will happen at every shelter if the city doesn't immediately move all residents to hotels. Some have suggested the coronavirus fatality rate for unhoused people could be significantly higher than the general population, with a 10-20% dying and 30% hospitalized, she noted.</p>
      <p>"This was preventable and predictable. You can't leave people in congregate settings, you just can't," said Friedenbach, adding that the city needs to test residents of all shelters given their potential exposure at this point. "They've waited so long."</p>
      <p>Those who remain in other shelters are now also facing strict lockdowns, where they are even more at risk of contracting the virus, said Leah Simon-Weisberg, an attorney with the Eviction Defense Collaborative.</p>
      <p>After 70 residents of a San Francisco homeless shelter test positive for Covid-19, advocates say others are trapped in lockdown in shelters with restrictions.

      <p>A black doctor who has been testing homeless people for coronavirus in Miami was handcuffed by a police officer outside his own home, and only released after his wife emerged from the house with identification, he told the Miami Herald.</p>
      <p>The doctor said he was putting old cardboard outside of his home for pickup.</p>
      <p>"Miami police, informed of the doctor's claims, said Henderson had not called the department to complain but that they were sending an investigator to the house to look into what happened," the newspaper reported. Read the full story.</p>

      <p>Report: Wisconsin tracking cases of coronavirus linked to voting day</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin state health department is tracking new cases of the coronavirus to determine whether it was spread among voters during Tuesday's spring election, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in this report spotted by my Guardian colleague Kenya Evelyn.</p>
      <p>"The state Department of Health Services and local public health officials are "monitoring" the relationship between new cases in the coming weeks and voting in person, agency officials said.</p>
      <p>"We will continue this important work to ensure that every case is followed up on, contacted, and anyone who may have been exposed notified," Department of Human Services secretary Andrea Palm said in a statement. "We hope the extraordinary efforts taken by local clerks, public health, voters, and poll workers helped minimize any transmission but we stand prepared to respond if that isn't the case."</p>
      <p>Palm said if voters were exposed to the virus, DHS and local public health officials will see new cases beginning next week.</p>
      <p>"This information will allow our surveillance epidemiologists the opportunity to identify if the election had any impact on the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin," she said. But a full picture of whether in-person voting led to more cases won't be known for several weeks, Palm said.</p>
      <p>Thousands of voters came to the polls Tuesday after a failed last-minute attempt by [Democratic] governor Tony Evers to postpone the election.</p>
      <p>Public health experts warned before and after the election took place that allowing people to vote in person could reverse progress the state has made to contain the spread of the virus.</p>

      <p>A fascinating report from CNN, about Trump trade adviser, China hawk and coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro ...</p>
      <p>In short, Navarro ...</p>
      <p>...publicly said Americans had " nothing to worry about " while he privately warned the White House that the coronavirus pandemic could cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of American lives.</p>
      <p>Axios and the New York Times reported the Navarro memos earlier in the week. So, CNN went and looked at Navarro's comments to the media around the time he wrote those memos. Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski report, in part:</p>
      <p>In Navarro's second memo, dated 23 February, he urged for immediate funding to "minimize economic and social disruption".</p>
      <p>"Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration," Navarro wrote.</p>
      <p>But at a press gaggle on 24 February, Navarro assured that coronavirus was "nothing to worry about for the American people" under Trump's leadership.</p>
      <p>"Since the day that President Trump pulled down the flights from China to the US, he has been actively leading the situation in terms of this crisis with the task force. Nothing to worry about for the American people.</p>
      <p>"This country's done a beautiful job under [the] president's leadership [sic] in terms of managing this situation. He's working on a daily basis with the task force and we're taking steps to anticipate ... where the puck's gonna be. We're skating there in defense of the American people and the American economy. So you can be sure you're that in great hands with the Trump administration."</p>
      <p>Our own Julian Borger has a lot more on the kind of hands you're in with the Trump administration in the following profile of Navarro, including:</p>
      <p>Five of Navarro's books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author's views.</p>
      <p>A former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, says: "I wouldn't trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody's sandwich and drink order correctly. I don't know how he could be put in charge of logistics.</p>
      <p>Former spokeswoman Lisa Ross says: "Peter can be a real bully and maybe that's why Trump picked him. He wanted a bully to do the job."</p>
      <p>Here's the piece in full. It's a hell of a read, under a hell of a headline:</p>

      <p>A coalition of companies, consumer advocacy groups, and research organizations submitted a letter to Mike Pence and other executive branch leaders on Thursday arguing that more should be done to thwart online fraud surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>Spearheaded by the National Consumers League and the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, the letter encouraged new guidelines around online domain registrars and other fraud prevention techniques. It was signed by more than 30 entities.</p>
      <p>Guidelines suggested include requiring domain name registrars to validate names and registration information, and to make that data accessible to federal agencies and law enforcement.</p>
      <p>This could more easily prevent scams like one case brought by the Department of Justice against coronavirusmedicalkit.com last month. The website was targeting scared consumers with misinformation, offering them fake "vaccine kits" for coronavirus for $4.95 when in fact there is no vaccine.</p>
      <p>"The Department of Justice will not tolerate criminal exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain," the assistant attorney general Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice's civil division said regarding the case.</p>
      <p>The letter also suggested Congress require all US-based domain name registrars to "immediately lock and suspend any domain name used to facilitate coronavirus and other public health scams".</p>
      <p>In addition to monitoring domain activity, the groups suggested the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission crack down on phishing campaigns - enticing consumers to click on malicious links - that exploit economic fears. From the letter:</p>
      <p>"Launch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them."</p>

      <p>About 74 miles of city streets will be blocked off for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a "slow streets initiative".</p>
      <p>The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots.</p>
      <p>"Because of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars," Schaaf said Thursday. Officials at the moment have no plans to enforce the street closures through citations.</p>
      <p>Aboout 11% of the city's land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks. Streets and sidewalks make up another 20-30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the sunny, holiday weekend that's expected.</p>
      <p>The initiative comes as data shows promising trends for the efforts to slow the spread of the virus in California. Across the state, the amount of travel has dropped precipitously, perhaps most dramatically in Los Angeles, where residents have witnessed the rare sight of traffic-free interstates and sunsets without smog.</p>
      <p>The data on residents' movement is part of what suggests to officials the state's coronavirus peak - expected in May - may not be as high as health experts initially feared. The rate of hospitalizations and admissions to the ICU has appeared to slow since last week, according to numbers the governor provided Friday.</p>

      <p>Trump claimed the US has enough beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks. "We're in great shape," he said.</p>
      <p>Reports of PPE shortages continue to be reported by healthcare staff and other essential workers in many parts of the country, who are reusing and recycling masks and gowns. This is taken from the CDC website:</p>
      <p>Strategies to Optimize the Supply of PPE and Equipmen t</p>
      <p>"PPE is used everyday by healthcare personnel (HCP) to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing care. PPE helps protect HCP from potentially infectious patients and materials, toxic medications, and other potentially dangerous substances used in healthcare delivery.</p>
      <p>PPE shortages are currently posing a tremendous challenge to the US healthcare system because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to identify alternate ways to provide patient care."</p>

      <p>Pressed on whether the United States has enough medical equipment and whether Trump offers too rosy a picture at these coronavirus taskforce briefings, Trump said he believed he the country has enough equipment and that he did not enjoy speaking at these pressers.</p>
      <p>The comments from the president came in response to a question from CNN's Jim Acosta.</p>
      <p>"These are the saddest conferences I've ever had," Trump said. I don't like doing them. Why? Because I'm talking about death... there's no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal. And I've got to make the biggest decision of my life and I've only started thinking about that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life."</p>
      <p>Trump went on to say the country has enough equipment.</p>

      <p>Fact: coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2. Nothing to do with bacteria.</p>

      <p>Trump stressed he has "absolute" authority to issue a national stay at home order but so far he's chosen not to use it. He said he preferred to let governors make that call and currently 95% of the country is under a stay at home order.</p>
      <p>"Ninety-five per cent of the country is stay at home," Trump said, pointing first to Texas, where the governor, Greg Abbott, has issued one. "He had a very strong stay at home. Ninety-five to 96% has it. South Carolina has it... 95% of the country is covered."</p>
      <p>Trump added: "Constitutionally, from a federal standpoint - if I thought there was a problem I would handle it."</p>

      <p>Fact: On 17 March, Boeing requested $60bn in government aid for the aerospace industry hit by coronavirus. The company has not yet applied for a slice of the $2tn rescue package after the chief executive apparently balked at the possibility of government equity stakes in exchange for the relief.</p>

      <p>Trump said that African Americans have more jobs under his administration.</p>
      <p>Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate was falling overall but increasing for African Americans. For example, in December 2019, the unemployment rate had fallen 3.5% for all Americans and increased to 5.9% for black Americans. So far, the mass layoffs seem to have been proportionally higher for Asians and Hispanics. Last week's unemployment benefits claims' figures showed that while whites and blacks saw job loss rates rise at the same pace, the unemployment rate for blacks stood at 6.7% - 65% higher than for whites.</p>

      <p>Fact check: Testing</p>
      <p>Trump said "there's not a lot of issues with testing"... "We've done more testing than any country in the world."</p>
      <p>While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 102 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. The UK is still way behind, having tested only 1 in 230 people by Wednesday 8 April.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, has administered at least 2,391,119 tests, according to the Atlantic's Covid Tracking Projec t - so the US has tested about 1 in every 138 people.</p>
      <p>Epidemiologists prefer to use tests per capita to compare countries: "I think the important clarification is that we should be considering the number of cases per 1 million population and considering a rate of people tested and not the absolute numbers," Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program, told CNN. "The absolute number of tests is not very meaningful."</p>
      <p>And despite the increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many folks with symptoms - including health workers - are still struggling to access tests.</p>
      <p>7.51pm BST</p>
      <p>Fact check: testing</p>
      <p>Trump bragged about the quality of tests in the US, boasting that "we've made the best tests in the world".</p>
      <p>In fact, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed. Part of the problem came from the CDC shunned the WHO template for tests, and insisted on developing a more complicated version that correctly identified Covid-19, but also flagged other viruses - resulting in false positives.</p>
      <p>Other countries - after their first coronavirus case - swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests. South Korea, which recorded its first case on the same day as the US, did so within a week. The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on 29 February, almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed.</p>

      <p>Fact check: hospital admissions and death rate</p>
      <p>Trump claimed that the rate of the virus spread is slowing down across the country, "without exception" and that the death rate in the US was lower than anywhere else in the world.</p>
      <p>According to one source, the global death is 13 per million people.</p>
      <p>The US death rate is currently 54 per million, much higher than Germany at 31 per million, Portugal at 43 per million and 14 per million in Canada, but lower than Spain, France, Italy and the UK. A few minutes later Dr Deborah Birx said: "We have not reached the peak."</p>

      <p>Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure.</p>
      <p>In the week beginning 30 March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an "emergency use authorization" to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances.</p>
      <p>Clinical trials to test the drug's effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works.</p>
      <p>So far, the evidence that it's an effective cure for coronavirus is anecdotal and mixed. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration's obsession with the drug has since been discredited.</p>
      <p>The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it's unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus.</p>
      <p>The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by.</p>

      <p>Fact check: death toll will be under 100,000 in the US</p>
      <p>Trump said his government's aggressive strategy had saved "countless lives and that great progress is being made". He claimed that the final death toll would be substantially under 100,000.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Whitehouse taskforce experts estimated the final death toll would likely be between 100,000 and 220,000 based on modelling.</p>
      <p>This week, the main model used lowered the estimated expected deaths toll by August to 60,400. But, Dr Anthony Fauci and others have warned that this depends on strict social distancing being implemented for months.</p>
      <p>The current death toll stands at 17,831.</p>

      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci speaks during a press briefingPhotograph: REX/Shutterstock</p>
      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged caution even as some parts of New York hit hardest by coronavirus begin to recover.</p>
      <p>Via Reuters:</p>
      <p>The top US infectious disease expert warned on Friday that even though hard-hit spots like New York are showing positive results in the battle against coronavirus, it is too early to relax restrictions on Americans.</p>
      <p>The warning from Dr Anthony Fauci came as the Trump administration's top economic officials said on Thursday they believe the US economy could start to reopen for normal business in May, despite health experts' urging for continued social distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Donald Trump, seeking re-election on 3 November, wants to get the economy going as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we're going to be opening up... very, very, very, very soon, I hope," he said on Thursday at the White House coronavirus briefing.</p>
      <p>Fauci, however, warned against relaxing restrictions too soon.</p>
      <p>"What we're seeing right now is favorable signs," Fauci said in an interview on CNN, citing progress in hard-hit New York. But he added, "the one thing you don't want to do is you don't want to get out there prematurely and then wind up back in the same situation".</p>
      <p>With many Americans celebrating the Easter holiday on Sunday, Fauci said it was important to keep social distancing measures in place.</p>
      <p>"Now is no time to back off," he said.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we're looking for the kinds of things that would indicate that we can go forward in a gradual way to essentially reopen the country to a more normal way," Fauci said, but that depends on a number of factors.</p>
      <p>House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi also warned Trump against trying to get back to normal prematurely.</p>
      <p>"I would hope that the scientific community would weigh in and say, 'You can't do this, it is only going to make matters worse if you go out too soon,'" Pelosi said in an interview with Politico late on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Virginia advancing gun safety measures</p>
      <p>Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has signed several new gun restrictions he championed during this year's legislative session, cementing gains by gun control advocates they hope will serve as a "blueprint" for states around the country.</p>
      <p>The Old Dominion has been the center of the nation's gun debate after Democrats took full control of the General Assembly last year on an aggressive gun control platform, The Associated Press writes.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country rallied against new gun restrictions at the state Capitol in January while lawmakers ultimately approved seven out of eight of Northam's gun-control package.</p>
      <p>Related: Virginia: thousands of armed protesters rally against gun control bills</p>
      <p>The governor announced Friday he'd signed bills that include requiring universal background checks on gun purchases, a red flag bill to allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others, and limited handgun purchases to one a month.</p>
      <p>"This is an exciting day for me," Northam said on a conference call with gun-control advocates.</p>
      <p>Virginia was once a socially conservative state where lawmakers in both parties viewed gun rights as sacrosanct and the National Rifle Association held great sway.</p>
      <p>But as the state has grown more urban and suburban, the gun lobby's influence has waned.</p>
      <p>A mass shooting last year in Virginia Beach made gun control a front-burning issue in Virginia and heavy spending by groups backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg helped Democrats flip control of the legislature in November.</p>
      <p>Related: A mass shooting couldn't happen in Virginia Beach ... until it did</p>
      <p>Gun-control advocates said Friday they're planning to replicate their success in Virginia in other states.</p>
      <p>John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said his group plans to spend heavily in key battleground states this year like Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to elect lawmakers who support new gun restrictions.</p>
      <p>Feinblatt said polling shows a gun-control agenda is popular in those states and that Virginia is a "bellwether" of what's to come.</p>

      <p>Trump encourages prayer and healing this Easter even as some churches plan gatherings</p>
      <p>The president just spoke in the Oval Office to give an Easter blessing on Good Friday, where he was joined by Maryland Bishop Harry Jackson.</p>
      <p>Trump said, according to the pool report: "Our people are making tremendous sacrifices to end this pandemic. Though we will not be able to gather together with one another as we normally would on Easter, we can use this sacred time to focus on prayer, reflection and growing."</p>
      <p>He did not, however, make a point of putting out a message that churches should not be holding in-person services on Sunday.</p>
      <p>While many religious leaders plan to hold services remotely, there are plentiful reports of churches coast to coast planning to defy physical distancing orders or guidelines and encouraging congregations to attend, risking the further spread of the coronavirus.</p>

      <p>Trump also said: "Our brave doctors, nurses and responders, first responder, responders of all, are fighting to save lives, our workers are racing to deliver critical medical supplies.

      <p>In capping off this press conference Cuomo addressed the disparities in coronavirus infections among African Americans and latinos. There have been multiple reports that the pandemic has disproportionally hit the American minority community.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is a surprise that we have a disparity among the African American and Latino community," Cuomo said. He noted that systemic racism is an ongoing problem in the country and in New York. Cuomo also noted that the disparity isn't as bad in New York as other places in the country.</p>
      <p>"We are going to do more testing in African American and Latino communities."</p>
      <p>5.16pm BST</p>
      <p>Asked about the state's stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, Cuomo sounded a calming note.</p>
      <p>"We're okay right now. We're okay. We have a stockpile where we are now relatively comfortable," Cuomo said. "Compared to how we are operating under these circumstances we are relatively comfortable on ventilators and PPE if." the hospitalization rate remains down.</p>

      <p>Cuomo is punting on Trump's repeated argument that the World Health Organization deserves some blame for the coronavirus pandemic's spread.</p>
      <p>"The president's point is the World Health Organization should've been more aggressive," Cuomo said. "This is not my field. I don't know."</p>
      <p>Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO saying it is "China-centric." Trump, during a press conference on Tuesday, said first that he would put on hold funding to the WHO and then later said his administration would consider that.</p>

      <p>Cuomo: We are flattening the curve</p>

      <p>"Is there going to be a second wave? Let's look at the countries that have gone through this process and what can we learn from them," Cuomo said. He pointed to Hong Kong:</p>
      <p>"Hong Kong recorded the biggest rise of cases and a new wave of infections. Is that true? Could it happen here? Article yesterday: Italy has seen a bump in a number of cases. Before we take this step we need to make sure we are more sure and more aware than we were in the past."</p>
      <p>But Cuomo added that New York is making progress.</p>
      <p>"So where do we go from here? First keep doing what we're doing. Stay home because that works. We are flattening the curve. We must continue flattening the curve," Cuomo said. "We need both diagnostic testing and anti-biotic testing and we need millions and millions of them and we need them in a matter of weeks, not months."</p>
      <p>He also said "we need to be more prepared as a nation."</p>

      <p>Cuomo in this press conference is offering some of his most direct arguments he's ever made on testing and whether the private sector can carry most of the burden in providing tests and help to the public on the coronavirus. He thinks it cannot.</p>
      <p>"We need an unprecedented mobilization where government can produce these tests in the millions. New York state is doing several thousand. We need 9 million people to get back to work," Cuomo said. "Private sector on their own I don't believe will be able to come to scale."</p>
      <p>Cuomo added "you're going to need government intervention to make that happen and the federal government is in the best position to do that."</p>
      <p>The New York governor also took aim at the stimulus bills Congress has passed to help businesses weather the crisis.</p>
      <p>"They've passed a couple already. Bu you need a fair federal stimulus bill that is not a federal pork barrel bill," Cuomo said. "I understand the dynamics of the US senate but this is not a time to be passing bills to make sure your home state gets enough funding. That's not what this is about. This is about helping your state come back."</p>

      <p>Cuomo went on to say that the return to normalcy will be a gradual process. It won't be an immediate thing. That's in contrast to the hopes of Trump who has privately signaled to his colleagues that he would like things to start returning to normal by next month.</p>
      <p>"The key to reopening is going to be testing," Cuomo said. "It's not going to be a light switch like you flip the economy like a light switch. It's going to be a gradual phased process and it's going to be reliant on testing."</p>

But he added that the change in intibations "is a little tick higher than it's been in the past few days. The three day average is also down. The bad news is we continue to lose a tremendous number of lives and endure great pain as a state -775 lives lost."</p>

      <p>State officials forge ahead to expand vote-by-mail despite Trump's warnings.</p>
      <p>Without evidence the president has repeatedly charged voting by mail would dilute the election process and open voting up to rampant fraud. The Associated Press reports:</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is warning without evidence that expanding mail-in voting will increase voter fraud. But several GOP state officials are forging ahead to do just that, undermining one of Trumps arguments about how elections should be conducted amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
      <p>While Trump has complained that voting by mail was ripe for fraud," Republican state officials in Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail-in ballots, following health officials warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus. The Republican governor of Nebraska urged voters to apply for absentee ballots. Florida's GOP chairman says the party will continue to run a robust vote-by-mail program.</p>
      <p>The disconnect between Trump and Republican state officials illustrates the abrupt, hard turn the president and his national political allies have taken on the issue. Before the coronavirus hit, many in the GOP had warmed to mail-in voting, agreeing that it can be conducted without fraud and even used to their political advantage.</p>
      <p>But Trump's hard line appears to be driven by his personal suspicions and concerns about his own reelection prospects. Statewide mail-in voting doesnt work out well for Republicans," he tweeted this week.</p>
      <p>Trumps comments put his Republican allies in states in the awkward position of trying to defend their practices without criticizing the president. Some said they agreed with Trump, even as their actions seem to suggest otherwise. Others suggested Trump was out of line.</p>

      <p>Top Republicans urge Trump to let advisers speak more</p>
      <p>A growing set of Republicans are urging Trump to cool it on the daily press conferences. They're arguing that a lighter touch would benefit the president more.</p>
      <p>There's Nikki Haley, the former Trump administration ambassador to the United Nations and a potential 2024 presidential candidate, who said Trump should let "his experts speak." In an interview on Fox &amp; Friends Haley praised Trump's ability to "over-communicate."</p>
      <p>"I think he should go and set the tone. I think he should let them put out the data. I think they should answer any questions that the press has. And then they should leave," Haley said. "I don't think they need to be too long. I don't think he needs to feel like he needs to answer everything."</p>
      <p>Trump's advisers are also beginning to worry about the ripple effect of Trump's long daily press conferences. It sometimes "drowns out his message," South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told the New York Times. He's urged Trump to cut down to a once-a-week presser.</p>
      <p>Trump, it should be noted, enjoys doing the press conferences.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump 's reelection campaign included an image of former Obama administration ambassador to China Gary Locke in a new attack ad. Locke, a former two-term governor of Washington, is a third generation Chinese-American who was born in Seattle.</p>
      <p>The subject of the attack ad is Joe Biden and China. The use of Locke's image implies that he is some kind of Chinese official. According to The New York Times (bolds mine):</p>
      <p>The image, which appears briefly, was pulled from a 2013 event in Beijing, where Mr. Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, shared a stage with Gary Locke, the former governor of Washington, who also served as President Barack Obama 's commerce secretary and ambassador to China. Mr. Locke is Chinese-American.</p>
      <p>"During America's crisis, Biden protected China's feelings," the online ad says, presenting a montage of clips of Mr. Biden complimenting and praising the Chinese, including the country's leader, Xi Jinping, and of a news segment accusing Mr. Biden of helping his son Hunter profit off Chinese investments. The picture of Mr. Biden and Mr. Locke is spliced in among the clips.</p>
      <p>Steve Guest, the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee tweeted that Locke is not the point of the ad. Guest was responding to a tweet from Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo:</p>
      <p>Gary Locke is not the point of this ad and you know it. In that image, there is a MASSIVE China flag behind Biden. The point of the ad is that for DECADES Biden has been soft on China. Your spin is bad and you should feel bad. https://t.co/FzyoNYO7Ra</p>
      <p>- Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) April 10, 2020</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Trump reelection team's communications director said the reason the image was included in the ad was the Chinese flag behind Biden and Locke.</p>

      <p>Here's the CNN report (bolds are from me):</p>
      <p>Former President Barack Obama on Thursday gave some advice to a group of mayors on how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, saying that "the biggest mistake any (of) us can make in these situations is to misinform."</p>
      <p>Obama was speaking during a virtual meeting organized by Bloomberg Philanthropies. "Speak the truth. Speak it clearly. Speak it with compassion. Speak it with empathy for what folks are going through," Obama said, according to a press release on the virtual meeting.Obama also pushed the mayors to bring in as many smart advisers and experts as possible.</p>
      <p>"The more smart people you have around you, and the less embarrassed you are to ask questions, the better your response is going to be," Obama said. This is the fourth virtual meeting Bloomberg's group has held with mayors. Two of the previous meetings have featured speeches by former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama has repeatedly weighed in on the response to the virus, largely offering a more cautious message than that of President Donald Trump and advocating for protecting public health over re-starting economic activity.</p>
      <p>And Obama also urged the mayors to pay special attention to the most vulnerable. Here's his remark according to a press release from Bloomberg Philanthropies:</p>
      <p>"We're seeing disparities in how people are affected in cities and towns and communities across the country. Look out for the vulnerable. When you start looking at issues of domestic abuse and you start looking at racial disparities that are popping up in your cities, paying attention to that is the kind of leadership I know all of you aspire to. You have to be intentional about it, and dedicate folks to thinking about those issues."</p>

      <p>In a half-hour interview, Pelosi issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump, urging him not to prematurely rush to reopen major segments of the country before the coronavirus is under control, which she said could further send the U.S. economy into a tailspin.</p>
      <p>"Nobody can really tell you that and I would never venture a guess. I certainly don't think we should do it sooner than we should," Pelosi said when asked if she still planned to bring the House back on April 20, which is the current target date.</p>

Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Navajo president Jonathan Nez and vice-president Myron Lizer, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. "This is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure," said Nez during an online town hall meeting.</p>
      <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April.</p>
      <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won't see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork. Nez told Arizona news outlet ABC15: "To know that those dollars allocated and signed into law are supposed to go to all US citizens, but yet the first citizens of this country are being ignored by Washington."</p>

      <p>A new CBS poll finds Americans' views on Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic is dipping again.</p>
      <p>NEW @cbsnewspoll : Views of Trump's handling of coronavirus outbreak slip again: Now is the first time more say he's doing a bad job than a good one. https://t.co/bzFV9o4mYu</p>
      <p>- Ed O'Keefe (@edokeefe) April 10, 2020</p>
      <p>According to the poll :</p>
      <p>Views on President Trump's handling of the outbreak response have ticked down for the second consecutive week. The president is seen doing a good job by 47%, down four points from 51% last week and 53% the prior week. Now is the first time more say he's doing a bad job than a good one.</p>
      <p>The president gets comparably better marks on his handling of the economic impact of the outbreak, specifically, with 51% saying he's doing a good job.</p>

      <p>Trump wants to reopen the country next month</p>
      <p>Good morning, readers.</p>
      <p>Donald Trump wants to reopen the country next month despite concerns from both economists and health experts that the coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over.</p>
      <p>Trump, according to a Washington Post report, wants to restart business by 1 May. He's worried about how the volatile stock market and unemployment numbers will reflect his chances for reelection.</p>
      <p>Publicly, Trump seems to have the backing of some of his top aides. In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said "I do" when asked if he thought the country could reopen in about a month.</p>
      <p>But health experts worry that reopening the government prematurely could dramatically reverse some of the progress the country has made in fighting the virus.</p>
      <p>Trump's concerns about a struggling economy are likely to only get worse. Economists are expecting the United States to "suffer its largest-ever contraction this quarter and the unemployment rate to soar to a post-Depression record, followed by a recovery that will be moderate and drawn out" according to Bloomberg News.</p>

An updated summary: Donald Trump said whether to ease physical distancing guidelines is the biggest decision he'll ever make. He also said his appearances at the coronavirus taskforce briefings are the "saddest" ones he's had to do. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, is cautiously optimistic the infection rate is slowing in his state. New York City crossed 5,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of 5pm tonight. State officials are moving forward with vote-by-mail steps despite Trump's unsubstantiated warnings. Meanwhile, Wisconsin health officials are studying how many coronavirus cases may be linked to the state's in-person voting day. A major coronavirus outbreak at a homeless shelter in San Francisco renewed demands from advocates that the city prevent a devastating spread of infection by housing the homeless in the city's many empty hotel rooms. Activists and family members are holding socially distant protests to demand the release of loved ones incarcerated in prisons and jails across the United States. In New York tonight, activists held a candlelight vigil over social media. In Richmond, Virginia, they rallied in their cars. "My son is essential to me," one mother of a jailed 19-year-old wrote on her protest sign. Another image for the end of this day: Need a bit of comfort at the end of another long week? (Not even sure what the end of a week feels like any more?) My colleague (and journo-dad) Mario Koran has a lovely piece from earlier today about parenting, pandemics and the wise advice of the people behind Sesame Street. More than 5,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths as of 5pm tonight in New York City alone. And that is almost certainly an undercount, with many people dying of coronavirus in their homes not being counted in the official figures. Socially distant car protest for prisoner safety in Richmond, Virginia Another way to organize a protest under a stay-at-home order? Protest in your car. Dozens of people rallied from their cars in Virginia's state capital Friday afternoon to address the state's failure to keep incarcerated inmates safe during the coronavirus pandemic, ABC 8News Richmond reported. "I don't want my son to die alone...free my son," Shontrese Otey, who has a 19-year-old son in Richmond City Jail, told 8News. She was holding a sign that read, "My son is essential to me." What does protest look like under a stay-at-home order? This evening, activists are lighting a candle in solidarity with more than 90,000 people typically incarcerated in state prisons and jails in New York state, as coronavirus threatens to turn crowded, unsanitary prisons into death traps. The protest is being organized by New York prison abolition activists, under the hashtag #FreeThemAll4PublicHealth. The protesters are calling on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other local and state leaders to use their power to release everyone incarcerated in the state. Advocates have been pleading for weeks that San Francisco move people out of homeless shelters and into hotel rooms, given that the conditions inside these facilities are often unsanitary and crowded, making it easy for a virus to quickly spread. Now, there has been a major coronavirus outbreak inside a homeless shelter in San Francisco: nearly 70 residents at MSC South have tested positive, which is roughly half of all the people who were tested. San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, said the city is now moving the rest of the MSC South residents who have not tested positive into hotel rooms and quarantining those with Covid-19 inside the shelter. Jennifer Friedenbach, the director for the Coalition on Homelessness in San Francisco, said these kinds of outbreaks will happen at every shelter if the city doesn't immediately move all residents to hotels. Some have suggested the coronavirus fatality rate for unhoused people could be significantly higher than the general population, with a 10-20% dying and 30% hospitalized, she noted. "This was preventable and predictable. You can't leave people in congregate settings, you just can't," said Friedenbach, adding that the city needs to test residents of all shelters given their potential exposure at this point. "They've waited so long." Those who remain in other shelters are now also facing strict lockdowns, where they are even more at risk of contracting the virus, said Leah Simon-Weisberg, an attorney with the Eviction Defense Collaborative. "Locking them in a congregate shelter and packing hundreds of people into one place is only endangering their lives," she said. Drone footage: pandemic San Francisco The effect of the three-week-long lockdown on daily life in San Francisco is revealed in drone footage showing empty streets and deserted landmarks. San Francisco and the counties around it was the frist region in the US to announce a 'stay-at-home' order on 16 March, restricting all but essential activities. Black doctor says he was handcuffed outside his own home in Miami A black doctor who has been testing homeless people for coronavirus in Miami was handcuffed by a police officer outside his own home, and only released after his wife emerged from the house with identification, he told the Miami Herald. The doctor said he was putting old cardboard outside of his home for pickup. "Miami police, informed of the doctor's claims, said Henderson had not called the department to complain but that they were sending an investigator to the house to look into what happened," the newspaper reported. Read the full story. The Wisconsin state health department is tracking new cases of the coronavirus to determine whether it was spread among voters during Tuesday's spring election, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in this report spotted by my Guardian colleague Kenya Evelyn. "The state Department of Health Services and local public health officials are "monitoring" the relationship between new cases in the coming weeks and voting in person, agency officials said. "We will continue this important work to ensure that every case is followed up on, contacted, and anyone who may have been exposed notified," Department of Human Services secretary Andrea Palm said in a statement. "We hope the extraordinary efforts taken by local clerks, public health, voters, and poll workers helped minimize any transmission but we stand prepared to respond if that isn't the case." Palm said if voters were exposed to the virus, DHS and local public health officials will see new cases beginning next week. "This information will allow our surveillance epidemiologists the opportunity to identify if the election had any impact on the spread of Covid-19 in Wisconsin," she said. But a full picture of whether in-person voting led to more cases won't be known for several weeks, Palm said. Thousands of voters came to the polls Tuesday after a failed last-minute attempt by [Democratic] governor Tony Evers to postpone the election. Public health experts warned before and after the election took place that allowing people to vote in person could reverse progress the state has made to contain the spread of the virus. From earlier today, a bigger picture look at Wisconsin from Sam Levine: Coronavirus in a major homeless shelter; stay-at-home extended in LA Lois Beckett here picking up our live US politics coverage from the West Coast. Here in California, Los Angeles county has announced an extension of its stay-at-home order until 15 May. And in San Francisco, one of northern California's largest homeless shelters is experiencing a serious coronavirus outbreak, the city's mayor said. Read more background on how San Francisco has failed its homeless population from my colleague Vivian Ho. That's it for me. The blog is now in the capable hands of my west coast colleague Lois Beckett. To recap: Trump said whether to ease physical distancing guidelines is the biggest decision he'll ever make. New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, is cautiously optimistic the infection rate is slowing in his state. State officials are moving forward with vote-by-mail steps despite Trump's unsubstantiated warnings. Trump said his appearances at the coronavirus taskforce briefings are the "saddest" ones he's had to do. A fascinating report from CNN, about Trump trade adviser, China hawk and coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro... In short, Navarro ... ...publicly said Americans had "nothing to worry about" while he privately warned the White House that the coronavirus pandemic could cost trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of American lives. Axios and the New York Times reported the Navarro memos earlier in the week. So, CNN went and looked at Navarro's comments to the media around the time he wrote those memos. Em Steck and Andrew Kaczynski report, in part: In Navarro's second memo, dated 23 February, he urged for immediate funding to "minimize economic and social disruption". "Any member of the Task Force who wants to be cautious about appropriating funds for a crisis that could inflict trillions of dollars in economic damage and take millions of lives has come to the wrong administration," Navarro wrote. But at a press gaggle on 24 February, Navarro assured that coronavirus was "nothing to worry about for the American people" under Trump's leadership. "Since the day that President Trump pulled down the flights from China to the US, he has been actively leading the situation in terms of this crisis with the task force. Nothing to worry about for the American people. "This country's done a beautiful job under [the] president's leadership [sic] in terms of managing this situation. He's working on a daily basis with the task force and we're taking steps to anticipate ... where the puck's gonna be. We're skating there in defense of the American people and the American economy. So you can be sure you're that in great hands with the Trump administration." Our own Julian Borger has a lot more on the kind of hands you're in with the Trump administration in the following profile of Navarro, including: Five of Navarro's books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author's views. A former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, says: "I wouldn't trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody's sandwich and drink order correctly. I don't know how he could be put in charge of logistics. Former spokeswoman Lisa Ross says: "Peter can be a real bully and maybe that's why Trump picked him. He wanted a bully to do the job." Here's the piece in full. It's a hell of a read, under a hell of a headline: A coalition of companies, consumer advocacy groups, and research organizations submitted a letter to Mike Pence and other executive branch leaders on Thursday arguing that more should be done to thwart online fraud surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. Spearheaded by the National Consumers League and the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies, the letter encouraged new guidelines around online domain registrars and other fraud prevention techniques. It was signed by more than 30 entities. Guidelines suggested include requiring domain name registrars to validate names and registration information, and to make that data accessible to federal agencies and law enforcement. This could more easily prevent scams like one case brought by the Department of Justice against coronavirusmedicalkit.com last month. The website was targeting scared consumers with misinformation, offering them fake "vaccine kits" for coronavirus for $4.95 when in fact there is no vaccine. "The Department of Justice will not tolerate criminal exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain," the assistant attorney general Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice's civil division said regarding the case. The letter also suggested Congress require all US-based domain name registrars to "immediately lock and suspend any domain name used to facilitate coronavirus and other public health scams". In addition to monitoring domain activity, the groups suggested the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission crack down on phishing campaigns - enticing consumers to click on malicious links - that exploit economic fears. From the letter: "Launch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them." About 74 miles of city streets will be blocked off for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a "slow streets initiative". The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots. "Because of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars," Schaaf said Thursday. Officials at the moment have no plans to enforce the street closures through citations. Aboout 11% of the city's land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks. Streets and sidewalks make up another 20-30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the sunny, holiday weekend that's expected. The initiative comes as data shows promising trends for the efforts to slow the spread of the virus in California. Across the state, the amount of travel has dropped precipitously, perhaps most dramatically in Los Angeles, where residents have witnessed the rare sight of traffic-free interstates and sunsets without smog. The data on residents' movement is part of what suggests to officials the state's coronavirus peak - expected in May - may not be as high as health experts initially feared. The rate of hospitalizations and admissions to the ICU has appeared to slow since last week, according to numbers the governor provided Friday. Trump just departed the briefing room. Friday's coronavirus taskforce press conference has ended. Fact Check: medical supplies Trump claimed the US has enough beds, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks. "We're in great shape," he said. Reports of PPE shortages continue to be reported by healthcare staff and other essential workers in many parts of the country, who are reusing and recycling masks and gowns. This is taken from the CDC website: Strategies to Optimize the Supply of PPE and Equipment "PPE is used everyday by healthcare personnel (HCP) to protect themselves, patients, and others when providing care. PPE helps protect HCP from potentially infectious patients and materials, toxic medications, and other potentially dangerous substances used in healthcare delivery. PPE shortages are currently posing a tremendous challenge to the US healthcare system because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Healthcare facilities are having difficulty accessing the needed PPE and are having to identify alternate ways to provide patient care." Trump: these are the saddest news conferences that I've ever had Pressed on whether the United States has enough medical equipment and whether Trump offers too rosy a picture at these coronavirus taskforce briefings, Trump said he believed he the country has enough equipment and that he did not enjoy speaking at these pressers. The comments from the president came in response to a question from CNN's Jim Acosta. "These are the saddest conferences I've ever had," Trump said. I don't like doing them. Why? Because I'm talking about death... there's no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal. And I've got to make the biggest decision of my life and I've only started thinking about that. This is by far the biggest decision of my life." Trump went on to say the country has enough equipment. "It's not 'no, no, no', it's 'yes, yes, yes'," Trump said. Fact check: what is coronavirus? Trump once again seemed to confuse bacteria with viruses when answering a question about a spike in coronavirus cases at a food processing plant in Denver. "Antibiotics used to solve everything, but the germ has gotten so brilliant that antibiotics can't keep up," said Trump. Fact: coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2. Nothing to do with bacteria. Trump on easing social distancing: I would say without question it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make The president said that deciding whether to ease recommendations on social distancing might be one of the biggest decisions, if not the biggest one, he'll have to make. Trump stressed he has "absolute" authority to issue a national stay at home order but so far he's chosen not to use it. He said he preferred to let governors make that call and currently 95% of the country is under a stay at home order. "Ninety-five per cent of the country is stay at home," Trump said, pointing first to Texas, where the governor, Greg Abbott, has issued one. "He had a very strong stay at home. Ninety-five to 96% has it. South Carolina has it... 95% of the country is covered." Trump added: "Constitutionally, from a federal standpoint - if I thought there was a problem I would handle it." Trump continued: "I have great authority to use it... I have absolute authority to use it but so far our relationship with governors, I haven't had to do it. Trump to attend Robert Jeffres service Trump said he will attend the online service of Pastor Robert Jeffres. He said he would attend Easter service digitally on a laptop. "I'm going to be with him on Easter meaning I'm going to be with him watching on a laptop," Trump said. Fact check: Boeing hasn't asked for aid Trump was asked if Boeing should be penalised for mass layoffs despite receiving federal aid. Trump claimed that Boeing, which he described as "probably the greatest company in the world", was yet to ask for aid, though he anticipated that the company would. Fact: On 17 March, Boeing requested $60bn in government aid for the aerospace industry hit by coronavirus. The company has not yet applied for a slice of the $2tn rescue package after the chief executive apparently balked at the possibility of government equity stakes in exchange for the relief. Trump plans to include governors on his new council looking at when to reopen the government. He said that includes Democrats. The president then name-checked a number of governors he gets along with. He said he just finished a phone call with New York's Andrew Cuomo. He also mentioned Phil Murphy of New Jersey. "I've actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn't have gotten to know. Governor Murphy of New Jersey's a very liberal guy. I'm not... Gavin Newsom. Honestly, fight or never," Trump added: "I've really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors. I think Mike DeWine, a Republican, I think he's doing a great job. "I'd like to have some representative governors on the council," Trump said. "So far everyone's said yes. I think everyone would like to be on that council. It's a very important council." Fact check: more jobs for African Americans since Trump took office Trump said that African Americans have more jobs under his administration. Before the pandemic, the unemployment rate was falling overall but increasing for African Americans. For example, in December 2019, the unemployment rate had fallen 3.5% for all Americans and increased to 5.9% for black Americans. So far, the mass layoffs seem to have been proportionally higher for Asians and Hispanics. Last week's unemployment benefits claims' figures showed that while whites and blacks saw job loss rates rise at the same pace, the unemployment rate for blacks stood at 6.7% - 65% higher than for whites. Asked whether he would open up the US again next month if his advisers presented him with evidence that there would be a dramatic spike of coronavirus cases Trump said he wants to get it open as soon as possible. But he isn't determined, the president said in response to a question from CNN's Jim Acosta. "I do say this Jim: I want to get it open as soon as possible," Trump said. "I would love to open it. I'm not determined." He said that he would unveil a new taskforce of counsel to advise him on dealing with coronavirus and when to reopen the country. He said he would discuss it more next week Trump said it would be bipartisan. "The one thing I didn't ask 'are you a Republican or Democrat' and I want their views on what they think," Trump said. Trump is not backing away from comments he made vowing to look at funding to the World Health Organization. The president said he would discuss it more next week. He also sounded that he was open to cutting funding to the organization. Surgeon General Adams was asked about urging African Americans to avoid alcohol and tobacco. He said: "If not for yourself, then for your abuela. Do it for your grand-daddy. Do it for your big mama. Do it for your pop-pop." Adams was asked if that language was appropriate. He said he felt it was because that's the language used in his family. "That was not meant to be offensive. That's the language that I use and we use," Adams said. But he added that he would make those recommendations to all American. "All Americans need to avoid these substances at all times," Adams said. Fact check: Testing Trump said "there's not a lot of issues with testing"... "We've done more testing than any country in the world." While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 102 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. The UK is still way behind, having tested only 1 in 230 people by Wednesday 8 April. Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, has administered at least 2,391,119 tests, according to the Atlantic's Covid Tracking Project - so the US has tested about 1 in every 138 people. Epidemiologists prefer to use tests per capita to compare countries: "I think the important clarification is that we should be considering the number of cases per 1 million population and considering a rate of people tested and not the absolute numbers," Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program, told CNN. "The absolute number of tests is not very meaningful." And despite the increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many folks with symptoms - including health workers - are still struggling to access tests. Fact check: testing Trump bragged about the quality of tests in the US, boasting that "we've made the best tests in the world". In fact, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed. Part of the problem came from the CDC shunned the WHO template for tests, and insisted on developing a more complicated version that correctly identified Covid-19, but also flagged other viruses - resulting in false positives. Other countries - after their first coronavirus case - swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests. South Korea, which recorded its first case on the same day as the US, did so within a week. The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on 29 February, almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed. Trump on warnings about reopening by 1 May: I will certainly listen Trump was pressed on whether he would heed the warnings of health officials, including some who advise him, as to whether the country could reopen by early May. Trump has reportedly been hoping to see that. At first he digressed. "I listen to them about everything," Trump said. "I have great respect for these people. All of them. Trump joked: "In fact I told Tony Fauci, why don't you move to New York, run against AOC, you will win easily. I kid, you know that." Asked again he didn't budge. "I can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these doctors and we've done very well," Trump said. "I have great respect for these people. I'm never saying bad about these people." And then pressed a third time, Trump said: "I will certainly listen. I will certainly listen. There are two sides. Remember, I understand both sides of an argument very well." Fact check: oil reserves Trump said the US probably has the biggest oil reserves in the world. According to the World Population Review, Venezuela has the biggest crude oil reserves, followed by Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran and Iraq. The US is 11th - sandwiched in between Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Mike Pence just now just urged churches and other religious "to heed the guidelines" and avoid gatherings of more than 10. "We're grateful that so many churches, synagogues, and places of worship have continued to do that," Pence said. Some churches and religious locations have held gatherings larger than the recommended guidelines in recent days. Factcheck: rate of spread More on Trump's claim that the rate of the virus spread is slowing down across the country, "without exception". While the number of confirmed cases and hospital admissions have leveled off or dropped in some states including Louisiana, New York and New Jersey, the number of cases continues to increase in many states including Nebraska, Alabama, Kentucky, Texas and Arizona. Dr Jerome Adams, the US surgeon general, took the podium. He said that he helped lead a conference call with more than 400 hundred leaders in the African American community to discuss the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on the American minority community. He ticked off stats of where there is a larger number of African Americans or Hispanics who have the virus. "You've heard the stats in New York City, Hispanics represent the majority of deaths," Adams said, going on to say: "So what's going on? Well, it's alarming but it's not surprising that people of color have a higher burden of chronic health conditions." Adams explained that "the chronic burden of medical ills is likely to make people of color" more vulnerable "to the ravages". "We tell people to wash their hands, but as studies show, 30% of the homes in Navajao nation don't have running water," Adams said. Adams added: "But let me be crystal clear, we do not think people of color are biologically or socially prone to" [getting the disease]. Fact check: hospital admissions and death rate Trump claimed that the rate of the virus spread is slowing down across the country, "without exception" and that the death rate in the US was lower than anywhere else in the world. According to one source, the global death is 13 per million people. The US death rate is currently 54 per million, much higher than Germany at 31 per million, Portugal at 43 per million and 14 per million in Canada, but lower than Spain, France, Italy and the UK. A few minutes later Dr Deborah Birx said: "We have not reached the peak." Trump: the stock market thinks we've done well Trump said that the stock market's recent swings show that his administration is doing well in responding to the pandemic. "In four days, we had the biggest stock market increase that we had in 50 years. That tells you that there's a pent up demand. They want to get back," Trump said. "So think of it, in this horrible, dark period where this monster came and worked its horrible horrible spell over the world. Trump added: "We've done well and I guess the market thinks we've done well because had the biggest stock market increase" recently. Trump once again touted hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus cure. In the week beginning 30 March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an "emergency use authorization" to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. Clinical trials to test the drug's effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works. So far, the evidence that it's an effective cure for coronavirus is anecdotal and mixed. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration's obsession with the drug has since been discredited. The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it's unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. Fact check: death toll will be under 100,000 in the US Trump said his government's aggressive strategy had saved "countless lives and that great progress is being made". He claimed that the final death toll would be substantially under 100,000. Last week, the Whitehouse taskforce experts estimated the final death toll would likely be between 100,000 and 220,000 based on modelling. This week, the main model used lowered the estimated expected deaths toll by August to 60,400. But, Dr Anthony Fauci and others have warned that this depends on strict social distancing being implemented for months. The current death toll stands at 17,831. Trump ticked off a number of areas around the country that have seen welcome declines on the coronavirus pandemic. He said: "Detroit has really started to go up and now it is stabilizing." He said he spoke with Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, and that New Orleans and the state is less in need of hospital beds. And in Washington state Trump said: "We're making enough progress that the governor is able to return an army field hospital so we're going to take that hospital." Fact check: Mexican troops at the border wall Trump thanked president of Mexico, Andreés Manuel López Obrador for sending 27,000 troops to the Mexico-US border. Fact: in January Amlo announced that 15,000 military and national guard would be deployed to the northern border. About 6,500 others are deployed to Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. The coronavirus taskforce press conference has begun. Donald Trump is here again. He began his remarks recounting his conversation with Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador on oil. Then he pivoted to coronavirus. "Tremendous progress is being made. I just spoke with Governor Cuomo, we had a good talk," Trump said. He said the numbers of death are "horrible". "Now on the other side we have the number of beds being used, we were just saying are being substantially reduced." Trump added: "We're saving hundreds of lives compared to what it could have been." Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, urged caution even as some parts of New York hit hardest by coronavirus begin to recover. Via Reuters: The top US infectious disease expert warned on Friday that even though hard-hit spots like New York are showing positive results in the battle against coronavirus, it is too early to relax restrictions on Americans. The warning from Dr Anthony Fauci came as the Trump administration's top economic officials said on Thursday they believe the US economy could start to reopen for normal business in May, despite health experts' urging for continued social distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Donald Trump, seeking re-election on 3 November, wants to get the economy going as soon as possible. "Hopefully we're going to be opening up... very, very, very, very soon, I hope," he said on Thursday at the White House coronavirus briefing. Fauci, however, warned against relaxing restrictions too soon. "What we're seeing right now is favorable signs," Fauci said in an interview on CNN, citing progress in hard-hit New York. But he added, "the one thing you don't want to do is you don't want to get out there prematurely and then wind up back in the same situation". With many Americans celebrating the Easter holiday on Sunday, Fauci said it was important to keep social distancing measures in place. "Now is no time to back off," he said. "Obviously we're looking for the kinds of things that would indicate that we can go forward in a gradual way to essentially reopen the country to a more normal way," Fauci said, but that depends on a number of factors. House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi also warned Trump against trying to get back to normal prematurely. "I would hope that the scientific community would weigh in and say, 'You can't do this, it is only going to make matters worse if you go out too soon,'" Pelosi said in an interview with Politico late on Thursday. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has signed several new gun restrictions he championed during this year's legislative session, cementing gains by gun control advocates they hope will serve as a "blueprint" for states around the country. The Old Dominion has been the center of the nation's gun debate after Democrats took full control of the General Assembly last year on an aggressive gun control platform, The Associated Press writes. Tens of thousands of gun owners from around the country rallied against new gun restrictions at the state Capitol in January while lawmakers ultimately approved seven out of eight of Northam's gun-control package. The governor announced Friday he'd signed bills that include requiring universal background checks on gun purchases, a red flag bill to allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from people deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others, and limited handgun purchases to one a month. "This is an exciting day for me," Northam said on a conference call with gun-control advocates. Virginia was once a socially conservative state where lawmakers in both parties viewed gun rights as sacrosanct and the National Rifle Association held great sway. But as the state has grown more urban and suburban, the gun lobby's influence has waned. A mass shooting last year in Virginia Beach made gun control a front-burning issue in Virginia and heavy spending by groups backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg helped Democrats flip control of the legislature in November. Gun-control advocates said Friday they're planning to replicate their success in Virginia in other states. John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said his group plans to spend heavily in key battleground states this year like Arizona, North Carolina and Pennsylvania to elect lawmakers who support new gun restrictions. Feinblatt said polling shows a gun-control agenda is popular in those states and that Virginia is a "bellwether" of what's to come. The coronavirus faskforce press briefing has been moved back to 1.30pm. We'll be blogging it here. Stay tuned. Trump encourages prayer and healing this Easter even as some churches plan gatherings The president just spoke in the Oval Office to give an Easter blessing on Good Friday, where he was joined by Maryland Bishop Harry Jackson. Trump said, according to the pool report: "Our people are making tremendous sacrifices to end this pandemic. Though we will not be able to gather together with one another as we normally would on Easter, we can use this sacred time to focus on prayer, reflection and growing." He did not, however, make a point of putting out a message that churches should not be holding in-person services on Sunday. While many religious leaders plan to hold services remotely, there are plentiful reports of churches coast to coast planning to defy physical distancing orders or guidelines and encouraging congregations to attend, risking the further spread of the coronavirus. Trump also said: "Our brave doctors, nurses and responders, first responder, responders of all, are fighting to save lives, our workers are racing to deliver critical medical supplies. Our best scientists are working around the clock to develop life-saving therapeutics and I think they're doing really well in doing so." The president would like to see the US open back up sometime next month but economists think things could get worse. The Navajo Nation is increasing its efforts to slow down the coronavirus spread. New York governor Andrew Cuomo argued that the country needs to make an "unprecedented mobilization" of both private industry and the federal government to combat the coronavirus. A new CBS poll found Americans' view of how Trump is handling the pandemic continues to dip. The blog will be back soon. The daily Coronavirus Task Force press briefing is at 1 p.m. In capping off this press conference Cuomo addressed the disparities in coronavirus infections among African Americans and latinos. There have been multiple reports that the pandemic has disproportionally hit the American minority community. "I don't think there is a surprise that we have a disparity among the African American and Latino community," Cuomo said. He noted that systemic racism is an ongoing problem in the country and in New York. Cuomo also noted that the disparity isn't as bad in New York as other places in the country. "We are going to do more testing in African American and Latino communities." Asked about the state's stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, Cuomo sounded a calming note. "We're okay right now. We're okay. We have a stockpile where we are now relatively comfortable," Cuomo said. "Compared to how we are operating under these circumstances we are relatively comfortable on ventilators and PPE if." the hospitalization rate remains down. Cuomo is punting on Trump's repeated argument that the World Health Organization deserves some blame for the coronavirus pandemic's spread. "The president's point is the World Health Organization should've been more aggressive," Cuomo said. "This is not my field. I don't know." Trump has repeatedly criticized the WHO saying it is "China-centric." Trump, during a press conference on Tuesday, said first that he would put on hold funding to the WHO and then later said his administration would consider that. Cuomo: We are flattening the curve Throughout this conference Cuomo has stressed caution in moving forward even as New York sees incremental progress. "Is there going to be a second wave? Let's look at the countries that have gone through this process and what can we learn from them," Cuomo said. He pointed to Hong Kong: "Hong Kong recorded the biggest rise of cases and a new wave of infections. Is that true? Could it happen here? Article yesterday: Italy has seen a bump in a number of cases. Before we take this step we need to make sure we are more sure and more aware than we were in the past." But Cuomo added that New York is making progress. "So where do we go from here? First keep doing what we're doing. Stay home because that works. We are flattening the curve. We must continue flattening the curve," Cuomo said. "We need both diagnostic testing and anti-biotic testing and we need millions and millions of them and we need them in a matter of weeks, not months." He also said "we need to be more prepared as a nation." "I don't want a second wave, I don't want a third wave, I want this to be it." Cuomo in this press conference is offering some of his most direct arguments he's ever made on testing and whether the private sector can carry most of the burden in providing tests and help to the public on the coronavirus. He thinks it cannot. "We need an unprecedented mobilization where government can produce these tests in the millions. New York state is doing several thousand. We need 9 million people to get back to work," Cuomo said. "Private sector on their own I don't believe will be able to come to scale." Cuomo added "you're going to need government intervention to make that happen and the federal government is in the best position to do that." The New York governor also took aim at the stimulus bills Congress has passed to help businesses weather the crisis. "They've passed a couple already. Bu you need a fair federal stimulus bill that is not a federal pork barrel bill," Cuomo said. "I understand the dynamics of the US senate but this is not a time to be passing bills to make sure your home state gets enough funding. That's not what this is about. This is about helping your state come back." Cuomo urges Trump administration to set up a "heroes compensation fund". Just now Cuomo urged the Trump administration to set up a "heroes compensation fund" to help those working on the front lines of the coronavirus crisis. He added that "saying thanks is nice. Actually providing assistance is even better." Cuomo went on to say that the return to normalcy will be a gradual process. It won't be an immediate thing. That's in contrast to the hopes of Trump who has privately signaled to his colleagues that he would like things to start returning to normal by next month. "The key to reopening is going to be testing," Cuomo said. "It's not going to be a light switch like you flip the economy like a light switch. It's going to be a gradual phased process and it's going to be reliant on testing." Cuomo stared his Friday presser with some mild optimism. He said that "we are cautiously optimistic that we are slowing the infection rate." Cuomo went on to say that "ICU admissions is actually a negative number for the first time since we started this journey." But he added that the change in intibations "is a little tick higher than it's been in the past few days. The three day average is also down. The bad news is we continue to lose a tremendous number of lives and endure great pain as a state -775 lives lost." He then noted a comparison to September 11th and that the lives lost "should exceed 9/11 is beyond my capacity to understand." Without evidence the president has repeatedly charged voting by mail would dilute the election process and open voting up to rampant fraud. The Associated Press reports: President Donald Trump is warning without evidence that expanding mail-in voting will increase voter fraud. But several GOP state officials are forging ahead to do just that, undermining one of Trumps arguments about how elections should be conducted amid the coronavirus outbreak. While Trump has complained that voting by mail was ripe for fraud," Republican state officials in Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia have all taken steps to ease access to mail-in ballots, following health officials warnings that voting in person can risk transmission of the deadly virus. The Republican governor of Nebraska urged voters to apply for absentee ballots. Florida's GOP chairman says the party will continue to run a robust vote-by-mail program. The disconnect between Trump and Republican state officials illustrates the abrupt, hard turn the president and his national political allies have taken on the issue. Before the coronavirus hit, many in the GOP had warmed to mail-in voting, agreeing that it can be conducted without fraud and even used to their political advantage. But Trump's hard line appears to be driven by his personal suspicions and concerns about his own reelection prospects. Statewide mail-in voting doesnt work out well for Republicans," he tweeted this week. Trumps comments put his Republican allies in states in the awkward position of trying to defend their practices without criticizing the president. Some said they agreed with Trump, even as their actions seem to suggest otherwise. Others suggested Trump was out of line. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily press conference live at 11:30 ET. I will be liveblogging it. At 1 p.m. today Trump is holding his own daily press conference and I'll be liveblogging that one as well. Stay tuned. A growing set of Republicans are urging Trump to cool it on the daily press conferences. They're arguing that a lighter touch would benefit the president more. There's Nikki Haley, the former Trump administration ambassador to the United Nations and a potential 2024 presidential candidate, who said Trump should let "his experts speak." In an interview on Fox &amp; Friends Haley praised Trump's ability to "over-communicate." "I think he should go and set the tone. I think he should let them put out the data. I think they should answer any questions that the press has. And then they should leave," Haley said. "I don't think they need to be too long. I don't think he needs to feel like he needs to answer everything." Trump's advisers are also beginning to worry about the ripple effect of Trump's long daily press conferences. It sometimes "drowns out his message," South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham told the New York Times. He's urged Trump to cut down to a once-a-week presser. Trump, it should be noted, enjoys doing the press conferences. Donald Trump's reelection campaign included an image of former Obama administration ambassador to China Gary Locke in a new attack ad. Locke, a former two-term governor of Washington, is a third generation Chinese-American who was born in Seattle. The subject of the attack ad is Joe Biden and China. The use of Locke's image implies that he is some kind of Chinese official. According to The New York Times (bolds mine): The image, which appears briefly, was pulled from a 2013 event in Beijing, where Mr. Biden, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, shared a stage with Gary Locke, the former governor of Washington, who also served as President Barack Obama's commerce secretary and ambassador to China. Mr. Locke is Chinese-American. "During America's crisis, Biden protected China's feelings," the online ad says, presenting a montage of clips of Mr. Biden complimenting and praising the Chinese, including the country's leader, Xi Jinping, and of a news segment accusing Mr. Biden of helping his son Hunter profit off Chinese investments. The picture of Mr. Biden and Mr. Locke is spliced in among the clips. Steve Guest, the rapid response director for the Republican National Committee tweeted that Locke is not the point of the ad. Guest was responding to a tweet from Biden campaign spokesman T.J. Ducklo: Similarly, the Trump reelection team's communications director said the reason the image was included in the ad was the Chinese flag behind Biden and Locke. In a rare appearance in front of a group of mayors former President Barack Obama urged them to use experts and speak truth when publicly discussing the coronavirus pandemic. Here's the CNN report (bolds are from me): Former President Barack Obama on Thursday gave some advice to a group of mayors on how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, saying that "the biggest mistake any (of) us can make in these situations is to misinform." Obama was speaking during a virtual meeting organized by Bloomberg Philanthropies."Speak the truth. Speak it clearly. Speak it with compassion. Speak it with empathy for what folks are going through," Obama said, according to a press release on the virtual meeting.Obama also pushed the mayors to bring in as many smart advisers and experts as possible. "The more smart people you have around you, and the less embarrassed you are to ask questions, the better your response is going to be," Obama said. This is the fourth virtual meeting Bloomberg's group has held with mayors. Two of the previous meetings have featured speeches by former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Obama has repeatedly weighed in on the response to the virus, largely offering a more cautious message than that of President Donald Trump and advocating for protecting public health over re-starting economic activity. And Obama also urged the mayors to pay special attention to the most vulnerable. Here's his remark according to a press release from Bloomberg Philanthropies: "We're seeing disparities in how people are affected in cities and towns and communities across the country. Look out for the vulnerable. When you start looking at issues of domestic abuse and you start looking at racial disparities that are popping up in your cities, paying attention to that is the kind of leadership I know all of you aspire to. You have to be intentional about it, and dedicate folks to thinking about those issues." Here's a sign of the times: There's been an ongoing concern about how Capitol Hill lawmakers can legislate amid the coronavirus. In an interview with Politico, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled the chamber is unlikely to return later this month (bolds mine): Speaker Nancy Pelosi signaled Thursday that the House is unlikely to return to session later this month, her clearest indication yet that Congress - like the rest of the country - could remain shuttered for weeks or even longer as the coronavirus crisis continues. In a half-hour interview, Pelosi issued a stark warning to President Donald Trump, urging him not to prematurely rush to reopen major segments of the country before the coronavirus is under control, which she said could further send the U.S. economy into a tailspin. "Nobody can really tell you that and I would never venture a guess. I certainly don't think we should do it sooner than we should," Pelosi said when asked if she still planned to bring the House back on April 20, which is the current target date. "This has taken an acceleration from when we started this...Little did we know then that at this point, we'd be further confined." Navajo Nation steps-up strict measures to slow down the coronavirus spread The Navajo Nation is gearing up for a 57-hour curfew which comes into effect at 8pm tonight, and will continue until 5am on Monday. The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. On Thursday, Navajo president Jonathan Nez and vice-president Myron Lizer, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. "This is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure," said Nez during an online town hall meeting. The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won't see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork. Nez told Arizona news outlet ABC15: "To know that those dollars allocated and signed into law are supposed to go to all US citizens, but yet the first citizens of this country are being ignored by Washington." A new CBS poll finds Americans' views on Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic is dipping again. According to the poll: Views on President Trump's handling of the outbreak response have ticked down for the second consecutive week. The president is seen doing a good job by 47%, down four points from 51% last week and 53% the prior week. Now is the first time more say he's doing a bad job than a good one. The president gets comparably better marks on his handling of the economic impact of the outbreak, specifically, with 51% saying he's doing a good job. Good morning, readers. Donald Trump wants to reopen the country next month despite concerns from both economists and health experts that the coronavirus pandemic is nowhere near over. Trump, according to a Washington Post report, wants to restart business by 1 May. He's worried about how the volatile stock market and unemployment numbers will reflect his chances for reelection. Publicly, Trump seems to have the backing of some of his top aides. In an interview on CNBC on Thursday, treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said "I do" when asked if he thought the country could reopen in about a month. But health experts worry that reopening the government prematurely could dramatically reverse some of the progress the country has made in fighting the virus. Trump's concerns about a struggling economy are likely to only get worse. Economists are expecting the United States to "suffer its largest-ever contraction this quarter and the unemployment rate to soar to a post-Depression record, followed by a recovery that will be moderate and drawn out" according to Bloomberg News.53757falsefalseLois Beckett (now) and Daniel Strauss (earlier)Donald Trump speaks during a coronavirus taskforce briefing at the White House on 10 April.

      <title>Saturday Review: Profile: Jacqueline Wilson: The pied piper of Kingston: The most borrowed author in UK libraries, she has written almost 70 books for children. She began writing for teenage magazines and her success as a novelist has been built on often harrowing tales of girls surviving family breakdown and bullying, written with humour and telling detail</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The day Jacqueline Wilson hit the Hay-on-Wye literary festival last year, every child in the country seemed to know. With an hour to go, several hundred of them were fidgeting in a queue that wound through the small Welsh border town as far as the eye could see. Their eyes were shining, their rucksacks stuffed with the brightly coloured books that have become Wilson's trademark.</p>
      <p>The children, predominantly girls aged between eight and 14, filed in neatly enough; there was barely a sound as their small, steel-haired heroine took the stage and, with no props, no histrionics, began to tell them about her work. A forest of hands rose at question time; polite, informed questions ranged from "Why aren't your main characters boys?" to "Why don't you use a washing-machine?".</p>
      <p>But five minutes before she was due to stop, the mood changed. There was a wriggling and a giggling and, quite suddenly, half the audience had gone. Like the enchanted children of Hamelin, they were streaming out of the marquee, across a main road and into the signing tent. It took most of Hay's police to halt the traffic and see the children safely across, and two burly bouncers with walkie-talkies to hustle Wilson over the road to join them. She had warned the organisers in advance that she only had four hours to spare for signing books.</p>
      <p>To adult browsers in the festival bookshop it was a bemusing experience to see this slip of a woman - she has described herself as Granny Spice, but looks more like a gothic fairy godmother - being given a rock-star welcome. But Jacqueline Wil son is quite used to it. The longest signing she can remember was seven and a half hours in Stockport, and her hands bear the scars of this self-inflicted punishment. While her face is fresh and smiley, her fingers are gnarled and knobbled, with a particularly large signing lump on her right index finger. Nobody ever sees them, though, because they are concealed beneath an armoury of flamboyant silver rings to which she treats herself each time she finishes a novel. It seems a nice Wilson touch that they come from a shop called The Great Frog, frequented by rockers of a certain vintage ("Keith Richards gets his skull rings there").</p>
      <p>Jewellery and book-collecting are the only obvious indulgences of a self-confessed technophobe who, only now, after 35 years, is Wilson contemplating moving from her cramped Kingston-on-Thames house. She swims every morning at the local baths, though she could afford the swankiest gym. She has written more than 70 novels, nearly all of them for children. Last year her sales passed the 10 million mark, and this week it was announced that she had toppled Catherine Cookson from pole position as the most borrowed author in UK libraries.</p>
      <p>But her celebrity is very different to that of other stars of the children's books firmament, such as JK Rowling or Philip Pullman, because however much she is revered by the tweenies who read her, the nature of her writing means she is virtually unknown beyond them. "Girls adore her books. She legitimises all their feelings - especially their bad feelings about their friends and their families - without ever moralising. She is always on their side and they hoover up the books. Then, quite suddenly, they grow out of them and seem almost embarrassed at having enjoyed them so much. It's as if she's a part of their childhood which, sadly, they feel they must discard to appear sophisticated - partly because she is not rated by adults," says Guardian children's books editor Julia Eccleshare.</p>
      <p>She writes cosy stories for children as young as seven or eight, and much darker books for older readers. No fate is too terrible to be inflicted upon a Wilson character - they may be homeless or bullied or beaten up by wicked stepfathers. Their friends die; but possibly the worst fates are reserved for their mothers, who break down, develop cancer, commit suicide or simply abandon their children. All of this is delivered in the sunniest of styles, full of humour and quirky detail and underpinned by the serene conviction that children are smart and can survive anything.</p>
      <p>Wilson has been writing all her adult life, but the novella that made her name was The Story of Tracy Beaker , published in 1991, and now into its third television series, with a feature film to come on BBC1 on February 22. It is the diary of a feisty, occasionally violent 10-year-old who has spent most of her childhood in children's homes because of her mother's "monster gorilla" boyfriends. Like all Wilson's novels, it is told in the first person and is unblenching in its handling of emotions such as loneliness, jealousy and sheer rage. Gina Pollinger, her agent at the time, says: "It was a wonderful and totally extraordinary book. I think she really took a significant step into what hitherto had been considered not quite nice in children's literature. Issues like divorce had come into books before but they tended to be hefty novels. This read like lightning and she just went to the heart of it."</p>
      <p>Part of the breakthrough of Tracy Beaker was that it teamed Wilson up for the first time with the illustrator Nick Sharratt, who has played an important role in defining a "look" for all her subsequent novels, be they comfortable sleepover stories for younger children or tales of older girls coping with the dysfunctions of the adult world. Sharratt shares Wilson's flair for being childlike without being childish. "It was a very nice opportunity because, being written in the first person singular, I felt that the illustrations should be done by the person telling the story, and that gave me the opportunity to draw in the spirit of a 10-year-old," he says. In a simple ink line, he drew Tracy persecuting her friends, Tracy being tormented by devils, Tracy fantasising about home or holidays.</p>
      <p>As an adult, Sharratt found the detail in Wilson's writing touched the child in him - in Bad Girls (1996), for instance, bullied Mandy has a collection of felt-tip pens and finds an escape from her problems in drawing. "It's just the sort of thing I would have done as a child."</p>
      <p>It is partly this materiality, this accuracy of recollection that bonds Wilson to her readers and raises her above the ranks of "issue" writers. It is not, therefore, a surprise to find that she has an astonishingly detailed recall of her own early life. She was born in 1945 to Harry Albert Aitken, a draughtsman-turned-civil servant, and Margaret, who started as a book-keeper and found her vocation in middle age selling antiques. In the early years of their marriage, they found themselves homeless, like many young couples in bombed-out London, and moved between their parents' houses in Kingston and cramped rented lodgings. Jacqueline's space was defined by a rug in the corner of their bedroom. Then, when she was six, they were allotted a council flat. "It was the first time I'd had my own bedroom and we had central heating and constant hot water. Although nowadays people are sniffy about council flats, it was huge luxury and comfort for us," says Wilson. In her novels, a well-appointed council flat is often the Shangri-La of which her characters dream while coping with the horrors of bed-and-breakfast hostels or children's homes.</p>
      <p>Wilson's early childhood was solitary, though not - she insists - lonely. There wasn't much money to spare, but her mother's flair for antiques was already evident in her eye for a decent doll. "For a child of that time and background I did well for toys. At a very young age I loved paper dolls and books and crayons and papers. I was very much an indoor child," says Wilson.</p>
      <p>She went to primary schools in Lewisham and Kingston, with which she keeps in touch as a visiting author, and then on to Coombe Girls' School in New Malden, which has a Wilson teaching group alongside others for Austen and CS Lewis. Though she is quite probably the school's most distinguished old girl, when she was young her ambitions were not pitched high. At primary school she wanted to be a hairdresser; at secondary she raised her sights to window dresser, on the assumption that she would never be able to write for a living.</p>
      <p>On her first day at secondary school she met Chris Wiltshire, who remains her closest woman friend. Wiltshire recalls: "My first memory was of Jack sitting behind me in our reception class and, when we were told to go to a particular classroom for a lesson, she tapped me on the shoulder and said 'Shall we go together'?"</p>
      <p>Friendship is a constant, redeeming presence in Wilson's novels - it can be twee, passionate and conflicted, often at the same time. There is an ardour in the way her characters relate to each other that can make adults squirm while lighting up pre-teenage girls with recognition. As Ellie, the 13-year-old who narrates Girls in Tears (2002), says, after finding her best friend snogging her boyfriend: "I hate Nadine, I hate Magda even more. I never want to be friends with them again And yet under all this I love Nadine, I even love Magda, and I want to be their friend for ever and ever."</p>
      <p>From the way they talk, it seems this is just the sort of bond Wilson formed with Wiltshire. They remember sleep-overs at each other's homes and going on holiday together. "I used to love going round to Jack's flat for tea," says Wiltshire, "because her mum used to give us everything with chips, and cream cakes, and she always gave us a present with the meal - usually lovely books you could write in."</p>
      <p>As they got older, they would spend weekends wandering around London, shopping and going to jazz clubs. "Jack has never had very good eyesight and when we went to jazz concerts she would meet these boys and wouldn't have her glasses on, so when she had her first date with them I used to have to go on the bus with her and discreetly point her in the direction of the boy she was meeting, then go home by myself," recalls Wiltshire.</p>
      <p>Wilson is upbeat about her childhood, though there are clues that it wasn't en-tirely idyllic. Her parents weren't happy together and eventually parted. Her father was "quite frightening at times", while her passion for dressing in "witchy clothes" could be seen as a continuing rebellion against her mother's penchant for pastels.</p>
      <p>Neither Wilson nor Wiltshire much liked school, either, although Wilson was good at English and art. By 16, both decided they'd had enough and enrolled in secretarial courses at a local college. "I wasn't very good at shorthand and typing. In the early 60s it was so sexist, it was all about anticipating your boss's every need and buying Christmas cards and presents for his wife. That stuck in my throat and I began to panic a bit," says Wilson. Wiltshire persevered with it, but Wilson spotted a newspaper advertisement for teenage writers. "I thought, I'm a teenager and I wanted to be a writer, so I wrote off." The advertisement had been placed by DC Thomson, publisher of the Beano and the Dandy, which wanted to launch a teenage magazine. She frames her recollection in the plain, bare-bones syntax that characterises her novels: "They asked for a sample of writing and I thought about what I would like to read in a teenage magazine and decided I'd like some true-life articles about the embarrassment of being a teenager. So I wrote an article about going to a dance with your friends and they all get off with boys and you don't and you stand there tapping your foot and your mum asks if you had a good time and you say yes and then you go up to your bedroom and howl."</p>
      <p>The article was accepted and she was paid three guineas, which seemed a better deal than buying the boss's Christmas cards. Soon Thomson asked if she was interested in a job - the only problem being that she was 17 and lived in Kingston and the company was in Dundee. Undaunted by the thought of leaving home for the first time, she booked herself on to a night train to Scotland and set off to seek her fortune.</p>
      <p>When she got there, on a freezing November morning, she found that the company had placed her in a Church of Scotland hostel but had forgotten to confirm the booking. The result was that she spent her first three months as a wage- earning adult sleeping in a makeshift bed in a linen cupboard. Her customary cheerfulness came to the rescue. "It was actually the warmest place in this huge converted Victorian mansion."</p>
      <p>The magazine Thomson was on the point of starting needed a name: in a move that has become part of Jacqueline Wilson lore, they called it Jackie. "I was told they were naming it after me, but apparently the editor of Jackie recently said no, it was a team decision. And it's true that Jackie was very much a name of the 60s."</p>
      <p>She arrived in Dundee determined to be a single-minded career woman but within months had fallen in love with a young printer two years her senior. Millar Wilson was fed up with Scotland so they headed back south. Finding it impossible to get a job, he joined the police, while she did part-time jobs. They married when she was 19, and two years later their daughter Emma was born. "I remember my 21st birthday, in December 1966," she says. "I was seven months pregnant and Millar was on late turn. It wasn't very conventional, but what he did was give me a big cake with a picture of a book on it, and that cake kept us going right through to spring because we didn't have much money."</p>
      <p>By then she had written two or three novels but they had been turned down "and I really didn't have much gumption and assumed they were no good". Her first book to be accepted for publication was called Ricky's Birthday ( 1972 ).</p>
      <p>As a mother stuck at home with a small daughter, she would spend spare time in the local library, where she discovered a series of books written and edited by Leila Berg for Macmillan. The Nipper series threw out the mummy-daddy-and-dog format in favour of books that might appeal to inner-city kids: books with titles like Roddy's Newt and Fish and Chips for Supper . "I thought that's exactly the sort of thing I'd like to do. I added up the number of words and did it exactly the right size and I think (Berg) was probably quite tickled about this person coming absolutely out of the blue, so she bought it."</p>
      <p>When Macmillan pulled the plug on the Nipper series, Wilson made a brief foray into crime writing for adults. "Then," she says, "I got stuck, because when they found I was married to a policeman they thought I could write crime procedurals, but it was the one type of book I wasn't interested in." She didn't want to write about the police and she didn't want to be corralled into tight plots. It's a mark, perhaps, of her canniness as a writer, her ability to shape herself to a market, that she wrote four of them anyway. To her embarrassment they still lurk in the corners of libraries and are occasionally dragged out by an unwary librarian and thrust into the hands of a child. "They're very dark and have lots of sexual detail and are utterly unsuitable for children. But the interesting thing is, there are children in every one, so obviously I wanted to write for children most of all."</p>
      <p>In the early days she would write in whatever time she could liberate from looking after Emma, combining novel-writing with magazine stories. She found she could clear 2,000 words during a morning nursery session. "For years I not only had a novel on the go but did at least 10,000 words a week for magazines, because a policeman's wage used to be not very much at all and my money could be used for clothes and holidays and things."</p>
      <p>The picture she paints of a cottage industry with her daughter cooing in the background makes you wonder where the darkness comes from, the constant preoccupation with domestic dysfunction, and particularly with inadequate mothers. Both Wilson and her friends insist it has no reflection in her life. "We were quite a tightly knit family," says Emma, Wilson's only child, and "the light of Jack's life," according to Wiltshire. Because the age gap between Wilson and her daughter was relatively small, the "generations were blurred" and from an early stage they related to each other like sisters.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, though she is exceptionally close to Emma - now 36 and a lecturer in French and contemporary film at Corpus Christi, Cambridge - Wilson does not belong to the AA Milne school of writers who started out trying to amuse their own children. "I used to find conflict in children's books very hard to handle," says Emma. "I've always particularly loved Victorian or Edwardian stories - Little Women , E Nesbitt. She doesn't write for the type of child I was, although when I was a child she would write special stories for me and we'd make up stories around my dolls or soft toys."</p>
      <p>Combing her novels for insights, just one intriguing instance emerges of what could be construed as a bit of personal mischief. Six years ago, Wilson's husband left her for another woman. Millar was by then retired, having risen to the rank of chief superintendant. Two days after it happened she was doing a question-and-answer session with some children when one asked, "Has your marriage split up?" With impeccable composure she replied: "Funnily enough, yes." She tells this anecdote herself, in line with the authorised version of her life and her writing that nothing is so painful that it is beyond bounds, that it cannot somehow be contained with courage and a smile. But five years later, in Midnight (2003), her narrator, Violet, has an unsympathetic father who is in the police. "Dad could bore on for hours about being a policeman," Violet tells us in one of many diatribes. "His battles with chief idiots at Area Headquarters and his Neighbourhood Watch meetings with loonies obsessed with dog muck kept him burbling on all the way round the garden and half the way home."</p>
      <p>Wilson admits that writing in the first person is a licence for bad behaviour, though she insists that such behaviour is not hers. "I think you get a raw response to things if you see them from a child's point of view," she says. "If you write in the third person and you have a child being very silly or very rude, it's hard to prevent oneself as an author coming into it."</p>
      <p>Yet the paradox of her writing is that it is so deeply felt, even if on other people's behalf. In Vicky Angel (2000), for instance, a 10-year-old is run over and killed in front of her best friend, then returns to haunt her in what becomes a deeply affecting portrait of bereavement. The spectral Vicky is not nice at all, but a jealous bully who isolates her friend, Jade, from her schoolfriends and even, at one point, nearly kills her. "I wanted to show that grieving is horrible and uncomfortable and goes on for a long time," says Wilson. "Weirdly and very touchingly quite a few people have said that they found it quite helpful."</p>
      <p>Emma believes the key to her mother's writing is her determination to be honest. "I remember, if difficult things happened, she always wanted to see them and respond to them absolutely justly and would get angry if a child's experience was overlooked or neglected. Realism and justice are very deep within mum."</p>
      <p>Pollinger feels courage is also an important element. "She has held fast to the conviction that you really can confront children in fiction with the harsh realities with which they are confronted in real life." In her Girls. . . series for older readers, that reality includes snogging, getting paralytically drunk and internet dating with a paedophile.</p>
      <p>The environments in which her children live are always portrayed in precise detail, against the prevailing wisdom of the children's book market, which encourages authors to be as bland and timeless as possible to maximise their sales outlets.</p>
      <p>There is no question that it works with her readers, for whom she loyally supplies two books a year, one for younger and one for older readers. Primary school consultant Philippa Harvey points out the educational value of this strategy. "It means that children who are struggling with reading can belong to her club, even though the younger books don't tackle the same issues. Then they carry on until they're 13 or 14." Harvey, whose daughter is a Wilson fan, admits to vetting the books before handing them over. "Particularly when she was at primary school I thought there were some bits that were unsuitable for her age."</p>
      <p>Perhaps because of her subject matter, but also because of the very predictability that fans of her novels so love, she meets some resistance from adults. It is inconceivable that she would win the Whitbread book of the year, like Pullman or Mark Haddon. And although she has won several prizes, including the Guardian children's fiction award, she has not yet been awarded the oldest and most distinguished children's prize, the Carnegie medal, which is decided by librarians. Her supporters feel she should have won it with The Illustrated Mum (1999), but Anne Marley, head of Hampshire children's libraries and chair of the Carnegie last year, argues that it would be wrong to read any significance into her absence from the prize-winners' roster. "It depends what books she's up against."</p>
      <p>Compared with some of her peers, very little has been written about Wilson's work, although that is changing, according to Pat Pinsent, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Children's Literature, based at the University of Surrey, Roehampton. "Though her books seem simple, their construction is very sophisticated, so in a kind of way she familiarises young readers with post-modernist conventions. At the same time her colloquial style allows children to take ownership of the voice." Several of her novels are written as children's diaries, for instance, with poignantly unreliable narrators.</p>
      <p>Among her peers, there are no doubts about her worth. Pullman, author of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says: "Her appeal is extraordinary, and I think it's due to the fact that she writes directly - never down : she taps into something that young girls especially, but certainly boys too, recognise as being distinctively like themselves. She is very hard-working and very consistent; but the other interesting thing about her is that without moving away from her audience, she seems to be getting deeper and darker."</p>
      <p>Pullman also admires her apparently boundless energy in visiting schools, signing books and answering fan letters by hand. "I've been telling her for years to stop doing everything people ask her to. But she's so good-natured that she won't listen to me. I admire all that industry immensely, but I do wonder sometimes if she'd write even better books if she held back on the public appearances a bit. Maybe it gives her something she needs."</p>
      <p>There was a touching moment at the Hay festival when someone asked if she would ever retire. "If I feel I'm repeating myself," she replied. "But right now, at an age when many women are being written off as little old ladies, I'm really enjoying being spoiled."</p>

      <title>travel: India special: Where the grass is greener: The key to a happy holiday in India is planning. In this issue, we set out the options, starting with Stephen Moss in Kerala, where Indians go to get away from it all</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The bookshop in Cochin's shiny new airport captures the contradictions of Kerala: the latest Michael Crichton, manuals on Ayurvedic massage, paeans to this green and beautiful state, copies of the Communist Manifesto, the collected apercus of Fidel Castro. As with India, so with Kerala: the only safe generalisation is that all generalisations are wrong.</p>
      <p>A recent survey found that Kerala was the state Indians elsewhere in the country most wanted to visit - and in increasing numbers they do. Indian visitors outnumber foreigners two to one, which means that, unlike at the palaces and religious sites of northern India, the place isn't overrun by coachloads of tourists doing the subcontinent in 17 days.</p>
      <p>Kerala is far more relaxed than the tourist traps of northern India. Wealthy Bombayites come here to escape from the rat race; honeymoon couples hire houseboats and drift lazily down the state's numerous rivers; hawkers make perfunctory efforts to get you into their shops; sari salesmen don't rip you off; "sights" are few, so you can't go temple-hopping; most of the hotels can't afford the state's liquor licence, so you can't get drunk (but beware the coconut-based toddy); and if you want to go one step further with detoxification, there are plenty of Ayurvedic healers offering massage, herbal remedies and a home-spun philosophy based on clean living.</p>
      <p>Many wealthy westerners and the even richer visitors from the Gulf states come to get de-stressed in high-class hotels on the coast or inland. Some tourists supposedly never leave the confines of the hotel, commuting between poolside and massage table. Sun is more or less guaranteed from November until April, but temperatures are more bearable than on India's eastern coast. The pool is inviting - but the idea of flying 4,000 miles just to get a tan is crazy.</p>
      <p>The political tracts which greet you at Cochin airport reflect the state's politics. Kerala has a strong communist party - it had the world's first democratically-elected communist government, though a Congress Party-led coalition won the elections in May - but it is far from unreconstructed. Keralans are fiercely independent and, despite the punitive liquor licences, entrepreneurs are mostly allowed to get on with it. Kerala has the highest literacy rate in India, thanks to the government's investment in education, and also the highest suicide rate in the country. The two are related: high literacy encourages ambitions which the underdevelopment of this largely agricultural state is unable to fulfil.</p>
      <p>Many visitors come for the beaches in the south of the state, especially at Varkala and Kovalam, though much of the coastline (the so-called "Costa del Kerala") has been overdeveloped. A more imaginative approach is to combine a beach holiday - Varkala is the best bet - with a tour of the rest of the state. Hotel groups such as the Taj chain offer packages that allow you to perm from six locations: a stay might combine Cochin's history, Varkala's beaches and Kumarakom's riverside restfulness.</p>
      <p>Cochin (or, in post-imperial guise, Kochi) is built around a huge natural harbour. Vasco da Gama landed here in 1498 and established the first European colony in India. The remnants of the Portuguese fort stand at the mouth of the harbour, next to huge 400-year-old fishing nets that are still used, though the catches are much reduced because of overfishing.</p>
      <p>Da Gama is buried in St Francis church, which was built in 1510 and is the oldest Christian church in India. A monument to local men killed in the first world war stands outside the church, and, inside, the collecting box dedicated to Bunny D'Cruz testifies to the community's mixed origins. The Portuguese were driven out by the Dutch, who, in turn, were displaced by the British. The church itself has been through several incarnations, with the puritanical Dutch ripping out the trappings of Portuguese Catholicism to leave an austere, bare-walled interior.</p>
      <p>The secret of Kerala's remarkable religious tolerance lies in the numerical balance between the groups - there are large Hindu, Muslim and Christian populations - with no one community able to dominate or oppress the others. Temples and mosques are numerous, but small scale. The main temple in Cochin is closed to non-Hindus, but we were allowed to take lunch with the Brahmin (a descendant of the founder of the temple) and his 20-strong extended family in the adjoining house, a once-grand residence now fallen on hard times because of land reform.</p>
      <p>We were greeted at the entrance by an elephant in a red head-dress and the extremely loud temple band, and were covered in garlands and given a coconut to drink. Lunch was a selection of curries and pourris eaten off banana leaves. The whole family eats together, men and children first, sitting on the floor and eating with their hands - the rice was tricky and we resorted to spoons.</p>
      <p>The old quarter of Cochin is called, non-pejoratively, Jewtown. The synagogue dates from 1568 and the fact that it abuts a Hindu temple shows the accom modation between the religions. But despite that tolerance, the long history of the Jews in Cochin is coming to an end. When Israel was founded after the second world war, most of the 2,000-strong community headed for the promised land. Only 14 Jews remain - old, frail, and keeping to themselves in homes close to the synagogue.</p>
      <p>Jewtown houses a very good antique market. It's not just tourist stuff either: buyers come from all over India. But you have to know what you are doing: shop owners are not above producing "antiques" by burying newly-manufactured artefacts in the sand to get that distressed, high-rupee look.</p>
      <p>The Hotel Malabar in Cochin enjoys a fabulous harbourside location and very relaxed atmosphere. One of its many pluses is that it will arrange transport to your next destination, in our case an hour-and-a-half speedboat trip south across Lake Vembanad, with the driver having to plot a course through floating plants and fishermen's nets. The speedboat zipping past fishing canoes that look much as they did a thousand years ago isn't a bad metaphor for modern India.</p>
      <p>We were heading for Kumarakom, inland but accessible, as is so much of Kerala, by the backwaters that are the lifeblood of the state. A long, slow boat trip along one of these rivers takes you past villages that occupy a narrow strip of land backing on to rice fields. Women are washing vegetables in the river, teenagers are riding bicycles and scooters along the riverbank, and small children call out for pens (any westerner or wealthy Indian is thought to be good for a Biro). It looks idyllic, but who knows: you can't help wondering about that suicide rate.</p>
      <p>Some of the hotels lay on traditional drama, dance and music. Generally, the heart sinks at the notion of local culture being packaged as evening entertainment for western consumption. But on the whole it worked, especially the kathakali we saw in Cochin. This form of storytelling combines dance, drama and religious mythology and is usually performed in all-night sessions in temples. True believers in the Rough Guide approach will want to see it in that setting, but watching the highlights package with a gin and tonic on a makeshift stage in a balmy hotel garden suited me fine: the artists had cleverly boiled down the all-nighter to 45 minutes of highly effective (and knowingly ironic) explanation and performance.</p>
      <p>From Kumarakom, we moved inland to Thekkady, a three-hour drive on largely traffic-free roads up into the hills. Thekkady's main attraction is the 777 square mile Periyar game reserve, at the centre of which lies a large man-made lake. Periyar is home to tigers and elephants, but visitors shouldn't build up their hopes. Even the ranger had only seen one of the 40-plus tigers, and our boat trip across the lake didn't produce any elephant sightings. We were, though, shown two houses near the shore which two days previously had been attacked and virtually destroyed by a rampaging elephant. (Nature note: puberty is difficult for elephants and they usually throw a wobbly between the ages of 15 and 20.)</p>
      <p>From Thekkady we went north to Munnar, a bustling town in the heart of Kerala's tea-growing estates. It is noticeably cooler here (the town stands at around 5,000ft) and the hilltops are shrouded in mist. The landscape is reminiscent of Scotland, and it was Scots who planted tea here in the 1870s and developed the vast plantations.</p>
      <p>They are now Indian-owned, but the legacy of the Raj is everywhere: two golf courses, a local club where the hat bar, billiards room and card tables are perfectly preserved, bacon and eggs for breakfast, sticky sponge puddings for tea. The estate managers' shoes were the most highly polished I have ever seen, their blazers and crisply pressed trousers immaculate. Old habits die hard: a corner of India that is forever Caterham, circa 1952. Munnar is the one part of Kerala that has never developed a taste for Marx.</p>

      <p>Clinton: keep guns 'out of hands of haters'</p>
      <p>Clinton takes a question about Black Lives Matter and fatal use of force by police officers.</p>
      <p>Clinton says that criminal justice reform has been a long-term focus. "We have to help protect innocent people in their communities.</p>
      <p>Somebody takes a life and they're wearing a uniform... then it has to be investigated, their actions have to be justified," or there should be consequences.</p>
      <p>Then Clinton keeps up an attack she's been regularly deploying on the stump, against the gun lobby.</p>
      <p>She calls for closing the "Charleston loophole," by which gun buyers can purchase weapons before background checks are complete. The perpetrator of the mass shooting at Emanuel AME "was able to get a gun he should not have gotten because the law permits him to get it after three days even though the check into his background was not complete," Clinton says.</p>
      <p>"And he pulled out that gun and he murdered nine of them.</p>
      <p>"We've got to do more to get guns out of the hands of the haters, of the mentally dangerously ill."</p>

      <p>Clinton: Powell and Rice used private email</p>
      <p>Clinton's moved to New England College in Henniker, New Hampshire, for a town hall with students - and we've moved with her. It's a 20-minute drive she seems to have made in 15. But she has a pretty large and serious entourage.</p>
      <p>Live from Henniker!</p>
      <p>She's struck an entirely different tone for the student crowd - pointed, aggressive, even displaying some degree of temper on the topic of her use of private emails as secretary of state.</p>
      <p>"Secretary Powell? Secretary Rice's closes aides? Used private email. Everybody knew that!" Clinton said, picking up on reports that both previous secretaries of state engaged in email hygiene as bad as her own.</p>

      <p>Albright's 'special place in hell': old line, new context</p>
      <p>Madeleine Albright closed her pitch in Concord for Hillary Clinton with the line, "Just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other!"</p>
      <p>It's a strong line - and it has been for years.</p>
      <p>enltrpeeps freaking out about that Madeleine Albright quote: It's not new -- it was literally on a Starbucks cup. pic.twitter.com/19v8zGPCtU</p>
      <p>- Jesse Lehrich (@JesseLehrich) February 6, 2016</p>
      <p>But the context, in this case, made the line land with particular force. After a section of her speech devoted to Clinton's talents as a stateswoman, Albright had turned more personal, saying it was time for a woman president.</p>
      <p>Then she addressed young women in the audience directly, falling into a lecture.</p>
      <p>"Young women have to support Hillary Clinton. The story is not over!" said Albright. "They're going to want to push us back. Appointments to the Supreme Court make all the difference!"</p>
      <p>The "going to hell" line drew a great cheer from the Concord crowd, but it may not play as well retrospectively, with a glance back of just six days, when Bernie Sanders overwhelmingly won young voters in Iowa - by a margin of 6-to-1, including young women.</p>
      <p>Did young women in Iowa see a path to immortal salvation that did not include voting for Hillary Clinton? Is Albright wrong - or are they?</p>

      <p>The city's residents have suffered toxic levels of lead in their water for more than 18 months, since state-appointed city managers began drawing water from the polluted Flint River as a cost-cutting measure. The campaign said in a statement that Clinton "will use her trip to urge the Republican-controlled Senate to approve the Senate Democrats' $600 million amendment to help Flint".</p>
      <p>Bernie Sanders has also highlighted the water crisis there, and called for Rick Snyder, the governor who dismissed concerns from residents for months, to resign.</p>

      <p>Tattoo parlors in Montpelier, Vermont, and Seabrook, New Hampshire, are inking the faces of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump onto people's bodies, delighting customers who want to show off and/or visibly regret their political choices.</p>
      <p>The Burlington Free Press reports that Aartistic Tattoo in Montpelier has had several dozen people get an outline of Sanders' unkempt hair and thick-rimmed glasses. Tattoo artist Chad Fay said the free tattoo promotion will run as long as Sanders does. Between him and coworker Jessica Andrew, the parlor's done 23 Sanders tattoos in the last week.</p>
      <p>In Seabrook, the artists of Clay Dragon Tattoo are drawing Trump and his slogan "Make America Great Again" on people for free. "Trump is the only one that's giving anybody any hope to do anything different in this country," owner Bob Holmes told Nhl.</p>
      <p>He added that he's never voted or been interested in politics.</p>
      <p>"You can't take life too seriously anyway, and if it's a Trump tattoo, and if he wins which, it's going to be hard pressed that he doesn't win because he's doing everything that no one else is doing," Holmes said. He's done one tattoo so far.</p>

      <p>Clinton tells the stories of a couple people she met while canvassing this morning in Manchester. The anecdotes culminate in a personal call from Clinton: "I want to take on the issues that are really tugging at people's lives."</p>
      <p>"A young man came up to me and said I'm supporting you because you have made addiction a central issue in your campaign," Clinton says. "I said, 'Do you have personal experience with this?'</p>
      <p>"He said yes."</p>
      <p>An athlete in high school, Clinton said, her new acquaintance got hurt and had surgery, afterwards becoming addicted to opiates. "I went to heroin because it was cheaper," he told her. "I got help and I've been off it for two years. But it's not easy. In this state particularly, it's an epidemic.</p>
      <p>"I want to take on the issues that are really tugging at people's lives," Clinton says.</p>

      <p>"This is the kind of thing that a president should also be worried about," Clinton says.</p>
      <p>Strong applause for that line.</p>
      <p>"When I talk about we will rise, I really mean it. We will rise, we will rise," she says, allowing a hint of plaintiveness in her voice.</p>

      <p>Albright's really lighting up the room. She closes with an even bigger applause line, with an allusion to the abortion rights fights:</p>
      <p>"Young women have to support Hillary Clinton. The story is not over!" says Albright. "They're going to want to push us back. Appointments to the Supreme Court make all the difference.</p>
      <p>"It's not done and you have to help. Hillary Clinton will always be there for you. And just remember, there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other!"</p>

      <p>With four days until New Hampshire's presidential primary, the state's infamously late-deciding voters face a choice between Donald Trump and a five-car pile-up.</p>
      <p>On the one end is Trump, the frontrunner who through bombast and showmanship has dominated the polls for months. On the other, a group of candidates vying to salvage the establishment's standing in a race marked by frustration with Washington and the upper echelons of the Republican party.</p>
      <p>Each contender brought a distinct style to the campaign trail this week, seeking to close in on voters who could still be swayed ahead of a contest that will drastically reset the race for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>

      <p>The Concord crowd (and your blogger) is/are waiting for Hillary Clinton to take the stage. Meantime the Guardian's Lauren Gambino has spoken with Olivia Schribert, who came to the Concord event with her high school class from Mamaroneck, New York.</p>
      <p>Schribert says her classmates are spread out across the state at various Bernie Sanders and Marco Rubio events.</p>
      <p>Schribert, who will turn 18 before November, said she hopes the first vote she casts is for the first woman president of the United States.</p>
      <p>Many of her friends are divided over who they support, and she says she "gets the appeal" of Sanders, who polls show is leading with young people.</p>
      <p>In a play for a piece of Sanders' young fan base, Clinton has advanced the argument in recent days that pragmatism, not passion, gets results. (She once told actress Lena Dunham in an interview: "if you can't get excited, be pragmatic.")</p>
      <p>Clinton had found a disciple in Schribert - who, unfortunately for Clinton, is not a New Hampshire voter.</p>
      <p>"I think Bernie's ideas are really good but I think Hillary has a better chance of getting things passed," Schribert said.</p>

      <p>Is Clinton contesting New Hampshire ? An LA Times piece this morning asserts she is not. Bill Clinton, whose 1992 candidacy sparked here, is campaigning in Nevada, which caucuses later this month, instead of in the Granite State. Real Clear Politics polling averages have Bernie Sanders up 16.7 points in New Hampshire, just three days before the primary.</p>

      <p>So "she isn't working the state the way she did in 2008 when she pulled off an upset victory," report Evan Halper and Michael Memoli in the Times:</p>
      <p>While Clinton continued to express hope that a victory is possible in this state, where voters are prone to wild shifts in opinion up until election day, she isn't working the state the way she did in 2008 when she pulled off an upset victory. By Friday, former President Bill Clinton had already been dispatched to Las Vegas to headline events aimed at organizing voters to turn out for the Nevada caucuses, which are taking on increased importance as a must-win firewall for his wife. The campaign released its first Spanish-language ads Friday, which it will start airing in Nevada.</p>
      <p>But Clinton's rally in Concord this morning, and her events schedule of two get-out-the-vote's and a town hall on Saturday, feel nothing like a concession. Clinton will be in Henniker this afternoon and in Portsmouth this evening. Traveling with her are the natural duo of Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of state, and Cory Booker, the US senator from New Jersey</p>

      <p>Surely aware that Tuesday's vote will be his last stand - his last chance to have an impact on this race - Chris Christie is going negative to make his mark, writes Jonathan Freedland in Bedford, NH.</p>
      <p>The New Jersey governor's stump speech delivered just now in Bedford consisted of a barely-veiled attack on Marco Rubio - the man he clearly deems his biggest rival for the support of relatively moderate Republicans.</p>
      <p>Without mentioning Rubio by name, he mocked the role of "first term US senators", arguing that they lack the executive experience essential for the role of the presidency - experience that governors like him have in spades.</p>
      <p>"The presidency is not a place for on the job training", Christie said, adding there was "no owner's manual" left in the drawer of the desk of the Oval Office.</p>
      <p>Implicitly comparing Rubio to Barack Obama, he said the presidency should not be "handed to someone who can read a teleprompter better than anyone else." He went on to liken the life of a US senator to that of a child at grade school - devoid of any real responsibility.</p>
      <p>All that was missing was a repeat of the description Christie offered earlier this week of Rubio as "the boy in the bubble" , unable to function outside the comfort zone of scripted remarks.</p>
      <p>Playing to the stereotype of the pugnacious New Jersey pol, Christie promised he "would leave nothing behind" during the hand to hand combat of tonight's TV debate of Republican candidates.</p>
      <p>But he couldn't go without delivering a couple of swipes at Donald Trump too. "This job cannot go to an entertainer in chief. We need a commander in chief."</p>
      <p>"Showtime is over," he said. "It's game time. It's time to pick a president."</p>

      <p>Bernie Sanders is speaking at Franklin Pierce University in southern New Hampshire, a school named after our 14th and perhaps most obscure president. A large crowd of young people have gathered to hear him speak.</p>
      <p>He's doing his stump speech standards - the price gouging and chaos of the American healthcare system, the broken criminal justice system, etc. He's speaking about climate change at the moment, saying it'll cause more floods, drought, international conflict.</p>
      <p>Sanders. Photograph: John Minchillo/AP</p>
      <p>"What we're doing to the oceans already is tragic," he says. We don't have a single Republican candidate who's willing to stand up on the issue, he adds, because of the contributions they receive from the Koch brothers and other fossil fuel interests.</p>
      <p>Somebody shouts: "We have you!"</p>
      <p>Sanders gets into his riff on Wall Street, whose executives spent "billions of dollars [on lobbying] to say we want to get the government off our backs".</p>
      <p>After they got the government off of their backs, it turned out that their operations were basically fraudulent. That they were selling subprime mortgage practices that were worthless. That Wall Street teetered on the edge of collapse. You and your parents bailed them out.</p>
      <p>He notes that two Goldman Sachs executives have become secretaries of the Treasury under Republican and Democratic candidates, and that dozens of executives have gone "in government and do the bidding of Wall Street".</p>
      <p>But he comes around to say that he wants to even the teams, and get the people represented properly in Washington again. He's getting angry.</p>
      <p>He takes off his jacket and the crowd goes wild.</p>
      <p>"I feel like a rock and roll star," he laughs. "Nothing more is coming off, that's it."</p>
      <p>"Don't accept reality just because it's out there," he urges the crowd. "Ask why. When you see somebody homeless sleeping out in the street, don't accept that as normal. It is not normal."</p>

      <p>Hillary Clinton has not struggled to find income in the years since she left the White House and State Department. Edward Helmore reports on the finances of the former secretary of state.</p>
      <p>Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $153m from paid speeches over the last 15 years, a CNN study has found, including at least $7.7m from 39 speeches to Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Bank of America.</p>
      <p>The study found that between 2001 and the formal announcement of Hillary Clinton's campaign last May, the couple gave 729 speeches at an average of $210,795 each. Hillary Clinton, who is facing campaign-trail scrutiny over her ties to Wall Street, earned more than $1.8m for at least eight speeches to large financial institutions, the study found.</p>
      <p>Claims by Bernie Sanders that Clinton is an establishment politician who "throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests" provoked a sharp response during this week's debate, when Clinton accused the Vermont senator of attacking her "by innuendo, by insinuation".</p>
      <p>"You will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation I ever received," Clinton said.</p>
      <p>Her campaign has said it is considering releasing the text of speeches she gave to Wall Street firms.</p>
      <p>Related: Clinton puts Sanders on the defensive in heated Democrat debate</p>
      <p>According to CNN, Bill Clinton made the majority of the speeches, 637, earning $132m; his wife earned more than $21m from 92 speeches.</p>
      <p>In 2013, the study found, Hillary Clinton made $775,000 from three speeches to Goldman Sachs and $225,000 each from UBS, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.</p>
      <p>The analysis show a steady increase in the couple's billing. In 2004, Bill Clinton was charging $125,000 per engagement. In 2014, for a speech to Bank of America/Merrill Lynch in London, his fee was $500,000.</p>
      <p>Hillary Clinton hit the big bank speaking circuit in 2013, after leaving the State Department. She spoke then at $225,000 per engagement. In 2014, her fee was $260,000 - a 15% rise.</p>

      <p>Clinton has raised eyebrows as of late for her sharp attacks against the only man standing between her mother and the Democratic nomination: Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. But on the campaign trail in Minnesota this week, however, a slip of the tongue accidentally paid him a compliment.</p>
      <p>Criticizing Sanders for his vote on a bill granting legal immunity to the gun industry, Clinton referred to her mom's rival as "President Sanders".</p>

With Iowa settled ( more or less ) in a victory for Republican Ted Cruz and a de facto tie for Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, New Hampshire has become a high-stakes fight for every candidate in the field.</p>

Republicans Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Chris Christie have poured nearly all their time and money into New Hampshire in the hopes that its voters, more moderate than the evangelical base of Iowa, will turn the party away from the religious fervor of Cruz and "everything is terrible" rhetoric of Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>But polls put Trump on top by a healthy margin of more than 15 points, and Marco Rubio is nudging himself into position as the best-placed alternative to both the unpredictable billionaire and the much-loathed senator from Texas.</p>
      <p>Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Jim Gilmore are still there, too.</p>
      <p>Related: Happy Gilmore: on the trail - and at the gun range - with the unknown candidate</p>
      <p>Democrats also face what could be the first truly decisive vote in the 2016 election. Clinton beat Sanders in Iowa by a tiny margin, and caucus night was a chaotic, poorly managed affair. The race turned emotional and sharp on Thursday, in the first debate that pit the two candidates against each other.</p>
      <p>Despite her enormous campaign resources, her many allies and her healthy national lead in the polls, Clinton is something of an underdog in New Hampshire. Sanders has a 21-point lead there, according to averages, and is slowly approaching her poll numbers nationally. Democrats have found themselves divided along similar lines as Republicans (age, wealth, race and more), and while Clinton has racked up endorsements Sanders continues to surprise her, winning over a former head of the NAACP and turning out large numbers of young voters.</p>
      <p>So stick with us through the day for everything from the trail. From the trail, we've got DC bureau chief Dan Roberts, national affairs correspondent Tom McCarthy, national reporter Lauren Gambino, political reporters Ben Jacobs and Sabrina Siddiqui, and Adam Gabbatt, who just went shooting with the candidate that America forgot.</p>
      <p>There'll also be comment and analysis, eg: a look at Clinton from Jill Abramson.</p>

      <title>Law: Tell us the truth: Ten years ago, Tony Alliss was killed after a long feud with his neighbour. Was it murder, an accident or self-defence? A trial in 1991 acquitted those accused, but his family still want answers. Sally Weale reports</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Disputes between neighbours have become the stuff of light entertainment. Like quiz shows and hospitals, joy riders and vets, rows between people who live next door to each other are deemed perfect material for prime-time television.</p>
      <p>But such disputes can become deadly. On Wednesday it will be exactly 10 years since Tony Alliss, a father of four, was shot dead after a long dispute with neighbours over a boundary between their land. Two men, a father and son who lived next door, were accused of his murder but were acquitted after the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence.</p>
      <p>The Alliss family has been left feeling doubly aggrieved. As well as losing a husband at father at the age of 40, they believe that the legal system has failed them. The true facts of the case, they say, never came out at the original trial; they feel let down by the Crown Prosecution Service and their former solicitors. They have been striving for justice as they see it for 10 years and they will not rest until justice has been done.</p>
      <p>Having been let down by the criminal justice system, they are now bringing a civil action on behalf of Alliss's son, Leigh, who was also shot on the night his father died. They want to prove that the killing was unlawful and they are claiming aggravated damages for the physical injury Leigh suffered, the trauma of the incident itself and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>But it is not money the Allisses are after. They want what they say is the truth to come out, finally, in a court of law.</p>
      <p>In 1980 Tony Alliss bought a cottage near the village of King's Stanley in Gloucestershire, not far from where he had grown up as a child. Beechwood Cottage was beautifully situated on the south-west-facing lower slopes of the Cotswold hills. An existing kennels business was included in the deal.</p>
      <p>There was just one problem: although there was access on foot to the cottage, there was no access for cars - all vehicles had to be left on the side of the road and then there was an uphill walk across a field to the house. Early on, Alliss went to see his neighbour, Terence Maule, a retired merchant seaman, to ask if he would sell him a right of way across his land. Maule refused.</p>
      <p>Instead, Alliss, who had a smallholding and worked with heavy plant machinery, reached an agreement with the owners of an area of woodland, Penn Wood, next to his house. He would look after the day-to-day running of the forest, and in return could have the use of a track which ran through it to his cottage.</p>
      <p>The arrangement worked well. Then, in 1987, Alliss heard a whisper that the wood was going to be put on the market. He was worried it could mean he would lose vehicle access to his cottage again, so with the help of a friend he raised pounds 175,000 and in 1990 bought the wood. His right of way was once again safe.</p>
      <p>A different dispute with Terry Maule then flared up, this time over a boundary between Maule's property and the woodland which now belonged to Alliss. According to the Alliss family, Maule had put up a fence in the woodland, claiming a chunk of land for himself.</p>
      <p>After the purchase, Alliss's solicitor wrote to Maule asking him to move his fence back to the true boundary. The Alliss family says Maule ignored the request and claimed the boundary had existed since he bought his property more than 20 years earlier.</p>
      <p>The dispute deteriorated. Alliss took the fencing down. Maule re-erected it. Alliss took it down again. There were allegations and counter-allegations. According to Maule, Alliss threatened him and his family on several occasions and once beat him up.</p>
      <p>On the night of July 26 1990, Terry Maule and his 19-year-old son Graig decided to guard the fence. They each went armed with a shotgun. According to interviews read out during the aborted trial at Bristol Crown Court in 1991, the Maules came across Alliss taking down the fence. Terry Maule claimed that Alliss tried to grab the gun and there was a struggle between them, during which Graig Maule was pushed to the ground. His gun went off, hitting Alliss, who staggered down the track for about 30 yards before he collapsed and died. Terry Maule ran to call for an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Alliss's son, Leigh, who was 14 at the time, was walking the family's dogs on land surrounding the cottage when he heard what sounded like a loud gunshot. He says he ran to the spot where he thought the sound came from and there was another bang. A single pellet clipped him on the arm, causing a minor injury. In interviews with the police read out in court, Graig Maule said he had put his gun down, and when he picked it up again it went off accidentally.</p>
      <p>The Maules told police they had taken the guns into the woods in self-defence. "I wouldn't intentionally shoot anyone," Graig Maule told police. "But, you know, I shot Mr Alliss because I was just frightened of him shooting my dad, and I accidentally hit this kid, and I wouldn't do that, of course I wouldn't. I'm not some sort of monster."</p>
      <p>The Maules were jointly charged with murder but the judge directed the jury to return not-guilty verdicts. Mr Justice Schiemann told the jury: "Having considered the evidence over the course of a week or so, I am satisfied that you could not possibly properly come to the conclusion that there was evidence here which could make you sure that there was an agreement to murder Mr Alliss - which is effectively what is charged in the first count of the indictment - or that you could be sure that Graig, when discharging that firearm, was neither acting in defence of his father nor doing it by accident, or something in between."</p>
      <p>Terence Maule was also cleared of possessing a firearm with the intention of endangering life, and both were given an absolute discharge after pleading guilty to having a shotgun without a licence.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Schiemann then went on to praise the way in which Graig Maule acted "in the circumstances". His father, said the judge, could be "proud of him". The Alliss family could barely believe their ears.</p>
      <p>Bob Alliss, Tony's brother, did not sleep for a year after his brother died. He still doesn't sleep well. He has not worked since, and has instead devoted his life to trying to achieve what the family regard as justice. He does not believe that the gun was fired in self-defence; he hopes that the civil hearing, which is listed for January, will establish with evidence from a ballistics expert that the Maules were lying in wait for his brother and that they unlawfully killed him. The Maules' solicitor declined to comment last week.</p>
      <p>"For his life to be snuffed out in the way it was and for the so-called facts of his death to be presented as they were in that court was totally beyond belief," says Bob Alliss. His brother, he says, was grossly misrepresented in the trial. He was portrayed as an enormous, physically powerful man of 6ft 4in weighing 18-20 stone who was always fighting. In fact, according to his brother, he was a far less intimidating 5ft 11in and 14 stone, a family man described in witness statements as conscientious, honest, generous, kind and hard-working.</p>
      <p>"I've gone through life without even a parking ticket, and then to be confronted with something like this is a joke," says Bob Alliss. "People say, 'You've got to get on with your life.' But that was my only brother. I thought we would, with luck, get to old age together. No one can bring back life. Once life is declared extinct, that's it. But there's a need for the truth to play some part in life as a whole."</p>
      <p>Leigh Alliss, now 24, is restless, the tragic death of his father unresolved. "Right from primary school, you get the local copper coming in and teaching you what's right and what's wrong, then something like this happens. I can't settle until it's sorted out. It's like a millstone around your neck. I feel like I'm stuck. You can't move forward. It affects everything in your life.</p>
      <p>"We want the truth out. At the end of the day I can't live with this. I will never be able to live the rest of my life until it's sorted out. If we don't get to court, it will have to be sorted another way."</p>
      <p>Leigh Alliss has already been convicted of assaulting Terence Maule on the fourth anniversary of his father's funeral. The Allisses and the Maules are no longer neighbours, Tony Alliss is dead, but the resentments and grievances will continue until the Alliss family get what they believe is a fair hearing.</p>

      <title>The men who turn home into hell: Domestic violence accounted for half themurders of women in Britain last year. An international conference will be told enough is enough</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Jane is 27 years old. She has a three-year-old son, and she is afraid. "I bet they're looking up, laughing at me. He said he wanted me dead, and he's getting closer. I just don't get it."</p>
      <p>Tonight she is looking at east London from the landing outside her sixth-floor council flat. It's a clear, crisp evening and in an absent moment she describes the wonderful view of the Millennium Dome and the London Eye from her window.</p>
      <p>Then she turns to look at her front door, which is charred black and slightly ajar. She screws up her face at the smell of burnt plaster and carpet.</p>
      <p>Her possessions and those of her son have been destroyed by a fire which started four hours earlier. They were out when the blaze began. They will never live here again. Below, a group of youths are milling in the street. In the dim light it is difficult to pick out faces, but Jane suspects her ex-boyfriend is among them. She pulls up her sleeve and shows a scar from a knife wound: "He did that."</p>
      <p>And the reason she gives for this venomous campaign? "We had a row at a friend's house. I threw my mobile at him. He lost it. He's a nutter."</p>
      <p>DC Euan McKeeve and PC Jackie Howe, from Newham's community safety unit - which investigates domestic violence - listen to the tale. They are not surprised when Jane says she is reluctant to give a statement. It's 7.30pm. They could be here for a while.</p>
      <p>Reluctant</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Sharon Stratton seems embarrassed. Plaistow police station is busy rather than frantic - only four of the nine officers are in this morning - and the overnight list is pretty thin. Nine reports of domestic violence and nobody in the cells.</p>
      <p>"It's not usually this quiet," she says. "Just our bloody luck." Stratton does not usually wish for work. But today is significant - a "national snapshot" of domestic violence is being undertaken.</p>
      <p>Details of every incident are being gathered ahead of a two- day international conference, Enough is Enough!, to be held at the end of the month, which is being organised by the Metropolitan police. The home secretary Jack Straw, the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens and Betsy Stanko, director of the Violence Research programme at the University of London, will be among speakers trying to reposition domestic violence at the top of a cluttered crime agenda.</p>
      <p>Victims, police and policymakers have not always regarded domestic violence as "real" crime, but attitudes are changing. They must. The latest figures are horrifying. Every three days a woman is killed in a "domestic". Last year, more than 77,000 violent incidents were reported in London alone - one every six minutes.</p>
      <p>A quarter of all reported violent crime is domestic. Half of the women murdered last year were killed in fights with their husbands, and on average a woman will be assaulted 35 times, and nearly always in front of her children, before she has the courage to ring the police.</p>
      <p>The cost of helping the victims of domestic violence is estimated at pounds 2bn a year. Stratton's team is in the frontline. Her CSU, which was set up 18 months ago in a reorganisation resulting from the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, investigated 519 incidents in July, more than any other borough in the capital.</p>
      <p>There are West Indian, Asian, African and east European communities in the area, diversity that makes the job more challenging. Officers are loath to stereotype, but in their experience, Asian women are the most reluctant to come forward. One local victim suffered 40 years of abuse before dialling 999. Some Turkish men have been astonished the police regard wife-beating as a crime.</p>
      <p>Although it is quietish this morning, it gives the officers a chance to talk. Cases they describe as "typical" are nothing less than shocking. PC Maria Neeves has called a 29-year-old victim to ask for the return of the panic alarm in her flat. There is a shortage and Neeves needs to give it to someone else.</p>
      <p>The woman, Alison Smith, is having counselling and would prefer to keep the alarm. But she accepts she is no longer a priority because Peter, her ex-boyfriend, is now in jail.</p>
      <p>"I broke off with Peter because I discovered he was seeing another woman," she says. "Even though he had another girlfriend, he couldn't take it. He wanted to get back with me, but there was no way. The trust had gone."</p>
      <p>For the next six months Alison and her mother received anonymous and threatening phone calls. Alison thought she was being stalked. She wondered what lengths Peter might go to. On May 10, she found out.</p>
      <p>Attack</p>
      <p>The night before, he broke into the empty flat next door to Alison's in Forest Gate. Wearing a balaclava and combat gear, he waited. "The next morning I opened the door into the hallway to pick up my post. He grabbed me and pushed me back inside.</p>
      <p>"First, he stabbed me above the right eye. He used a stun gun on me six times and coshed me over the head. He taped up my eyes and mouth, threw me on the sofa and punched me all over and beat my face.</p>
      <p>"He told me if I kept quiet he would kill me quickly, otherwise he would torture me long and slow." Fortunately, a neighbour heard the commotion and called the police. Officers found a petrol can in the flat next door but could not link it to Peter.</p>
      <p>"I think he was planning to kill me then torch the flat," Alison says. Peter pleaded guilty to false imprisonment and was jailed in August for three years. "With good behaviour, he will be out this time next year," says Alison. "I can't believe that's all he's got. I'm thinking of leaving the country."</p>
      <p>Stratton's team regard the conviction as a success because prosecutions are hard to come by. Getting victims to make statements is difficult enough. Getting them to stick to their statements and give evidence in court can be tortuous.</p>
      <p>It is common for victims to make "withdrawal statements" on the eve of trials. Neeves is still getting over the frustration of a case involving a mother who was being abused by an ex-boyfriend, the father of their nine-month-old girl.</p>
      <p>The man tried to batter his way into her house with a piece of wood and said he would kill her if she dared leave. She did, but he followed her to work.</p>
      <p>When she left at the end of the day, he ran down the road hammering on the side of her car, terrifying her baby and eight-year-old son. who were with her. That evening, he returned to her house and battered the door again. Then, he smashed every window of her car. She called the police at 9.40pm, saying "a man was going mad", and he fled.</p>
      <p>As officers took down the details, he rang the house on his mobile phone and told one of them: "I'm going to get someone to blow her kneecaps off and throw acid in her face. I'm going to kill her family . . . you know fuck all, fuck off." When he was arrested, his explanation was, "I get angry."</p>
      <p>The case was dropped when the victim agreed to an out-of-court settlement from his family for the damage to her car. "It's easy to put pressure on a woman, especially if children are involved," says Neeves. "It takes a lot of courage to come forward, especially if your partner is apologising and saying it will never happen again. In most cases, it always does. We know some women who are bound to end up dead."</p>
      <p>Abuse of men by women is extremely rare. Claims of such attacks are almost always made as discrediting counter-allegations. Stratton is dealing with one case involving a pensioner, but again, it seems unlikely it will come to court.</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old victim owns a three-storey house in Forest Gate. When his son married, the newlyweds moved in. The son died 17 years ago, the daughter-in-law stayed and remarried. The victim alleges he was banished to the top of the house and treated like a slave.</p>
      <p>"They sent him out to the shops and if he came back without the right things, they would beat him," says Stratton.</p>
      <p>"The neighbours saw his injuries but he was too afraid to come forward and they said nothing. He suffered this for more than 10 years."</p>
      <p>The man's relatives de ny assaulting him. The victim is terrified and his resolve is weakening. Does he have the strength to go to court? "Probably not," says Stratton. "I'm not sure he can go through with it. He wants to withdraw."</p>
      <p>Advice</p>
      <p>Pek Choo is a social worker assigned to Newham's CSU. She's been working in the field for 17 years, advising women where to get help and whether to pursue their abusers through the civil or criminal court.</p>
      <p>Newham is a poor area, but she says it is ignorant to as sume domestic violence thrives in poverty. "Actresses, dancers, bankers, I've seen them all. With the middle and upper classes, it's just more hidden."</p>
      <p>One of her clients was a woman whose husband worked in the City. She was also highly successful and independently wealthy. "One evening a week, he gave the servants the night off and ordered his wife to make a meal. Once it was prepared, he would take the plate and throw the food down the stairs, crushing it into the carpet.</p>
      <p>"Then he would make her clear up the mess." On one occasion when she protested, he smashed her head against the wall. "Domestic violence is not always physical," says Choo. "It is almost always about control."</p>
      <p>Arson</p>
      <p>The 999 call for the council flat fire came at 4pm. It was classified as an 'I' incident - immediate response - but there were no uniformed officers available . Suspecting it might be their territory, DC McKeeve and PC Howe decide to check it out rather than wait for a report.</p>
      <p>Within minutes of arriving at 6.45pm, their hunch proved right. Jane's ex-boyfriend was seen in the block carrying a brick shortly before the fire. A brick lies by a smashed pane of glass next to the front door.</p>
      <p>The fire brigade believes it was arson, started by someone setting light to the sofa. The scenes of crime officer has arrived to take prints of a footmark and samples of smashed glass - it might be possible to match tiny fragments on the culprit's clothes.</p>
      <p>At 9.07pm, the flat is boarded up with corrugated iron sheets. Jane is wondering where she will stay. She has decided to give a statement but does not doubt this will put her in more danger. "He told a mate of mine that I'd be dead the next time she saw me. There are times when I think I might as well kill myself."</p>

      <p>Feeding the mind:</p>
      <p>There's a revolution a-rumbling and it's happening on a veggie patch near you. Or on an organic smallholding. Or among a clutch of trestle tables on the corner. The city's artisan producers and retailers are springing up fast - encouraging us to reconnect with food in a way plastic microwavable slop never could. These places are feeding the mind as well as the stomach: try Wandsworth's Ditto Deli for tastings, or Shoreditch's retro emporium A Gold for a glimpse of how things used to be. And many, such as the revived Broadway Market, are cracking that most resilient of London nuts: getting city-dwellers to actually talk to each other.</p>

      <p>Cheap eats:</p>
      <p>OK, so it costs more to eat out in London than anywhere else in the world (you'll shell out an average of £39 a head) but that doesn't mean you're limited to pricey eateries serving two molecules of caviar marinated in a coulis of alpine dandelion. The trick is to track down the bargains - from Mexican tortillas at Macondo on Hoxton Square, to the Iranian kebabs of Alounak in Russell Gardens. And with more than 12,000 restaurants serving up cuisine from more than 70 different countries, you could eat out every night for the next 32 years and never visit the same place twice.</p>

Sure-fire springboards into oblivion include Shoreditch's legendary Golden Heart boozer, Stoke Newington's craic-powered Auld Shillelagh Irish pub, or, for the seriously minted, the absurdly hip Sketch on Conduit Street.

      <p>Cultural riches:</p>
      <p>You'd have to be a philistine with a brain of cream cheese to remain unmoved by London's cultural riches. Apart from its 100-plus theatres and music halls, more than 200 museums, and four world heritage sites, there are scores of underground dens serving up everything from burlesque cabaret (Bethnal Green working men's club, workersplaytime.net ) to experimental performance (Peckham's Sassoon Gallery, thesassoongallery.co.uk</p>
      <p>The East End remains a potent force, with new mixed-use spaces like Rivington Place ( rivingtonplace.org ) leading the charge, and tranquil corners such as the 17th-century Chelsea Physic Garden ( chelseaphysicgarden.co.uk ) providing respite from the madness.</p>
      <p>An alternative day out:</p>
      <p>Who needs the London Eye when an insider's itinerary can be so much more invigorating? Set yourself up for the day ahead with filling steak and eggs at the railway carriage brasserie that is Mayfair's Automat ( automat-london.com ) before partying on a Thames beach ( swarming.org.uk/recl.htm</p>
      <p>or taking a ride on London's only steam train at Kew ( kbsm.org</p>
      <p>No afternoon would be complete without checking out Holland Park's Japanese gardens or touring the 26 watering holes of the Monopoly board pub crawl ( monopolypubcrawl.org.uk ). To follow, scare yourself witless on London Walk's West End "Apparitions, Alleyways and Ale" guided tour ( walks.com ) and finish with a seance or masked ball at the Last Tuesday Society ( thelasttuesdaysociety.org</p>

      <p>It's hard to overstate the importance of the 53 runs Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor shared at the end of the day's play. New Zealand fought back well today, but when Latham went, Australia were ticking and a mini-collapse looked very possible. But Williamson - who was especially superb - and Taylor backed up their much-improved bowlers to make it to stumps without alarm. They will return on day three for a bit more digging in; they're still miles behind in the context of the match, but it's not over yet. Russell Jackson will be back in the morning to guide you through the first two sessions of what promises to be a massively intriguing day, and I will see (sort of, I guess) you all for the evening session once more. Turrah - have a fine evening, wherever you are.</p>

      <p>That's the close of play on a better day for New Zealand</p>
      <p>42nd over: New Zealand 140-2 (Williamson 70, Taylor 26)</p>
      <p>They've got a hell of a lot still to do, mind. If you could pick one man to see out the last over of the day for your life right now, it would probably be Kane Williamson. Starc is steaming in - there's some suggestion from some grimaces that he may have hurt his side - with increasing numbers of fielder around the bat, with a silly point in place, but Williamson leaves and defends to see out a maiden.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.57pm AEST</p>
      <p>41st over: New Zealand 140-2 (Williamson 70, Taylor 26)</p>
      <p>That is just lovely from Williamson. Hazlewood drops slightly back of length, and he gets up on his toes and angles the bat to send it behind point for four. The next has the same result and brings up the 50 partnership, this time it's fuller and on leg stump, and he flicks it hard through midwicket. Interesting, this pair are now the most prolific batting partnership in Kiwi history. Williamson leaves the next two outside off, and the fifth is pulled low out to the two men in the deep for a single. Taylor pushes the last, which tails in slightly, back to the bowler. One more over to come.</p>

      <p>40th over: New Zealand 131-2 (Williamson 61, Taylor 26)</p>
      <p>Lyon off, Starc on. Probably not what Ross Taylor - whose injury in an "unimaginable place" Mark Nicholas keeps discussing - fancied. There are men at short leg and leg gully, who Taylor just avoids with ths first ball as they take a single. Both those fielders go for Williamson, and are moved in front of the wicket on either side, close in. Starc's going full and tight to him, and a misfield gives him a single at cover gives him a single off the last.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.48pm AEST</p>
      <p>39th over: New Zealand 129-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 25)</p>
      <p>Hazlewood is living up to his metronome reputation, one that I think damns him with faint praise a bit. Williamson gets bat on the first three, although I reckon he'd rather be leaving. The fourth is fuller and straighter and hits him on the pad, and there's a massive appeal from the bowler that the crowd pick up on and through some interest at. Umpire is unmoved, was clearly going down leg, and Smith will not review. The fifth is a fine bouncer and the sixth defended. Good maiden at a good time from a good bowler at a good batsman. If we want to talk in simple terms.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.44pm AEST</p>
      <p>38th over: New Zealand 129-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 25)</p>
      <p>The winter of this day is coming, and you can feel it a little. Lyon is trying lots of things - over and round the wicket, looking for the developing rough - and Taylor is not trying too much at all, until the final ball of the over, when he deliciously on-drives past a tight mid-on for four. Was lovely, and there wasn't much risk either. Would be a disaster to lose one of these now, it has to be said.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.40pm AEST</p>
      <p>37th over: New Zealand 125-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 21)</p>
      <p>Good from Hazlewood early doors, with Taylor leaving and defending, before unfurling the most stunning extra cover drive from the fourth. He gets four. The fifth is prodded to leg for one and Williamson is safe as houses on the sixth. Both sides will be pretty happy with that over, I reckon.</p>

      <p>36th over: New Zealand 120-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 16)</p>
      <p>Lyon is toying with his field for Taylor, swapping cover and point round and leaving tempting gaps all over the place. But Taylor is not to be tempted, until he pushes one past the straightish midwicket and takes an easy single.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.32pm AEST</p>
      <p>35th over: New Zealand 119-2 (Williamson 60, Taylor 15)</p>
      <p>We'd spotted Hazlewood warming up, and here he is. The length is full and the line is tight, and Williamson can't get the first four away, and the fifth is left outside off. The sixth is played with such soft hands and an open face and runs down to third man for four. Lovely from Kane, again.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.34pm AEST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.30pm AEST</p>
      <p>34th over: New Zealand 115-2 (Williamson 56, Taylor 15)</p>
      <p>Lyon's nagging line continues. Taylor nudges in front of square on the legside for one, before Williamson scampers a single to Warner at 45, the throw comes in and misses Kane, Lyon and the stumps, but is misfielded by Starc at mid-off and there's buzzers. He takes another single to the same man at mid-off, perhaps just because he could.</p>

      <p>Williamson gets his 50!</p>
      <p>33rd over: New Zealand 111-2 (Williamson 53, Taylor 14)</p>
      <p>Williamson pulls Johno for one, before Taylor squirts one past short leg for a single too. Smith is being a bit Pup-esque here with some fields. Catchers in front of the wicket (short cover for Taylor, short point for Kane), and lots of tweaking. Kane doesn't mind, and takes another two in the legside, and then belts a cover drive for four! Awesome. Third 50 on the bounce for Williamson.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.21pm AEST</p>
      <p>32nd over: New Zealand 103-2 (Williamson 46, Taylor 13)</p>
      <p>Good from Lyon, this. Taylor defends stuff angled in at him from around the wicket with the field in close. As Dan points out, there's turn and bounce. It's not easy out there.</p>

      <p>31st over: New Zealand 103-2 (Williamson 46, Taylor 13)</p>
      <p>Johnson is going round the weekend to Williamson and he dabs the third out to deep point to bring up the 100. The field is in for Taylor - leg gully, short leg, three slips, all those types - but he drives a half-volley for three through cover. The fifth ball appears to move a bit, and the last is short but well directed and Williamson pulls out of his pull. Better from Kane.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.12pm AEST</p>
      <p>30th over: New Zealand 99-2 (Williamson 45, Taylor 10)</p>
      <p>First ball of Lyon's new over is slog swept well by Taylor, which is brave. He gets four. The third turns and bounces plenty as Taylor injudiciously tries to cut and there's a bit of chirp. Interestingly, the fielder in the deep has come in ten yards to encourage that slog sweep. Taylor ignores it and cover drives for four.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.08pm AEST</p>
      <p>29th over: New Zealand 91-2 (Williamson 45, Taylor 2)</p>
      <p>Johnson does return. He and Lyon have made for a handy combo in the past. Williamson struggling a little bit now, and has a loose drive with hands away from the body. He takes a single to point to get Taylor on strike, and the first one is at the elbow and pops behind Joe Burns at short leg and they take another single. Williamson defends the last firmly.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.03pm AEST</p>
      <p>28th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 44, Taylor 1)</p>
      <p>Tight stuff from Lyon, who Brendan Fevola has a new nickname for. Slightly edgy from Taylor, but he takes a single sweeping to 45. Williamson is hit on the pad also sweeping and there's a big appeal but surely it's struck him outside the line? Umps says no. They consider a review but decide against it. A leg-bye is scampered.</p>

      <p>That was a cracking catch from Smith, and there was spin and bounce, and Latham had to play it, I think. Nathan Lyon is just so good at coming into the attack cold and making a difference. And what a difference that makes - don't forget the tail starts at seven.</p>
      <p>Starc continues and his line is generally tight, although there's one wide one that Williamson chases and doesn't get much on. It's a maiden. I reckon it won't be long until we see a bit of Mitch Johnson.</p>

      <p>The field is tight for new man Taylor, especially close on the legside. He sees off the final ball of the over.</p>
      <p>This has been a good day for New Zealand so far but they must be careful now. Dangerous times: as ever, over to you Kane.</p>

      <p>WICKET! Latham c Smith b Lyon 36 (New Zealand 87-2)</p>
      <p>The Saturday crowd at the Waca look fun sorts, having a good stretch as Hazlewood loosens up in front of them. Anyway, it's not Hazlewood into the attack but Nathan Lyon. He's bowling over the wicket, and Williamson tucks one round the corner for one for a single. He's round the wicket to Latham, who defends one, then cuts hard for four as the twelfth man gives chase.</p>
      <p>But he's gone! There's some turn and the bat is hung out and Smith takes a fine catch at slip.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 7.48pm AEST</p>
      <p>25th over: New Zealand 82-1 (Latham 32, Williamson 43)</p>
      <p>Starc is bowling nicely here. Williamson rides one and flicks to fine leg before Latham cops one on the inside of the thigh guard. It looks painful, but he doesn't show it. There's a massive gap at cover and that Starc tries to tempt him into searching for, but he resists and that's the over.</p>
      <p>Hussey, Chappelli and Tubs are discussing herring, of all things. They're discussing who is the worst fisherman, and they're all self-effacing claiming it's them. It's all quite jolly, of course it is.</p>

      <p>There are two men back on the pull for the decent little battle between Marsh and Williamson. That sounds like a London estate agent to me. Williamson doesn't care though and pulls safely for one. A couple of balls later, Latham does the same! He gets four for a beautiful stroke, but then gets a bit carried away and tries to drive two quicker ones, and only just misses both. Not clever.</p>

      <p>Williamson has just unfurled the most beautiful cover drive off Starc and gets four for it. I wonder if there should be an extra run given to the most aesthetically beautiful strokes, however many they reap. That deserved at least five. There's a single to fine leg and Latham sees out the over. Starc hit 150 clicks in that over.</p>

      <p>Phil Withall has been in touch on the emails! He has something to get off his chest:</p>
      <p>"Evening Will," he says, "I might be an ageing cynic, actually I am an ageing cynic, but the Australians seem to be effected a subconscious belief that their bowlers would walk through the Kiwis. The pre-match reporting was on how wonderfully they bowl at the WACA. The first test was a little farcical but there is a lot more to the New Zealand batting than a fair few in Australia give them credit for."</p>
      <p>I reckon Phil is right. Latham and Watling are massively underrated players and are very tidy. The worry is that the bowlers start at seven, although Craig is handy and Bracewell and Southee bat well enough too. Lots of "no mugs with the bat" kicking about.</p>

The third moves away from the right-handed Williamson, which is an unfamiliar sight. Popped off the pitch like a leg-cutter. Williamson unfurls a beautiful pull for four off the fifth, then squirts it past short midwicket for a single. Things are happening here. They are going to have some drinks.</p>

      <p>More ball chat, and third umps is coming back. He's bringing out another different ball! Looks like the Aussies are in the umps' ears - Davey, Smudge and Mitch J particularly want a new one. Mitch Marsh continues. His second is a no ball and Williamson looks unperturbed, just playing everything under his nose. Interesting field still - silly mid-off, short midwicket - and Marsh is going for a pretty straight line around off stump. He drops short late in the over but it's another no ball. Eesh, the fifth - or seventh - is a leading edge, he's early on it and it nearly goes to that man at silly mid-off. No dice.</p>

      <p>Starc is back so it's double Mitch. Smith has put a man in at silly mid-off and Williamson sends the ball to him first up. The nest is picked off down to fine leg for another beautifully timed single, then Latham leaves one. For him, there's a closish square leg and a short midwicket. But that doesn't matter! Latham nails the ball through extra cover - where the man's just been moved from - for a lovely boundary. He leaves the sixth and is looking increasingly assured.</p>

Everyone's moaning about the pink one, but the red kook is changed all the time these days.</p>
      <p>Latham miscues Johno through midwicket for two then picks up a bye to fine leg, before Williamson just softly defends short of mid-off for one to bring up the 50 stand. Single from the last, nicely timed drive is cut off by Mitch J, but they sneak a single from the deflection.</p>

      <p>It's Mitch Johnson to start after tea. The first is left outside off and Williamson just hangs his bat out at the second and the ball goes past the outside edge. There's a slightly muted appeal from Mitch and Nevill and, strangely, Smith has gone for the review ! One 'rock and roll that' from Richard Illingworth is enough to show clear daylight between bat and ball. He's not out. Odd review indeed. Williamson's the big wicket and this is the big session but still, literally only Smith thought that was out.</p>
      <p>Jeez, it's all happening. Next nut is rising and Williamson flicks it to leg, but it's hit Joe Burns flush on the lid. He's a tough cookie and is fine, but Doc Peter Brukner is out and checking. He and the helmet are fine. Fair to say Burns is not a volunteer in that position. Williamson takes a single from the next, and Latham defends the last. Phew. Busy one that.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone, wherever you may be. Particular thoughts with you if that wherever happens to be Paris. Truly horrid scenes.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Russell for the first two sessions, Will in the seat now. Been a rather different day's cricket at the Waca, hasn't it? New Zealand snagged themselves 143-7 to (sort of) get back into things, Davey didn't break any more records and Mark Craig - yes, that Mark Craig - almost got a hat-trick. Then Smith declared and Starc got Guptill so ragingly plumb that the two-toed Kiwi didn't even consider a review. Tom Latham knuckled down and Kane Williamson looked glorious as the Aussie quicks purred before the break. Australia looked like they found the right length - nice and full, something that the Kiwis just didn't manage, or at least didn't have the pace to scare from. It's still a proper flattie (although seems to have quickened a bit), but it's amazing what 130 overs in the field, proper pace in your face and 550 on the board can do to a batting side.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I'll guide you through to stumps so please come say via my rather clumsy email address (at the top) or on the twitters at @willis_macp. Should be a cracker at the Waca (sorry).</p>

      <p>Well, Lyon does get a speculative over before tea but a Williamson single is the only moment that gets close to eventful, so New Zealand head to the tea break one man down for 33 and with their batting ace Kane Williamson seeing them beautifully. He and Latham weathered the storm from Starc and Hazlewood and will be looking to cash in a little more after the break, when Will Macpherson will be taking you through all the live action from the Waca.</p>

      <p>This is a profitable little partnership developing now between Marsh and Nevill. The latter picks up two from Craig and then crouches down on the turf to flick him over Watling's shoulder and down to fine leg for a boundary. Thomas Smith, meanwhile, has a Travis Dean update. "Bad news! He has just been dismissed for the first time for 84 (off of 213 balls) which means it took 713 balls to get him out for a combined total of 347 which is now his average. Not a bad start I'd say, although I'm sure he'd be disappointed not to make it back to back to back centuries!" Yeah, lift your game Trav.</p>

      <p>Boult does a decent job of containment at the start of this over with four dot balls but that means little when his last two drop short of the required mark and allow Marsh to swat him for a pair of flat-batted boundaries to leg.

      <p>Craig copped a pasting in his previous over but with Voges gone he gets another chance, which results in a far tidier effort. "Lucky Luke Ablett," says Robert Wilson. "That experience is not so great from the other end. I once dropped a HUGE steepler (and tripped over) during a traffic jam on a nearby road. Judging by the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding level of horn-beeping from the sixty or seventy cars, it was very much appreciated."</p>
      <p>My worst effort was while goal-umpiring a game of Australian Rules football, when the home crowd behind conned me into awarding a goal from a kick that had actually been belted wide from close range. The central umpire thankfully corrected me as Bronx cheers filled the air. I just wanted to dig a hole between the posts at that point.</p>

Boult appears now to replace the flagging Southee and the change pays immediate dividends when he's full and moving it away from Voges and the Western Australian feathers an edge behind to Watling in the process of unleashing a lusty cover drive.

He didn't even get a hold of the first one but it flew past the sight screen like a tracer bullet. Voges plays a very pretty late cut from the over's penultimate delivery but his finesse only gets him one, which hardly seems fair.

      <p>Mark Craig as the honour of the last over before lunch and there's nothing paritcularly worrying therein for Mitch Marsh, who waits four deliveries before batting a gentle cut shot out to the deep for one. Voges pulls for one more and then Craig's final delivery is safely negotiated by Marsh.</p>
      <p>Thus ends the first session on day two, in which the Australians crawled to 69-2 from 29 overs. It was a disciplined effort by the Kiwis and they got some reward, removing David Warner for an imperious 253 and then the Australian skipper Steve Smith, who departed to a rash stroke on 27.

Did he forget to slip, slop slap? That slogan is a decent summary of his bowling in Brisbane, now that I consider it. He starts well here to Marsh, turning it in gently and never offering an obvious scoring option so a single to Voges is the only damage.</p>

      <p>As I'm considering that, Southee drops short to Marsh and though his pull shot is only three metres away from Boult in the deep it's hit firmly enough to beat him to the rope. That fizzed to the fence. Boult's dive was just set design.</p>

After a single to Marsh, Voges picks up two before punishing another one that's pitched up on his pads to pick up a boundary out to mid-wicket and then thumping a short one over the top of point for four more. That was a ragged effort from the medium-pacer. Might be time for some more Trent Boult, I think. Voges is off to the races.</p>

A single from the final delivery means he'll face up to Trent Boult's first ball as well. It's already steaming hot at the Gabba too - into the 30s in the first over of the day.</p>

      <p>A little bit of perspective on life and sport before we start</p>
      <p>As the Waca stops to observe a moment's silence for the lives tragically lost in Paris today, good friend of the OBO Robert McLiam Wilson writes in from Paris.</p>
      <p>"The cricket is not just a vital distraction, Russell, it's a crucial comfort," he says. "I live in the 10th Arr. Some of this happened in my neighbourhood. The streets are empty and the apartment lights are on. No one is sleeping. And everyone is afraid. Even growing up in Belfast doesn't prepare you for this stuff. You reach for any solace. I watched Aussie cricket the night after the Charlie Hebdo attack and found it incredibly consoling. It was something about the Australian sunlight, it's promiscuous optimism. And the sheer, pointless beauty of cricket. It felt like life, being thoroughly and joyously lived. I'm depending on it tonight. It's what you do when you feel hemmed in by life's opposite."</p>
      <p>Thanks for your words Bob and glad to hear that you're okay mate. Let's enjoy this day of hopefully glorious cricket together.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.21pm AEST</p>
      <p>The new David Warner</p>
      <p>"The way that I play my game I really have to cash in when I make 50," Warner tells Channel Nine just now, before underlining how important it is to "cash in" when he gets start. It's one thing to say that of course, but another thing altogether to maintain the concentration required to do it. His now supreme levels of fitness played a big role yesterday too, enabling him to accelerate as the day wore on and the bowlers tired.</p>
      <p>"I think Lara is genuinely under threat today," says Kiwi pundit Ian Smith, echoing my suspicions. Usman Khawaja also stopped by last night to pre-record an interview with Mark Taylor. I guess it's lucky he wasn't listening to Taylor pay out on him all day yesterday during that sublime century of his...</p>
      <p>"I've just ended up converting a couple of scores," says Khawaja of his development. "I'm really glad I've hung in there and got a couple of scores." He was just a joy to watch yesterday and for all the fuss made of Warner's glorious start to the summer, the elevation of Khawaja's game is every bit as important to this Australian side you'd have to think. With Warner, Smith and Khawaja on song, Australia's batting fragility of the past half-decade might be a distant memory soon enough. I guess we should wait until they've done it overseas too.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the 140-character Don is missing from the New Zealand line-up but he's making his presence felt online with this unconventional approach to answering Twitter trolls.</p>

      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>Hello OBOers and welcome to day two of the Perth Test, where Australia's ongoing dominance of their Trans-Tasman foes is the likely story of the day. Russell Jackson here to take you through until tea. You can get me on russell.jackson@theguardian.com or via Twitter (@rustyjacko) throughout the day.</p>
      <p>It's been a truly miserable morning in other senses, of course, and at times like these sport can seem either entirely trivial or a vital distraction, depending on your mood, but we focus our attention now on David Warner's possible pursuit of...I don't think we even need to whisper it...Brian Lara's Test record score of 400. Warner was magnificent yesterday, making the first double-century by an Australian opener since 2004 and putting Australia in a commanding position at 416-2 at stumps.</p>
      <p>What other marks did he knock off? Well, he rose to 7th on the list of most runs made in a single day of Test cricket and of Australians, only Bradman has gone better than the pint-sized lefty. No wonder they're queuing up outside the ground to watch him resume today. Also, no Test opener other than Gavaskar has performed Warner's feat of centuries in three successive innings and it's the sixth time on the trot that the Australian has past 50 in Tests.</p>
      <p>But...He has to start again today. These New Zealand bowlers aren't the mugs he made them look like yesterday and they're led by a proud and tenacious cricketer in Brendon McCullum. For the sake of the contest let's hope the tourists drag themselves back into this one.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.45pm AEST</p>
      <p>It was a record-breaking day at the Waca yesterday, where David Warner put the beleaguered Kiwi attack to the sword to end the day undefeated on 244. Russell will be here shortly to take you through all the live action on day two, but in the meantime you can check out our account of all the action in Perth yesterday. Warner and Australia will resume with the score on 416-2.</p>

      <title>Parliament Agenda : DEFUSING THE PENSIONS TIMEBOMB: THE PENSIONS BILL: The EU is heading for an economic crisis, with a boom in the number of pensioners far outstripping the number of younger people able to look after them. Will the planned bill have the power to turn things around?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The alarm bells could not be louder. Over the next 50 years the EU could have an extra 40 million citizens aged over 60 - and 40 million fewer aged 15 to 60 able to support them. Meanwhile plummeting stocks have decimated the value of accrued pensions and undermined confidence in private and occupational schemes. Tackling the pensions crisis is one of the greatest policy challenges facing the government in the coming parliamentary year.</p>
      <p>How to finance an explosion in the number of pensioners, fill the savings gap - 60% of Britons are not putting money aside for their retirement - and stay on the right side of the business community is proving a conundrum for the government, while opposition parties, the CBI, trade unions, insurers and consumer and charity groups all lobby for their own brands of reform.</p>
      <p>The most detailed hints of forthcoming legislation lie in last December's green paper from the Department for Work and Pensions and its subsequent action plan, published in July. The key proposals are: the scrapping of the compulsory retirement age; the introduction of a pensions protection fund to guarantee a minimum level of benefit to members should the sponsoring employer become insolvent; the obligation upon solvent employers to meet their pension promises in full if a scheme is wound up; the requirement on employers to consult members before making changes to schemes; and the extended protection of private sector workers' schemes in the event of a takeover.</p>
      <p>The pill was sweetened for employers by a raft of plans to "simplify and enable greater flexibility in pension provision for employers and pension providers".</p>
      <p>Perhaps most importantly, the green paper also announced the creation of an independent pensions commission, under former CBI chief Adair Turner, to conduct a major review of the structure of private pension provision and voluntary occupational schemes. This enabled the government to distance itself from any unpleasant medicine that Turner may deem necessary to administer to employers, employees or the pensions industry. An interim report from the commission is due in mid-2004, which will analyse current trends and levels of pension provision, before its first full report in the summer of 2005, no doubt safely after the next election. "Whoever is in opposition will be able to respond to it in a thoughtful way rather than using it as a political football," Turner commented recently.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless the c-word - compulsion - is undeniably the focus of the commission's remit. So are compulsory pension contributions all but inevitable?</p>
      <p>Pressure is certainly mounting on the government from major trades unions who believe that voluntarism is not serving employees' needs. In September, the big four unions - GMB, Amicus, Unison and the T&amp;G - inflicted a resounding blow on New Labour's pensions policy, when they forced a motion in favour of compulsory employer contributions that was passed overwhelmingly.</p>
      <p>The government has, however, been extremely careful to play down speculation over the explosive compulsory principle. When in office with responsibility for pensions, Alistair Darling was said to have believed that forcing voters to save for their retirement could cost the party the next general election. Forcing employers to contribute to occupational schemes now could shatter the party's painstakingly nurtured image as the party of enterprise and a friend of business.</p>
      <p>When presenting the green paper in the House of Commons last December, Andrew Smith declared: "The case for compulsion has not yet been made," but he admitted that it may become necessary if voluntary encouragement fails.</p>
      <p>But more recently the wind seems to have changed. In September, the chancellor told conference delegates that he "welcomed the debate on compulsion" under way by the Turner commission. Meanwhile the economic secretary to the Treasury, Ruth Kelly, was more frank, telling a fringe meeting that if voluntarism could not be made to work, the pensions commission had the power to impose compulsory contributions.</p>
      <p>"We want a strategy of informed choice. But, if that doesn't work, we have the pensions commission, and compulsion is always an option for them," she warned.</p>
      <p>Kelly also accepted that the current system was unsatisfactory, largely because of a lack of trust in the financial industry, but also due to widespread confusion.</p>
      <p>Indeed, research from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) shows that only 13% of people of working age think that their knowledge of pensions issues is good, with 46% reporting that their knowledge is patchy or amounts to "little or nothing". Further DWP research published recently revealed that 40% of adults were saving for their retirement, but only 25% were contributing to an occupational pension - widely accepted as the most efficient means of saving. Part-time workers, and women in particular, risked missing out on structured saving during their years in work.</p>
      <p>The TUC is campaigning to halt the dramatic drop in occupational "defined benefit" (DB) schemes, where employees are guaranteed a pension in proportion to their time in service and final salary, rather than one dependent on their personal contributions and the performance of the stock market. Some 47% of companies, their PensionsWatch research has found, have already shut their DB schemes or are planning to so.</p>
      <p>The pensions minister himself, Andrew Smith, avoided the compulsion issue in his conference speech and instead told delegates the law would be change to "stop employers walking away from their obligations", "using takeovers to scrap pensions" and "changing schemes without consultation". "A pension promise made must be a pension promise honoured," he insisted, focusing on the introduction of the pension protection fund and a lump sum of up to £30,000 for those who deferred their retirement for five years.</p>
      <p>The CBI is, unsurprisingly, steadfastly opposed to the compulsory principle. It attacked union demands for compulsory employer contributions at the Labour conference, saying the measure could cost companies £29bn a year and threaten the viability of some smaller businesses.</p>
      <p>John Cridland, CBI deputy director-general, said: "Pensions are a serious problem but I find it staggering that some people still believe employer compulsion is the answer. They are completely missing the point. Unions should be working alongside employers to make pensions cheaper, not fighting to make them more expensive."</p>
      <p>An international example often cited is the compulsory employer contribution scheme introduced in Australia in 1992. Employees there now receive 9% of salaries in employer contributions, though this has always been based on a sacrifice of salary rises. Critics of the policy claim that saving as a proportion of income per Australian household has dropped significantly since compulsion was introduced. But supporters point to a similar drop in the UK savings ratio where no comparable scheme has been introduced, and to the extra third of Australian adults who had no savings and now have a useful pension pot.</p>
      <p>There are also concerns that a minimum employer contribution in the UK would have to be set at a fairly low level to avoid crippling industry. This could even encourage the more generous companies to cut back on what they are already paying into employees' retirement funds. Another fear is that tax relief on contributions may disappear if pension savings becomes compulsory as there would be no need to incentivise people to save when they are compelled to do so.</p>
      <p>Donald Duval, Australian actuary general 1991-96 and now heading up the UK Society of Pension Consultants, warns that measures aimed at protecting employees may backfire: "Taking the US experience as a guide, we should expect that some employers will use any or all loopholes to dump their pension liabilities on to the pensions protection fund, which will impose additional costs on employers who are maintaining their pension promises, and generally discredit the system."</p>
      <p>As for the pensions commission, Adair Turner has expressed doubts about whether the pensions gap could ever be closed simply by increasing savings alone. He told a recent gathering at the Institute of Actuaries: "What will have to change above all is the average retirement age."</p>
      <p>Indeed, over the course of the last century, the lifespan of a typical British woman rose from 49 in 1901 to 80 in 2000. As we live ever longer, we will be forced to reassess our planning for retirement, something the government is keen to encourage. So the most significant recommendation of the Turner commission could in fact be a radical extension of our working lives, rather than the politically damaging strategy of compulsory contributions for either employers or employees.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether we will be left to grow old gracefully.</p>

      <title>The public services debate: 'Civilising' ethos of private company offers lesson for failing schools: In a second report on how the private sector runs public services, we look at a school in Surrey where the fears of teachers and parents have been dispelled</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is just after 8am on a Monday, and two vans pull up outside Kings College secondary school in Guildford. The first is a battered blue Ford transit, with a crooked yellow Surrey county council children on board sign propped up against a grimy rear window. Shortly after, the second breezes in - a shiny white Mercedes minibus, privately contracted and bearing its pristine logo: Luxury Accessible Transport for the Independent Wheelchair Traveller. Public and private park side by side.</p>
      <p>Both are bringing children with special needs to the school which is at the heart of an impassioned debate about the role of the private sector in public services. The government insists we will have to trade with private companies if we want to swap the old banger that so much public provision has become for the top of the range services that people want. It is not ideology, but what works, that counts, Tony Blair said again last week. Opponents trust the profit making sector with our schools about as far as a car salesman.</p>
      <p>Kings College was the first state school to be handed over to a private company. King's Manor, the old school on the same site, had been failing for years. In the cautious language of schools inspectors it suffered "turbulence". At its worst, this meant disruptive children out of control (one bully managed to corner half a dozen children in a classroom and throw chairs at them); a third of the staff off sick because of stress; and last year only seven children in the school managing to get 5 A-C passes in their GCSEs.</p>
      <p>It was put in special measures in July 1998. Then the Conservative controlled local education authority, Surrey, closed it and invited 3Es, a private company to reopen it under new management last year.</p>
      <p>The transformation has stunned locals. The newsagent up the road had become used to truanting children pilfering during the day. Now she never sees them in school hours and when they do come in on the way home "they seem to have a different attitude, much more respectful". Although the school has been formally open for just one academic year, the first crop of test results under the new regime showed significant rises in grades, and an inspection team is said to have written a glowing report which was circulated widely in Whitehall.</p>
      <p>This experiment with just one comprehensive school in one of the country's most conservative and rich areas, has had a profound influence on government thinking. Labour's education green paper published earlier this year mentions it as a model for "private sector sponsors to take over failing schools". The white paper, due last week, but postponed amid wrangles between Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department for Education and Skills over how far to push the privatisation of schools, is expected to extend this new model rapidly.</p>
      <p>3Es, a not for profit trust, says it hopes to be running up to 100 state schools within five years. Other private companies have been preparing their bids. Benno Schmidt, chief executive of Edison, the profitable but controversial company which runs more than 100 state schools in the US, has been in town sniffing out the possibilities. In an unguarded moment earlier this month the permanent secretary at the Department of Health, Nigel Crisp, let slip that companies "like 3Es could take over failing hospitals".</p>
      <p>Refurbished</p>
      <p>Today David Crossley, headhunted by 3Es from a private international school in Brunei to be the new principal of Kings College, ranges through his newly-refurbished buildings, talking enthusiastically about a new ethos and innovative ways of teaching.</p>
      <p>Why does he think bringing in a private company was necessary at Kings College? Education suffers from a conservatism and command and control structure which has stifled innovation, he argues, but "it doesn't have to be private, that's a red herring. It's the quality of the ideas and some money to implement them".</p>
      <p>The money came from Surrey in the form of a pounds 1.6m capital grant. 3Es will get a performance-linked fee of about pounds 40,000 a year over the 10 year contract if it meets targets. The school's budget is worked out under a standard fomula for a voluntary aided school, with 3Es finding 15% of all capital.</p>
      <p>According to the LEA, the capital grant is no more than other Guildford schools have had in the last 5-10 years, and the fee is the equivalent of what it would have paid as a special grant to maintain a small school. Substantial extra funding has also come from the Department for Education which told Kings College that it qualified for fresh start status, which brings about pounds 250,000 a year in additional annual revenue for three years, and a further pounds 1.7m capital grant. There are fresh ideas. The first is that if you want children to be civilised, you should give them a civilising environment and prepare them for the adult world. "Schools are like old factories with hordes of people moving about at a whistle or bell. The world of work isn't like that anymore, why are schools?"</p>
      <p>Kings is open from 7.30am to 6pm and from next year will be open until 10pm as a community resource centre, to reflect the reality of working parents' lives.</p>
      <p>There are no bells or hordes, because the classes all have a staggered day. Most of the bullying and vandalism used to take place at lunchtime when children were bored and less supervised, so lunch hour has been abolished. Children now eat together with teachers in small groups, first brunch - many do not have proper breakfast at home, and then lunch.</p>
      <p>Architects came in to do what many private companies have done when they want to make a statement about how they have changed. A double height glass foyer with cupola was grafted on to the old 1960s buildings. The reception area now looks more like a hotel or business than an educational establishment.</p>
      <p>Everyone has swipe cards to come and go, and the corridors are hushed and carpeted. The dining hall is now a cyber cafe, fitted with stainless steel, and kitted out with computers and permanent internet access.</p>
      <p>Hour long lessons have been introduced, and since most children concentrate better in the morning, they begin straight away. Assemblies are saved for the end of the day. Teachers have interactive whiteboards and access to the internet, and a resource centre equipped with banks of computers enables children to follow programmes tailored to their own needs. Uniform policy is strict with blazers and ties because "it's important to a sense of discipline and self-esteem and as a statement to the community".</p>
      <p>The key to discipline, according to Mr Crossley, is consistency, clear communication, and noticing things quickly. Every teacher has a computer so they can email a colleague or the head instantly and warn each other if anyone needs special attention. Laura in year nine says the atmosphere is completely different. "There was a lot of messing about before, but now the teachers trust us and praise us and we are able to learn. Some have been expelled. Now people know they can't get away with mucking about."Nine children were excluded under an interim head appointed by 3Es last year and two have been excluded by Crossley.</p>
      <p>Craig Moss, an English teacher who was at the school before the changes, says: "There's no single factor that's made the difference. With a few exceptions they are the same kids. It's an environment of respect, and excellent leadership. They are treated as young adults and they behave as young adults."</p>
      <p>Mr Moss is among the 30% of staff who came from the old school. By the end of the old regime about 40% of teachers were supply staff. Those who wanted to move over were made to reapply for their jobs, and the National Union of Teachers threatened industrial action. In the end there were no compulsory redundancies, and some were helped to find jobs in other Surrey schools.</p>
      <p>The staffing structure at the college today is flat. Rather than the traditional hierarchies of subject department heads, there are just five assistant principals, each responsible for a broad area of the curriculum and some policy or management role. The other teachers are on a basic salary but can win extra pay points for experience or additional responsibility.</p>
      <p>Pay is on national terms and conditions. Crossley says his salary is in the usual range for a head of a full size school. Kings College is small now, there will be 450 on its roll next year but it will gradually build back up to its capacity of about 1,000 children.</p>
      <p>Braith Harris, who has been teaching French for 20 years, opposed a private company coming in at first. "But I'm of a stubborn disposition and I thought, why should I move? Besides, my year 11s had exams to do, I couldn't abandon them." Now she claims she is having the time of her teaching life. Under the old regime she felt "so desperately tired, people used to pull up their drawbridges and just try to teach in their own kingdoms, there were so many disruptive children. I remember teaching one class of 24 of whom 10 had been excluded from other schools".</p>
      <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, which represents some staff at the school, thinks the answer is clear. "Surrey abdicated its responsibility with political motivation. If that extra money was available to 3Es, why wasn't it available before? Many other authorities have turned around failing schools without privatising them. But part of the problem was the marketisation of education."</p>
      <p>Kings College sits in the middle of the Park Barn Estate in north Guildford. Rows of 1950s and 1960s semis line quiet roads, a far cry from the decay of the worst inner city estates. Yet cut off from some of southern England's most affluent residential enclaves by the roar of the A3 on one side and the railway line on the other, Park Barn scores high on deprivation ratings. Almost 20% of children here are living in low income families, compared to a national average of 8%; large numbers of families are on the social services register; 23% of adults are functionally illiterate.</p>
      <p>Crime-ridden</p>
      <p>According to many residents, Park Barn has a very strong sense of community. But it also has its drug dealers. The perception is of a rough school on a crime-ridden estate, and the perception can be more powerful than the reality. In a town where 25% of children are educated privately (the national average is 7%), this was not, as one parent put it, "where nice people sent their kids". By the mid-1990s, King's Manor was caught in a spiral of decline. The Tory reforms introduced with the 1988 Education Act allowed money to follow pupils to popular schools. Several in Guildford opted out of local authority control and acquired grant maintained status. Those in more prosperous areas and with strong management attracted children from outside their areas. King's Manor's roll fell inexorably. Because it had spare places, it had to take more and more pupils who had been excluded for behavioural problems from other schools.</p>
      <p>The former head, Greg Gardner, knew things were going wrong. "In the mid-1990s we took in about 50 children a year because they had been unsettled elsewhere. There was mobility all right, but it all went one way."</p>
      <p>Mr Gardner's response to these market forces was to concentrate on working with the community and with special needs. Although the school's Ofsted inspection in 1993 identified several strengths as well as weaknesses, he thinks now it would have been better if they had been failed then. "We might have got more help."</p>
      <p>He feels let down by the LEA, but he is reconciled: "I don't think you need to privatise a school to change its character, but at a political level perhaps you do have to. You can't change people's perception of a school without a huge injection of re sources to get over that parental mental block."</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke, Surrey's deputy director of education, is the man who started "the privatisation revolution but without meaning to". Mr Clarke watched King's Manor decline but felt hamstrung. In Surrey about 10% of schools had opted out of local authority control, and he spent the mid-1990s fighting to keep the LEA alive. He had intervened in two other sub-standard schools only to lose control of them.</p>
      <p>By 1996-97, the climate began to change. Tory politicians now wanted action. Mr Clarke asked all his Surrey superheads if they would be prepared to take the school on. None thought it possible to rescue it by normal means.</p>
      <p>"I didn't start off with the idea of privatisation, but I knew that, like it or not, we were working in a market system. You had to sell it to people, particulary the middle classes, as genuinely new."</p>
      <p>The county's education committee invited Benno Schmidt of Edison over. He visited and said: "I can turn this round in 18 months, no problem. We never heard any more from him," says Mr Clarke. By the summer of 1998 he was increasingly worried. It was clear that an Ofsted inspection would fail the school. "I knew I had to pull a rabbit out of a hat."</p>
      <p>In desperation he wrote two three-line letters, one to Neil McIntosh, director of the Centre for British Teachers, a not-for-profit organisation advising on education in Hackney and Lambeth, and one to Kevin McNeany, chairman of Nord Anglia, a company which rescues private schools and is listed on the stock exchange.</p>
      <p>"I know it sounds naive, but McNeany had written a piece in the Daily Mail accusing LEAs of failing, so I wrote saying, 'OK, so what would you do about it?' " They agreed to put in bids for a contract to run it as a voluntary-aided school.</p>
      <p>Horrified</p>
      <p>Parents, faced with the prospect of closure or handing over the school to the private sector, were horrified. Steven Archibald had experienced its decline at first hand - his eldest daughter, fed up with the disruption to lessons and bullying behaviour of some peers, asked to be moved mid-year. Her sister followed her, but his third daughter did not and "suffered a couple of blighted years".</p>
      <p>Yet he was appalled at the idea of giving up on it. "The thought of Edison coming in was like a red rag to a bull. Here was a flagship LEA running hundreds of schools talking about bringing in and paying a US company with no experience of running British secondary schools." He became vice-chairman of the action group set up to save the school. Teachers mean while were questioning Surrey's legal right to hand it over, and warned that "this will be the thin end of a very thick privatision wedge".</p>
      <p>Under EU law, the bids had to be put out to competitive tender. In October 1998, in response to his advertisement, Clarke received a call from 3Es.</p>
      <p>Education, education, education, was Tony Blair's mantra in the 1997 election campaign. The 3Es in chief executive Stanley Goodchild's book are education for schools, education for parents and the community, and education for business and industry.</p>
      <p>3Es, a not-for-profit trust, is the commercial arm of Kingshurst City Technology College in Birmingham. And it is at Kingshurst that the Kings College Guildford vision for educational reform was pioneered. The principal of Kingshurst is Valerie Bragg and with Mr Goodchild, to whom she is now married, she has been working to create "a new model for education in the 21st century". Kingshurst is in a deprived estate of Solihill, and 35% of the college's students are entitled to free school meals. Nevertheless 90% of its comprehensive intake stay on in the sixth form, and 91% reach government targets for GCSEs. "Kingshurst is so much better than any other place you've ever visited it's almost creepy," says Mr Clarke.</p>
      <p>Mr Goodchild's philosophy is that you cannot mend a school without mending a community. He and Ms Bragg were keen to show that they could achieve what they had in Birmingham in other schools with different staff.</p>
      <p>Steven Archibald was among a group of parents invited to Kingshurst to see 3Es in action. "I was welling up. These were children from a far more deprived area than ours and they were giving them a proper chance being denied to our children by Surrey." Parents organised a poll. All but one voted for 3Es. Surrey awarded them the contract.</p>
      <p>Kingshurst seems to have had a similar effect on David Normington, now permanent secretary at the DfES, who has regular video conferences with Bragg when he wants to thrash out policy problems. In April after a visit to Kingshurst he wrote to Andrew Adonis, Tony Blair's education adviser, who is said to be behind the view, if not the phrase, that we have to move on from "bog standard comprehensives".</p>
      <p>"Andrew, it has to be seen to be believed. What you can achieve!" In a page littered with exclamation marks Mr Normington describes being moved almost to tears by the wisdom and maturity of "children from the most blighted backgrounds, for whom otherwise the prospects would most likely be the dole". How many more Valeries can we find, he asked.</p>
      <p>Not many, according to Steve Clarke. His view is that there is not enough experience in the private sector to regenerate schools: "It would be unwise to have a rapid expansion in this direction."</p>
      <p>The most striking characteristic of Goodchild, Bragg and Crossley mentioned repeatedly by those dealing with them, is how steeped they are in the ethos of service and egalitarianism. Teachers and parents at the school simply do not feel they are working for the private sector. Mr Archibald sums it up: "I still struggle with all this 'privatisation' stuff. That's not how we see it. This company is a not for profit organisation. Its heart and mind is embedded in education."</p>
      <p>Sue Doughty, the new Liberal Democrat MP for Guildford, thinks the model could be useful but has drawbacks. "Once you hand a school over to the private sector, it's gone." She like others questions why state money has been poured in only now that the private sector has moved in, and fears that it will have a knock-on effect on schools nearby.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless the bandwagon seems to be rolling. 3Es is being given a second contract by Surrey to run France Hill, a school in Camberley judged to be improving but whose roll is falling. Nord Anglia has also been given a contract by Surrey for a further school. "You can't just stick to your principles and say everyone should have the same because then the poorest get the worst public services," says Mr Clarke.</p>
      <p>Mr Archibald unconsciously echoes Mr Blair's "it's what works" approach. "At the beginning of all this I would have said that the LEA should have done it. But latterly and reluctantly I have come to the belief that it needed private sector involvement to overcome people's prejudice. It works."</p>

      <title>Film &amp; Music: Cover story: Our tunes: Thanks to guerrilla gigs, the internet and fan-friendly bands, 2005 saw music lovers reclaiming the charts. Laura Barton tracks a grassroots revolution in the record industry</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is hard to pinpoint when things began to go wrong between the major record labels and the music-buying public. All anyone can say with any certainty is that the fun went out of the relationship a while ago. Maybe it was the record indus-try's sour-faced approach to illegal file-sharing and downloading. Or perhaps it was the deadening routine of Pop Idolry and over-hype. Either way, it was hardly surprising when the fans began to seek excitement elsewhere.</p>
      <p>This has been the year fans have increasingly taken music into their own hands, rejecting the over-processed diet served up by many major labels in favour of something a little more homemade. In the process they have notched up numerous high-profile successes, including Arctic Monkeys, Arcade Fire, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Spinto Band and Nizlopi.</p>
      <p>Enabled largely by the internet, bands have been able to record and promote their own music, and fans to revel in it and pass it on - without the aid of major label backing, stylist and towering billboard advertisements. Furthermore, fans are finding it ever easier to interact directly with their favourite bands, rather than seek nourishment from the insubstantial publicist-approved quotes given in interviews. The result, of course, is that the charts in 2005 have become imbued with a rather joyous and friendly anarchy.</p>
      <p>Arguably, it was the Libertines who set the pace; the baton then passed to Babyshambles and imminently to Carl Barat's new band, Dirty Pretty Things. Characteristically, Libertines gigs (and those of their circle) eschewed the over-priced ticketing, over-priced ale gig- going conventions that had become standard in the Clear Channel era, and instead guerrilla gigs were played ad-hoc in bizarre venues, such as rooftops, farms and the London underground. Fans were informed of the "venue" hours before in a flurry of emails, website postings and text messages, and would travel from all over the country to congregate at the elected hour and see their favourite band play inches from them (and probably go to the pub with them afterwards). Pete Doherty allowed fans to bed down in his flat if they missed the last train home.</p>
      <p>The Libertines' and Babyshambles' sprawling international fanbase was largely united by the internet, on forums such as Conversations in Arcady, and websites Babyshambles.net and Spirit of Albion. The most intimate of the sites, however, is Balachadha.com. Launched in August, and created with his friend and literary agent, Paul Roundhill, Bala Chadha is intended to be a living biography of Doherty, as well as a method of reducing the gulf between himself and his fans. The opening page shows a tattered Doherty, sitting on a sofa playing acoustic guitar and singing.</p>
      <p>Bala Chadha's moderator is Texas Bob, who moved to London in 1996, having heard of Camden's most infamous pub, then the hub of Britpop. "I got a one-way ticket here so I could go to the Good Mixer," he explains. Bob, who is 37 and works in the post room of a mail-order company by day, spends his free time videotaping his favourite bands. He met Babyshambles through mutual friends the Paddingtons and was instantly smitten. "In my lifetime, I've never known a band break down the wall between the band and the fans like Babyshambles."</p>
      <p>In another example of rapidly augmenting fan power, this year's Christmas No 1 contender is a largely unheard-of band, Nizlopi, singing about driving a JCB. Quite how a formerly niche band could floor the sleigh-belled, gospel-powered might of the major label yuletide offerings is a lesson in humility, hard graft - and the power of the circulated MP3.</p>
      <p>Nizlopi's fortunes changed almost two months ago, when the Daily Star mentioned the JCB Song three times in a week as a potential candidate for the Christmas number-one spot. At the time, the band had odds of 33-1. But then the strangest thing happened - across the country fans began placing bets on Nizlopi - not just trifling sums, but big, bold £40 bets. The odds tumbled and within a week they stood at 14-1. This week, still at number one, their odds are just behind The X Factor's Shayne.</p>
      <p>Nizlopi had already established a solid fanbase, having employed a similar tactic to Babyshambles, albeit a little cosier, often choosing to play in people's living rooms. Dedicated Nizlopi fan Lloyd Ellis, 33, who works in a bookshop and as a cartoonist, welcomed the band into his home: "There were about 50 people sitting on my sofa, on chairs, the floor, lots of nibbles - they played for over an hour."</p>
      <p>Ellis first saw the band by accident when they were sharing a bill with his friend. "The night I first saw them changed my life," he says. He rarely went to gigs before but Nizlopi changed that, and Ellis now promotes bands himself as well as launching a Nizlopi fansite. "They captured my imagination," he says. "I pinpoint the moment I decided they were the best band in the world to the point during the JCB song where they did the line 'pull over to let the cars pass' and they both went 'vrrrrm'." It might appear to be a curious eureka moment, but to Ellis it embodied all that was good and right about Nizlopi. "It's their charm. I've introduced a lot of friends to them, that's how it spread, word of mouth."</p>
      <p>Word of mouth - and its hi-tech equivalent, the website link, plays a large part in fan power. As Texas Bob argues: "The record companies didn't count on bands banding together, helping one another out." Indeed it was via the Trap2 website that Steve McInerney stumbled across another Sheffield band, the Arctic Monkeys, and so changed his life in ways previously unimaginable to the 20-year-old record-shop worker from Manchester.</p>
      <p>"People sent me their MP3s," he recalls, "I remember downloading their I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, and the lines made me laugh out loud. I told all my friends at uni about them. I was smiling all the time." McInerney now moderates on the Arctic Monkeys' website forum. "At first it was about 50 people on the forum now there's a thousand or something," he says, with uncontained awe. "But we have another chatroom, about 300 people, most who meet up for gigs and stuff." Six months ago, he met his girlfriend at an Arctic Monkeys gig. "She went up to one of the band in a club the other week," he laughs, "and said - she was a bit drunk - 'I want to thank you because I met my boyfriend 'cause of you.'"</p>
      <p>He frequently travels to Sheffield to see the band, and is even in the video for Fake Tales of San Francisco, as well as being name-checked in a song by another Sheffield band, Little Man Tate, for whom he will probably roadie when they tour next year. "A year-and-a-half ago I was just a student in Manchester, and now I'm part of the music scene in Sheffield," he says with undiluted glee.</p>
      <p>McInerney believes Arctic Monkeys fans are in a class of their own, and it is this that will ensure the band's ongoing success. "I've never met fans who talk about their band so much," he says. "There's dedication. Turning up to gigs and everyone knows the words to all the songs. I know fans who drive up and down the country going to every gig on the tour. A fan from America came over from San Francisco. We'll always stick by them, we'll always buy their singles."</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most heartwarming tale of Arctic Monkeys fandom involves the sharing of the band's demos online. "There's a guy called Sherrif who sent me the MP3s, 15 demos," explains McInerney. "He hosted this infamous link - I can still remember the link off by heart 'cause I forwarded it to so many people. He got fined a grand for excessive bandwidth cos he sent so many links, and all the fans clubbed together to pay him back and clear his debt."</p>
      <p>But the major labels say they aren't quaking in their boots just yet. The events of the past 12 months have simply expedited the shift in the way they operate in A&amp;R, marketing, and new media. "Has this changed our job? Not at all," says Luke Bevans, new media manager for Universal Music/Mercury Records. "I think the Arctic Monkeys phenomenon is a red herring, it happened because it was a great song and it connected with people . . . people swap music, and send each other files. I believe in free downloads - we've been offering them for over 18 months as samples for new acts." He cites as an example a new "singles club" for a new act, Boy Kill Boy: "Every two weeks for six months people can log in and get a free download. But they are just the equivalent of what used to be cover-mounts."</p>
      <p>The difference, perhaps, is essentially where and how people are now finding out about new music. "It just proved that having a strong online marketing campaign worked," argues Bevans, "rather than just being some thing we should be involved with." There have been other changes too, of course: "In terms of what the A&amp;R department do, I would say yes, sites like myspace are a good way to look for new music, to listen to it before you see it live, and to find out what people are enjoying, what groups are listening to. For record companies to ignore that would be stupid."</p>
      <p>For some bands it is not just about the internet - Wakefield upstarts the Cribs have secured a dedicated following by touring their hearts out. Signed to Wichita in 2003, they did not have the budget for advertising or videos and so played as many gigs as possible to get themselves known, often just for beer. It was a wily tactic: a fantastic live band, the Cribs swiftly found themselves an enviable reputation. "When (the single) Scenesters came out, if the charts were just on downloads we would have gone in at number 13," says Ryan Jarman, their singer and guitarist. "In the end we went in at 25." It was still a triumphant moment for the Cribs and he believes, two fingers to the labels' way of operating. "It showed it wasn't about adverts," he says. "Labels think you throw enough mud and some'll stick. But having a hardcore fanbase is worth far more than a backpage ad on the NME."</p>
      <p>Fans, he says, do the marketing for you. "They never shut up telling people about you. It's only certain bands (who get that level of devotion), the kind of bands people make a human connection with, people really appreciate the honesty." And their fans are hardcore. "We've had people flying over from Japan (and back on the same night)," says Jarman with disbelief. "I never buy clothes and so we have fans who bring me T-shirts. They nick them too, but I think easy come, easy go." And the band are happy to mingle with their T-shirt-snaffling devotees. "I love hanging out with people after gigs, that's part of it," Jarman says.</p>
      <p>And maybe this is part of it. Weary of stadium rockers with their "let them eat cake" and "where are the groupies?" attitudes who have populated music over the past three decades, fans are pushing their own heroes. They may not be as pretty as Rachel Stevens, they may not be as well-produced as Boyzone, but they carry with them a fanbase willing to do quite literally anything for them.</p>
      <p>"I really think in the wake of John Peel dying, more people on Radio 1 are trying to give air-play to new bands," says Ellis. "Live music is so alive at the moment, and the internet is making A&amp;R men redundant." Texas Bob would take it one step further: "For so long, bands had to bow down and kowtow to the record companies," he says. "Now you don't need record companies - you have sites where bands can put music out and garner this core group of fans. Fans who will do anything for you. It's the fans who have revolutionised music."</p>

      <subtitle>A playful portrait of the pop artist in A Day In The Life Of Andy Warhol, a murder in the City in New Tricks and lots of laughs in Goodness Gracious Me Special. Plus: back to the classroom in Educating Cardiff and School Swap - The Class Divide</subtitle>

      <p>New Tricks 9pm, BBC1</p>
      <p>New Tricks goes all Wolf Of Wall Street (well, Threadneedle Street) when Steve stumbles upon the apparent murder in the 80s of a City futures trader who was part of a group that called itself The Wolfpack - a bunch of pin-striped wallies who were into some debauched shenanigans when they weren't hauling in the cash. Tracking down his old partners in crime leads the Ucos team into a murky web. Meanwhile, Steve is skint, but hopes to learn a few stock market tricks to get him out of a hole. Ben Arnold</p>
      <p>School Swap - The Class Divide 9pm, ITV</p>
      <p>As Warminster headmaster Mark Mortimer explains during the concluding part of this school-swap experiment, the crucial difference between state and private education isn't what happens in the classroom but what happens outside it. However, what are we to make of his contention that public school pupils don't rely on influential connections for a leg-up? "That may have been the case 250 years ago [but] I certainly don't think it is any more." Meanwhile, Bemrose head Jo Ward has some prejudices challenged. Ali Catterall</p>
      <p>Educating Cardiff 9pm, Channel 4</p>
      <p>New series of the always inspirational documentary series set in a British secondary school. This year, the cameras are trained on the pupils and staff at Willows High School in Tremorfa, south Wales. With only our own horrific (or otherwise) memories of big school to go on, this show reassures all parents that there are at least two Robin Williams/Morgan Freeman types in any given institution who will act as emotional lighthouses to our hormonal, directionless offspring. Julia Raeside</p>
      <p>A Day In The Life Of Andy Warhol 9pm, BBC4</p>
      <p>In this idiosyncratic doc, Stephen Smith attempts to demystify pop art's most enduring superstar by channelling another inscrutable cultural icon: Jack Bauer. Smith gathers intel from Warhol's surviving friends and co-workers to reconstruct, hour by hour, a typical 1964 day for the defiantly atypical artist. This involves a trip to Warhol's local supermarket in search of Campbell's soup and eating ice-cream at his favourite dessert restaurant. Playful, in a way the subject himself might have enjoyed. Graeme Virtue</p>
      <p>Secrets Of China 9pm, BBC3</p>
      <p>What's it like to grow up in modern China? Kicking off this three-part series, Billie JD Porter considers the theme of conformity. Respect for the state and elders is drilled into Chinese youngsters from a young age, but some still rebel - so Porter heads for a bootcamp where disobedient kids spend months at a time having their thinking rearranged. Around a third of boys at the camp turn out to be hooked on online gaming, and the doc posits the idea that this statistic may be linked to the pressure to fit in or fail. Jonathan Wright</p>
      <p>Goodness Gracious Me Special 10pm, BBC2</p>
      <p>This one-off is a reminder of how funny Goodness Gracious Me is. Meera Syal and Nina Wadia are the Competitive Goddesses, sitting on clouds totting up how many worshippers they have on their smartphones. Meanwhile, Captain Brownadder takes to the trenches, and Gandhi is reinvented in a Martin Scorsese film. One of the highlights sees the India Broadcast Company, home of "lavish new costume drama, Brownton Abbey", deal with a new head of diversity who suggests an English season. Hannah Verdier</p>
      <p>Fried 10.30pm, BBC3</p>
      <p>There are lots of great things about this boisterous new comedy based around a failing fried chicken shop. For one, manager Mary (Katy Wix) spends most of this opening episode doing an impression of a fictitious Spaniard named Carlos, complete with 70s specs and tache. Mandeep Dhillon, Matthew Cottle and co are also on fine form as her colleagues, battling against inebriated customers at "drunk o'clock". Some gags are a little by-the-numbers but this series still looks to be more sizzling than half-baked. Hannah J Davies</p>
      <p>Film choice</p>
      <p>Hobson's Choice (David Lean, 1954) 10.45am, More4</p>
      <p>Delightful screen version of Harold Brighouse's stage comedy, filmed in the authentic industrial-Lancashire atmosphere of Salford. It is beautifully played, with Charles Laughton as the boozy bootmaker who is tied up in knots by his eldest daughter (Brenda de Banzie) and her dim but lovable husband (John Mills). Warm as a ferret up a trouser leg. Paul Howlett</p>
      <p>Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010) 12.50am, Film4</p>
      <p>Aronofsky's deliriously off-the-wall horror-drama has a painfully intense Natalie Portman as ballerina Nina, who is chosen to play Odette/Odile in Swan Lake. But overbearing director Vincent Cassel's insistence that she must find her dark inner self in order to play the evil Black Swan leads to a spectacular breakdown in which reality and fantasy merge horribly.

      <title>Racing: Buck's faces simple task in bid to emulate Bula: Only six opponents for the Newbury feature Nicholls runner long odds-on to win 13 in a row</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Big Buck's is rated a near-certainty to take another step towards the all-time record for consecutive wins over hurdles on Saturday after Paul Nicholls's outstanding stayer appeared at the head of a field of seven possible runners for the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Grade Two contest had been reopened after failing to attract sufficient entries at the five-day stage, but there still appears to be little in the field to worry Big Buck's, who has won 12 consecutive races since unseating Sam Thomas at the final fence in the 2008 Hennessy Gold Cup.</p>
      <p>Victory will match the 13-race winning streak recorded by Bula in the 1970s, and take Big Buck's to within sight of the 16 wins of Sir Ken, who won the Champion Hurdle three years in a row from 1952.</p>
      <p>Should Big Buck's follow his schedule of the last two seasons, when he has won all four of his starts, he could equal Sir Ken's record in the Liverpool Hurdle at Aintree in April, assuming that he can win the Long Walk Hurdle in late December and then a fourth World Hurdle in March, for which he is currently the 10-11 favourite.</p>
      <p>Paddy Power opened a book on the race yesterday, but it is unlikely to attract many win-only punters with Big Buck's priced up as the 1-6 favourite. With seven runners and two places, it is an unattractive heat for each-way backers too, and the 9-1 chance Sparky May, whose official rating gives her 26lb to find with the favourite, is the only other runner at single-figure odds. Duc Du Regniere, who will represent first-season trainer Tom Symonds following his switch from the Nicky Henderson yard where Symonds was previously the assistant, is a 10-1 chance.</p>
      <p>The issue of the future funding of racing if or when the Levy system is abolished returned to Parliament yesterday, when it was the subject of a private members' debate in Westminster Hall.</p>
      <p>The debate had been secured by Matthew Hancock MP, the member for West Suffolk, whose constituency includes Newmarket. Opening the debate, Hancock stressed that racing is suffering a "breakdown in funding" as a result of declining yield from the betting Levy paid to the sport by bookmakers. "The changes in the way that people bet and the move to more online gambling," Hancock said, have "outstripped the outmoded outfit that has determined racing's funding."</p>
      <p>Hancock said that the core of his argument was that "central to the fall in the value of the Levy has been the removal from British shores of almost all of the main bookmakers. Of the 20 biggest bookies, only two are now domiciled here in the UK."</p>
      <p>He continued: "Dealing with the offshore is the first problem we need to sort out to deal with the problems of financing the racing industry. Let's have everybody onshore paying their fair share of tax and Levy contributions. I think the solution that (John Penrose MP), the minister put forward in July is a neat one. By changing the designation of the location of a bet from where the bookie is based to where the punter is based would turn what is at the moment legitimate tax avoidance into tax evasion. You could capture the vast majority (of bets) because all of the major bookmakers who, for instance, want to advertise or do other business in the UK will come onshore because they wouldn't want to be breaking the law by not paying tax and levy on their bets."</p>
      <p>For the government, John Penrose MP, the minister with responsibility for racing at the department of culture, media and sport, said that he had been pleased to hear the proposal on switching the designated location of bets described by various speakers as "simple" and "elegant".</p>
      <p>He also suggested that once offshore betting operations have returned onshore for tax purposes, it will be up to the racing and betting industries to reach an agreement on a funding mechanism.</p>
      <p>"I am very much taking the approach," Penrose said, "that if the industries . . . together can come up with something which they are both willing to sign up to, then at that point, providing it satisfies some very basic principles of fairness, it is not up to politicians to second-guess what those industries can agree."</p>
      <p>Captions:</p>

      <p>Eight birdies, no bogeys for Shane Lowry in his 63 today. A quite sensational performance that could well have won him the 148th Open Championship! He's so close. He's got four strokes on his nearest challenger Tommy Fleetwood - who let's not forget shot a magnificent 66 today - and six on third-placed JB Holmes. But there's many a slip twixt Claret Jug and lip. Twenty years ago, Jean van de Velde shipped a five-shot third-round lead at Carnoustie, and you don't need me to tell you what happened next. Also, it was only three years ago when Lowry himself went into the final round of the US Open at Oakmont with a four-shot lead, only to blow it, traipsing home with a 76. And who knows what might happen when the forecast rain and wind arrives? So nothing's certain. BUT if Lowry keeps his head around a course he knows so well, expect an Irishman to be crowned Champion Golfer in Ireland tomorrow evening!</p>

      <p>Lowry speaks! "My mind's a bit fuzzy! I just really enjoyed today. Obviously I played great golf. The crowd were incredible. I just felt so comfortable out there. I'm hoping I feel that comfortable tomorrow, I'll have a tough 24 hours ahead. But you know what, there's nowhere I'd rather be! I've got a four-shot lead at the Open Championship in Ireland. Tomorrow's going to be incredible, regardless of what happens."</p>

      <p>It's a new course record for Shane Lowry! It's only - only! - a 63, as his effort to match Branden Grace's major-championship record of 62, set at the Open two years ago at Birkdale, stops one dimple short of the cup. So close! Par. But so brilliant! An astonishing round that puts him 18 careful holes away from his first major title. JB Holmes makes his birdie putt, meanwhile, and he signs for a decent 69. He'll be in the penultimate group tomorrow as a result.</p>

      <p>Yet another wonderfully controlled iron by Lowry. He swishes it into the centre of the green. He's pin high, 30 feet to the right. One putt for a 62! Holmes knocks his second to 12 feet or so, but it's an afterthought for just about everyone in the stand. The crowd give it up for Ireland's hero as he strides up the fairway, honouring one of the great rounds in Open history. Imagine what it's going to be like if he closes this out tomorrow!</p>

      <p>Two-putt pars at 18 for Lee Westwood and Tommy Fleetwood. After a one-under 70, Westwood is almost certainly out of it at -8. Fleetwood's superb 66 ensures he'll be in the last group, and will have an opportunity to perhaps apply a little matchplay-style pressure to Lowry. But at -12, he'll be giving up four shots to his opponent from the get-go... as things stand, anyway. Back down the fairway, Lowry is preparing to launch his last approach of the day into the green.</p>

      <p>Yep, it's three birdies in a row for Shane Lowry, and suddenly he's four clear at the top! A birdie up the last, and he'll equal Branden Grace's major-championship record of 62. This is an astonishing performance, and the gallery responds in a manner which may cause damage to either the ozone layer or the space-time continuum. Perhaps both. What a round this is!</p>

      <p>Lowry can do no wrong! He bumps a simply sensational wedge at 17 to three feet. He'll have that putt to go eight under for his round! And for the second hole in a row, JB Holmes sends in a shot that under any other circumstances would look incredibly good, only to find himself upstaged by the hero of the hour. Spooked, he misses his six-foot birdie putt, and drops his putter in impotent frustration. Meanwhile up on 18, a great reception for Fleetwood and Westwood, both on the green in regulation but neither within realistic birdie distance.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 7.32pm BST</p>
      <p>Justin Harding's bid fell apart after the turn. After those back-to-back bogeys at 11 and 12, he dropped another strike at 15, and he ended up with a three-over 74. The South African ends the day at -3. His playing partner Cameron Smith also let things slip, following up his excellent eagle-birdie whammy at 12 and 13 with a double at 14. A level-par 71 promised so much more. He's -6.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 7.28pm BST</p>
      <p>Westwood can't make his birdie putt at 17. Par. Listening to the roar from the 16th, he wears the look of a man who knows the jig is up. Fleetwood's birdie effort never looks like dropping either. His expression isn't quite so grim, but he's not exactly turning cartwheels. Back on the tee, Lowry crashes a huge drive down the left of the fairway. A good chance to get up and down from 60 yards or so.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 7.26pm BST</p>
      <p>But Shane Lowry is simply unstoppable! He rolls in his birdie putt, and now he's got a three-shot lead at the top! If he pars the final two holes, he'll set a new course record.</p>

      <p>The leaders aren't finished, though. Lowry arrows one of the tee shots of the day at 16, to 12 feet. Calamity? What Calamity? Holmes finds the centre of the green, a very fine effort by any other metric. But the crowd only have eyes for their man. Up on 17, Fleetwood's drive bounds down the track, and he wedges to 12 feet to set up a birdie chance. Meanwhile Westwood's tee shot is pulled into thick nonsense down the left, but a mixture of adrenaline and frustration allows him to power his second into the green and leave a birdie chance of his own!</p>

      <p>Lowry whips a fantastic second at 15 to 12 feet. Holmes follows him in, albeit with a huge stroke of luck, a pulled approach taking a huge kick off a bank on the left back towards the flag. But Holmes can't take advantage, missing the birdie chance. No such problem for Lowry, who carefully slides a left-to-right tickler into the cup, and suddenly there's a little separation at the top of the leaderboard. Which we'll illustrate in a couple of minutes, because...</p>

      <p>Justin Rose is furious with himself going up the last. Like McIlroy yesterday, he sends in a draw, and while his ball lands on the green, it's always going to topple off the left-hand side and down the bank. Brooks Koepka is on in two. If he can sink the 25-footer he's left himself, he'll fancy his chances of making up some ground tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Westy's not heading south quite yet! He flips a delicate chip out of the filth and across the 16th green, his ball gently resting next to the hole. He escapes with a par and remains at -8. Fleetwood meanwhile takes his two putts for par. Meanwhile no birdie for Jordan Spieth at the last, and he signs for a 69. At -7, it's probably not enough... though the wind will be picking up tomorrow, and you never know how that may pan out.</p>

      <p>The wheels are threatening to come off the Westwood wagon. His tee shot into Calamity dribbles into the thick rough to the right of the green. A tricky up and down coming up. Fleetwood by contrast finds the dancefloor, back left. Not close to the pin, but not miles away either. Safe and sound. He'd take a two-putt par here any time of any day.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 7.07pm BST</p>
      <p>While Lowry took advantage of the huge stroke of luck he enjoyed off the tee, Holmes ends up making bogey from the middle of the fairway. He can't get up and down from sand. And up on 15, I wonder whether the Lee Westwood fairytale has run its course? He nearly sends a tramliner into the cup for birdie, but the ball scoots six feet past, and he pushes the one coming back. A bogey, and suddenly he's five off the pace.</p>
      <p>-13: Lowry (14) -12: Fleetwood (15) -9: Rose (17), Holmes (14) -8: Fowler (F), Koepka (17), Westwood (15) -7: Willett (F), Rahm (F), Finau (F), Spieth (17)</p>

      <p>Spieth makes another birdie, this time at 17. He's suddenly -7, and another down 18 would ask a couple of questions of the leaders coming in. Not that Lowry or Fleetwood look in the mood to buckle. Fleetwood's second into 15 kicks off down a bank to the right, but he chips up to four feet and scrambles his par. Lowry does pretty much the same from front-left of 14. This is wonderful golf.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.58pm BST</p>
      <p>Some of Rose's good work comes undone at 16, as he yips a short par putt and drops back to -9. Back on 14, Lowry flays a disgrace of a drive deep into Puntersville down the left. He screams "fore!" - Kyle Stanley take note - but it still hits some poor bugger. Fortunately so, for Lowry anyway, as his ball was whistling towards some real nonsense. And now he can knock his second near the green, giving himself a chance of salvaging par. Meanwhile from the centre of the fairway, Holmes pulls his approach into sand on the left. He's been scrappy for a while, and now he's beginning to pay the price. Back-to-back bogeys are on the cards for Holmes here.</p>

      <p>A wonderful second into 14 by Fleetwood, straight over the flag. It sets up a 12-foot birdie putt. His effort looks in, but slips by on the right at the last. Then back on 13, JB Holmes finds the heart of the green, overhits his long birdie effort, and can't tidy up coming back from four feet. He slips back to -10 again. Meanwhile beard enthusiast Roger Kirkby (6.18pm) argues that Henrik Stenson won the Open in 2016 with a beard. You can see his point... but that's not a beard. That's stubble. My blog, my rules.

Bogey, and at -7 his hopes of a first Claret Jug are beginning to look a little slim. Meanwhile birdie for Tony Finau at the last - chipping in from the swale Rory McIlroy found himself last night - and amid huge cheers he signs for a 68! He's -7 going into Sunday.</p>

      <p>Poor old Jon Rahm watches in horror as a 25-foot par effort on 18 stops one dimple short of the cup. He waits as long as he can, in the hope of the grass wilting, or a small breeze nudging his ball in, but eventually has to tap home the shortest shot. Even so, that's a lovely 68. At -7 he's probably a little too far back, unless the leaders have a collective breakdown coming in. A level-par 71 for Patrick Reed, incidentally, who remains stalled at -4.</p>

      <p>Holmes leaves a chip from the swale a good ten feet short. So he does extremely well to knock in the birdie putt he's left himself, and keep pace with Lowry, who nearly drains his eagle effort but makes his own bird and regains sole ownership of the lead. Meanwhile Rose blooters a drive down 15 and eases a wedge pin high to eight feet. A great chance to move a little closer to the leading bunch... and in it goes!</p>

      <p>Lowry's second into 12 lands pin high, 30 feet to the left. Holmes hoicks his approach another 20 feet left of Lowry, into a small depression. Meanwhile both Fleetwood and Westwood send their tee shots on the par-three 13th into the heart of the green. They're not really birdie chances, though, and the pair stay at -12 and -9 respectively. Meanwhile a birdie for Jordan Spieth at 15, and he's -6, looking to salvage his Open hopes with a strong finish.</p>

      <p>Lowry's drive at the par-five 12th flirts with the big bunker down the right of the fairway. But his ball just evades the camber that'd funnel him into the trap. Holmes larrups one drown the track too. Up on the green, Fleetwood makes a fairly fuss-free birdie to join Lowry in the lead. And you may have noticed Rahm popping up on the leaderboard at -8. That's thanks to a 15-foot slider holed at 17, his third birdie in four holes. Cameron Smith follows the lead of Justin Rose, making eagle at 12 then birdie at 13. And Brooks Koepka ensures he stays in touch, responding to his first dropped shot in 27 holes by immediately bouncing back with birdie at 14!. This really is magnificent knockabout entertainment!</p>

Xander Schauffele parred the last couple of holes, ending up with a 69 that promised more. He's -5. Justin Harding has made back-to-back bogeys at 11 and 12 to slip to -5. And an eighth par in a row for JB Holmes, who turns down another birdie chance at 11. He's still a couple behind Lowry, who pars the hole without too much drama.</p>

Meanwhile here's Roger Kirkby: "With a lot of facial growth on the leaderboard today, and growing up not remembering many winners with a beard, a trivia question for ya. Who was the first guy to win a major after 1960 with a beard?" Funnily enough, I looked into this yesterday afternoon, with reference to the Open anyway. So please let me repeat myself. [cuts, pastes] There hasn't been a bearded winner of the Open since 1882, when Bob Ferguson took the title at St Andrews sporting an extremely wide goatee. No sides or moustache though, and a lack of hair on the upper lip might irk some purists. So with Willie Park Sr. (1875, Prestwick) similarly disqualified for lack of tache, despite having a dead sheep glued to his chin, we have to go right back to 1867, when Old Tom Morris triumphed at Prestwick with the full Santa arrangement.</p>

And Justin Rose whips his tee shot at the par-three 13th to eight feet, and follows up his eagle with birdie. Nothing much was happening for north Hampshire's finest, but now look!

      <p>One of the shots of the day by Shane Lowry! He's sent his drive into the rough to the left of 10. A spot of trouble. But a little local knowledge goes a long way, and after discussion with his caddie, he powers an iron from 200 yards off the bank to the left of the green, the ball rolling dutifully right to ten feet! That is masterful links golf, and the crowd respond in the manner the shot deserves. Holmes, from the centre of the fairway, seems spooked and sends a hot second over the back of the green. He's on the fringe, but it's not clear he has a direct route to the flag because of the green's undulations. He might have to take a wedge, a la Gary Woodland on 17 at Pebble Beach last month.</p>

You'd hope the golfing gods allow him to make it, because he was very honest during a discussion with the rules official. His ball was embedded, which would have allowed him a free drop, but only if he would have played the ball from where it was. He honestly said no, he'd have taken an unplayable, so that took precedence and it meant a one-stroke penalty. Fleetwood meanwhile screeches his second to 12 feet.</p>

But he can't make the putt, the ball bending off to the left at the last. That's a wee shame, but you can bet your bottom euro he'd have taken a 65 at the start of Moving Day. He goes into Sunday at -7. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler wedges his second at 15 to six feet, and makes a birdie that takes him to -7. And Tommy Fleetwood, thanks to two big bashes that send his ball to the front edge of the par-five 7th, makes a simple birdie that gives him a share.</p>

      <p>Danny Willett crashes his drive at 18 down the centre of the fairway. If he makes a birdie here, he'll post a new course record of 64. (Rory McIlroy's celebrated 61 was on the old configuration of this course.) He's in the perfect spot to go for it. Par threes for Lowry and Holmes at 6. Trouble for Justin Rose at 8, though: off line with his tee shot, two poor chips, and the bogey takes him back to -6.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.00pm BST</p>
      <p>While Holmes was scrabbling about, Lowry found the green at 5 in two, setting up a ten-foot birdie chance. In it goes, and he reclaims a share of the lead! A huge roar. Holmes follows him in for par, a fine scramble that's celebrated by some lovely partisan silence. But there's another loud whoop over on 17, where Danny Willett chips to four feet and makes his sixth birdie of the day! He rises to -7 and a tie for fifth! But it's a first bogey since Thursday for Xander Schauffele, at 14, and he slips to -6.</p>
      <p>-10: Westwood (6), Lowry (5), Holmes (5) -9: Fleetwood (6) -7: Willett (17), Finau (10), Koepka (7), Rose (7)</p>

      <p>Holmes takes his free drop at 5, to the left of the scoreboard. But though he's got an improved lie, he's still in the cabbage. And there's that OB just over the green. So it's no surprise that he doesn't commit to his chip, and his ball lands apologetically short of the green, still in the thick rough. He clips his second effort very nicely to eight feet, and he's got a great chance of scrambling par. Meanwhile an easy two-putt birdie for Brooks Koepka on 7; he's -7.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.52pm BST</p>
      <p>Lee Westwood: magician. He bashes a delicate chip into the bank front-right of him, sending his ball arcing up onto the green, flying back a little leftwards towards the cup. It gently stops at par-saving distance. His partner Tommy Fleetwood nearly drains a 60-footer for an outrageous birdie. But par will do for him as well. Meanwhile Tony Finau is slowly mooching up the standings. He turns in 33, after birdies at 2, 5 and now 9, the latest reward for an approach sent to ten feet. He's -7. And it's back-to-back birdies for Tyrrell Hatton, at 10 and 11, and he's -6, far from out of this!</p>

      <p>Uh-oh, JB. He sends a huge slice into thick filth to the right of 5. As his ball curves hysterically through the air, he must be seriously worried about losing it. But what a huge break! It does indeed land in disgraceful rubbish... but he's right behind a scoreboard, so he'll get relief from there. What could have been disaster appears to have been averted. But there'll be tricky times for Westwood up on the par-three 6th. He nearly hits the perfect tee shot, straight at the flag. Nearly. But it's swallowed up by a little run-off which takes his ball down a steep, furry swale. That'd be a tricky chip if the flag was on the other side of the green, but he's shortsided. God speed, Lee Westwood.</p>

      <p>Fleetwood is the width of a cigarette paper away from eagle on 5. He sends his tee shot just short of the green, then crisply chips up the bank, his ball kissing the left lip but refusing to drop. He taps in for birdie and moves to -9, a shot off Westwood and Holmes' lead. Westy can only chip up to 20 feet, and he's left with a putt that breaks violently from left to right. Too much to ask. Just the par. And it's pars for Holmes and Lowry back on 4.</p>

      <p>Justin Harding's hot chip at 5 costs him a double. He clatters down the standings to -6. A wonderful fast start was all for nought. "Lee Westwood leading! He couldn't, could he? Let's make sure. Someone throw Stewart Cink into the boot of a car and start driving, now!" Hubert O'Hearn there, with advice that comes ten years too late for poor old Tom Watson.</p>

      <p>Robert Peston Dylan Frittelli is one of those players at -6. He's got there in a very roundabout way. Birdie at 2, double at 4, and now an eagle at 7, sending a two-bounce wedge into the cup from 100 yards! Justin Rose meanwhile nearly drains a monster on 6 for birdie but has to settle for a par; he remains at -7.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.32pm BST</p>
      <p>Disaster for Justin Harding at 5, as his chip into the green takes a flyer. It bounds through the green, and settles in the dry moat running behind. That's OB. Bogey for Jordan Spieth at 6, and he slips back to -6. But it's three birdies in a row for Lee Westwood, who splits the fairway at 4, wedges to 15 feet, then rolls in the putt! A fairytale in the making here. Imagine if the eternal bridesmaid finally catches the bouquet!</p>

      <p>Rickie Fowler's stealthy creep up the leaderboard continues apace! It's back-to-back birdies, the latest at 11, and he's -6. There's no bigger student of links golf, and there'd be no more popular winner than the likeable Californian. Well, OK, maybe Shane Lowry has dibs on that. And speaking of the big man... he lands his tee shot at the par-three 3rd just to the right of the cup. One bounce past, and he nearly spins it back for an ace! He'll surely make birdie from a couple of feet.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.21pm BST</p>
      <p>Lee Westwood takes sole ownership of the lead after clacking his tee shot at the par-three 3rd to six feet! What a start for the major-championship nearly man! He's -9. Though he's soon joined there by JB Holmes, who sends a delightfully judged putt up the swale and across the warped 2nd green, his ball stopping 18 inches to the left of the hole. Shane Lowry has to make do with par, after chipping up from further out and taking a couple of putts. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Harding, who bundles his second into 4 off the camber to the right of the green, and strokes home a left-to-right putt from eight feet.</p>
      <p>-9: Westwood (3), Holmes (2) -8: Harding (4), Fleetwood (3), Lowry (2) -7: Schauffele (11), Spieth (5), Rose (4)</p>

      <p>Justin Rose with a sensational par save on 4! He's always out of position, down the left of the hole, but rakes in a 40-footer to remain at -7. That'll feel nice and tingly, and he celebrates accordingly. Plenty of support from the gallery too. His partner Brooks Koepka misses a 12-footer for birdie. He's not been confident with the flat stick all week. There was footage of him on the practice green the other day, yipping one from Rory-at-16 distance, suggesting something's nagging away at him. Could it be his Achilles heel this week? He's only two off the lead at -6, so probably not.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.12pm BST</p>
      <p>There's not been much backwards movement among the leading players. But here's something: Cameron Smith misses a tiddler on 3 and slips back to -6. Meanwhile neither of the final pair can find the par-five 2nd in two. Both tug their approaches down the swale to the left. Lowry in particular is left with a puzzle, as his ball rolls into a divot amid the semi-rough.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.09pm BST</p>
      <p>It's three birdies in four holes for Xander Schauffele. He's not dropped a shot since Thursday afternoon, and he's -7. Meanwhile news of Rickie Fowler, who has evaded the radar for most of the week despite plodding along nicely. An early bogey today at 4, but he's since responded with birdies at 5, 7 and 10, and at -5 is just three off the lead. Birdie at the par-three 3rd for Justin Harding, meanwhile, thanks to a lovely tee shot to ten feet. And nearly an eagle for Lee Westwood at 2! He tidies up for birdie, and joins the leaders! This is such a great leaderboard.</p>
      <p>-8: Westwood (2), Fleetwood (2), Lowry (1), Holmes (1) -7: Schauffele (10), Spieth (4), Rose (3), Harding (3), Smith (2) -6: Park (14), Willett (13), Stenson (9), Finau (6), Koepka (3) -5: Fowler (10), Noren (8), Kuchar (7)</p>

      <p>The wind that had been forecast simply hasn't arrived. Hence the birdie blitzes all across the course. Can either of the final pair make one at the opening hole? JB Holmes has apparently quickened up his game since copping for plenty of abuse regarding his glacial pace of play. Apparently. Having failed to get his approach close, he takes an absolute age to work out the long putt, and the speed of his ball matches the speed of his decision-making process. It's well short. But he rams in a six-footer to scramble his par. Just. His ball thought about staying up for a second there. Lowry, working at ten times the pace, knocks a medium-length birdie putt to kick-in distance. A pair of pars.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 3.58pm BST</p>
      <p>Away from the hubbub at the 1st... hubbub elsewhere! Birdies for Henrik Stenson at 8, Park Sang-hyun at 14, and Tony Finau at 4. All rise to -6. Another one for Justin Thomas, too, and he's up to -5. And Cameron Smith birdies 2 to join Spieth, Rose and Westwood at -7.</p>

      <p>An ovation that would rattle your fillings at the first tee, as Ireland's Shane Lowry takes to the stage. He sends a slightly nervous iron towards the thick stuff down the right, but the ball takes a kind bounce left and sits up in the semi. JB Holmes splits the fairway with his tee shot. More bedlam. And if the final pairing didn't already know that things have suddenly got very real, up on the green Tommy Fleetwood begins his charge with an opening birdie, ramming in a right-to-left 20-foot slider. Almost immediately, Southport's finest grabs himself a share of the lead!</p>

Meanwhile birdies for Jordan Spieth at 3, and Justin Rose at 2, whisk that pair up to -7, one shy of JB Holmes and Shane Lowry's 36-hole mark. And right on cue, here come the leaders. They'll tee off with the breath of the chasing pack on their necks. A chasing pack that now contains a certain Brooks Koepka, who nearly made eagle at 2.</p>
      <p>-8: Holmes, Lowry -7: Spieth (3), Rose (2), Fleetwood, Westwood -6: Willett (12), Schauffele (8), Frittelli (3), Koepka (2), Harding (1), Smith (1)</p>

      <p>A very disappointing back nine carded by Shubhankar Sharma. The young Indian prospect turned in level-par 36, but made five bogeys in the next six holes, and ended up signing for a 77. He clatters down the standings to +6. Not a great day for last year's final-day hero Eddie Pepperell, either. A hungover 67 gave him the clubhouse lead for a while, and eventually a share of sixth, and there's a fair chance he'll be hitting the pop on Saturday evening again. A decent start today, with birdie at 2, but six subsequent bogeys led to a 76. He's +5.</p>

      <p>An's first slip of the day. A bogey at 9, the result of a yipped tiddler. But he's still turning round in 33. He's -5. Heading the other way: Xander Schauffele, who rolls in a 15-footer on 8 for back-to-back birdies. How he'll wish he configured his driver properly on Thursday morning, before running up that out-of-whack 75. He's -6. And the Californian is joined there by Jordan Spieth of nearby Texas, who picks up a stroke at the generous par-five 2nd.</p>

      <p>Dylan Frittelli is bidding to become the first man to win the Open wearing spectacles since Ian Baker-Finch in 1991. (David Duval's sunglasses in 2001 don't count.) The 29-year-old South African wears thick brims; imagine a less-flustered version of ITV political editor Robert Peston, and there you have it. Frittelli's in hot form after winning last week's John Deere to earn his place here, and he nearly drains a monster eagle putt at 2. He's so unfortunate as his ball breaks just to the left during the last turn of a 70-foot journey. But he joins the lads at -6.</p>

He's only hit an average of one in three fairways so far! He's the first player today to join the group at -6. Birdie for Schauffele at 7; he joins the popular -5 gang. And a little more detail on Willett's birdie at 10: he benefited from a massive break, as he sent his approach towards the grassy banks on the left, only for his ball to twang back into the heart of the green and stop a few feet from the flag. Hey, take your luck when it comes.</p>

      <p>Alex Noren has started well. Birdies at 2 and 4, and the 37-year-old Swede, who finished in a tie for sixth at Birkdale a couple of years ago, joins the ever-growing group at -5. The latter birdie is seriously fortuitous, as he batters a long putt from the fringe with far too much conviction. Had the hole - and the flagstick - not got in the way, that ball was sailing off the other side of the green. Reward for laser-guided accuracy, I guess, but Noren has the good grace to blow out hard in the theatrical style. He's joined at -5 by Jon Rahm, who nearly makes an eagle putt from the side of 2, but settles for his par.</p>

His partner Webb Simpson, the 2012 US Open champion, matches him shot for shot. And they're both joined at -5 by An Byeong-hun, who solves another putting puzzle at 5. This one is from 20 feet, but over a hump jutting in from the left, causing issues of both line and pace. He solves both as his ball kicks right and drops into the cup at perfect weight. Also: another birdie for Danny Willett, reward for his sending his second shot at 8 to 12 feet and guiding in the gentle right-to-left slider. With the wind down, it's all happening again!</p>

Full of fresh confidence, the 27-year-old South Korean - a former British PGA champion at Wentworth (2015) - is going along nicely today. He's followed up birdie at 2 with another at 4, the latter thanks to a 30-foot wonder putt from the fringe at the back of the green, the ball taking a 90-degree right-turn halfway along its route to the cup. He's -4. Meanwhile birdies for Henrik Stenson and Webb Simpson at 2, and they move to -4 too.</p>

Willett was in the final pairing on Sunday in 2015, though weather delays meant that was only the third round. Still, he ended the week tied for sixth, his best performance at the Open. He's coming off the back of a tie for 12th at last month's US Open, his highest finish in a major since winning at Augusta, so confidence should be replenished after a couple of barren, injury-hit years.

      <p>Thanks David! Back just in time to see Xander Schauffele tee it up. The 25-year-old from San Diego shot a bogey-free 65 yesterday, more than making up for Thursday's surprisingly below-standard 75. Turns out he had to turn in his driver earlier in the week, as it didn't meet with strict R&amp;A regulations. He wasn't too fond of the first replacement, and his driving accuracy for the first round was miserable, hitting only 43% of fairways, a poor show compared to the field average of 61%. But he tinkered on the range afterwards, and yesterday found a better fit, hitting 93% of the fairways, the best in show, especially when you compare it to the 57% average of the entire field. The ten-shot difference in his two rounds, right there. Anyway, he's found the fairway with his first drive today, leading to an opening par. More of yesterday's antics today, and one of the pre-tournament favourites will be right back in it come tomorrow.</p>

American pair Lucas Glover and Patrick Cantlay could be the first to make inroads as both are -3 for the tournament and -2 for the day after back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3. Glover, the 2009 US Open champion, is enjoying his best season for some time while Cantlay recently moved into the world's top ten after a thrilling win at the Memorial Tournament. He started the final round there four shots behind the leader but won by two thanks to an 8-under 64 so if you're scribbling notes next to the runners and riders in the current top 20, pencil in "likes a final-day charge" next to Cantlay.</p>

      <p>Four players shot 6-under 65s in Friday's second round although, as one of them was Rory McIlroy, only three will get the chance to pull off that most difficult of feats: going low one day and following it up with another good 'un the next. The three remaining members of the 65 gang are Americans Xander Schauffele and Kevin Streelman, and South African Justin Harding. Streelman is already reeling a little after playing his first eight holes in +2 while Harding and Schauffele, T5 and T18 respectively, are yet to tee off.</p>

      <p>We're often spun the line that starting the last 36 holes seven, eight or even nine shots back at an Open is no impossible hurdle, especially given the vagaries of the British weather. The concept of a weekend charge is compelling but, unfortunately, there's not a great deal of truth in it. Starting from Tom Lehman's victory at Lytham in 1996 and there are just two examples of winners starting the final two rounds outside the top 15. Francesco Molinari was tied 29 th and six back before coming through to win at Carnoustie last year while David Duval sat tied 35 th after two days of frustration at Lytham in 2001 before turning on the afterburners and hoisting the Claret Jug. Duval was seven behind at halfway, as was Ernie Els when Red Rum to Adam Scott's Crisp, again at Lytham in 2012. Outliers offer hope at least and, as I say that, Justin Thomas (currently seven back) pings a tee shot off the first tee. Could he be this year's weekend charger?</p>

      <p>Still a wee while before Shane Lowry walks on to the first tee (3:50pm) and ramps up the decibel levels. In the meantime, let's head to stats corner for some clues on how the Irishman might perform today. There are no guarantees - especially in these unique circumstances - but the good news is that Lowry has a strong record as a front-runner. He's held the 36-hole lead/joint-lead five times in his European/PGA Tour career and never gone on to finish worse than third from such a position. Twice he converted those leads in to silverware, the first in his famous win as a 500/1 amateur in the 2009 Irish Open and the second when going wire-to-wire in this year's Abu Dhabi Championship. On the other three occasions, he finished just a single shot behind the winner in both the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and Wales Open in 2014 while he ended two back at this year's RBC Heritage at Hilton Head in South Carolina after entering the weekend on pole. Yep, he's made of solid stuff the Irishman. After two days of excellence, there's good reason to expect continuation not capitulation.</p>

      <p>Thanks Scott. Walking Netflix box-set series, Doc Redman, and Kiwi Ryan Fox still have the best rounds going today. Both are 3-under for the day, Redman sitting at 3-under for the championship after seven holes of his third lap and Fox -2 overall after 10 holes. Redman is tied 18 th and Fox tied 26 th but there's still a sense that we're watching the support acts before the headliners come on.</p>

      <p>Other than Doc Redman, who is three under for his round through the first six holes, nobody's making huge inroads today. The wind's up, and Portrush is a much more testing proposition. But in any conditions, quality will out, and the defending champion Francesco Molinari creams his second at 14 to 12 inches, and makes birdie. That was a sensational approach at the hardest hole on the course. Much as you'd expect for a man who won his Claret Jug at Carnoustie, the toughest test of all. Though he'll not be matching Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington as a 21st-century back-to-back winner: he's +2.</p>

      <p>Another birdie for Portrush hero Graeme McDowell. He follows up the one he made on 11 with another at the par-five 12th. He's -1, and must be turning over the tatty denouement to his opening round again and again in his mind. That 5-3-5-7 finish cost him five precious strokes, the difference between simply performing at the weekend, and being right in the mix. Still, look at Darren and Rory, it could be a lot worse.</p>

      <p>Willebrordus Adrianus Maria Luiten - also known as Joost, to the blessed relief of live bloggers around the world - started out as a ski jumper. But he had a bad fall as a ten-year-old, breaking both elbow and nose, and so transferred his talents to the meat golf. Winter sport's loss is golf's gain, and the 33-year-old Dutchman has started out today with birdies at 2 and 5. He's -2, currently tied for 27th and well placed to beat his Open Championship best finish of tied-44 at Birkdale two years ago.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.40pm BST</p>
      <p>The Doc is made of the proper stuff. He sends his tee shot at the par-three 6th bounding down a deep swale at the back left of the green. He does pretty well to lob up to 15 feet, though the par putt's far from certain. But he knocks it in nervelessly. He's been taking breathing exercises to control the jitters. They seem to be working. He remains at -3, forward momentum brilliantly maintained.</p>

      <p>Back-to-back birdies for Kevin Kisner. A textbook no-frills amble up the par-five 2nd and he's -3. Doc Redman opts not to attack the pin at the big-risk-and-reward 5th; he wisely wedges short of the flag, taking the OB behind out of play, and cradles up a putt. Par. He remains at -3 alongside Kisner. And Ryan Fox, who had bogeyed 6 since we last heard of him today, takes the shot back at 8 with a lovely 20-foot right-to-left curler. He's -1 again.</p>

      <p>A birdie for G-Mac on 11. He curls a lovely right-to-left 25-footer into the cup. He's level par now, in credit for his round today, having earlier birdied 2 and bogeyed 6. The home crowd, momentarily stunned by Rory's doomed comeback and Darren Clarke's last-gasp capitulation yesterday, find their voice again. Hear them roar.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.18pm BST</p>
      <p>Another long putt sunk by the Doc! Redman rattles it in from 30 feet at 4, and that's three birdies in a row! He's -3. Last year's joint runner-up Kevin Kisner opens with birdie to move immediately to -2. And on 5, with the pin tucked towards the back of the green and the wind whipping towards the sea, Kyle Stanley hits an overly aggressive second that rolls through and out of bounds. No spectators standing there, so at least that's something. He tries again, wedging to 12 feet. Two putts later, that's a double bogey, and all his early gains have been lost. He's level par again.</p>

      <p>Now then, Doc Redman. Doc's not a nickname, it's on his birth certificate. (Dr Golf, a mere fictional confection of the HBH, is beyond jealous.) Redman's parents were certainly creative; his sister is called Karma. Anyway, the 21-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina looks the real deal. He's been playing since the age of three, golf one of his two passions along with calculus. He's been known to hit over a thousand putts a day to groove in his stroke; how many equations he solves per week isn't on record. Anyway, Redman shot 62 in a qualifier to reach the recent inaugural Rocket Mortgage Classic, then went on to grab second place and with it a spot in the Open. He's admitted to suffering from nerves in the past, most notably when he teed it up at the Masters last year, missing the cut, but he's looking in control this week. Back-to-back birdies this morning at 2 and 3, the latter the reward for a 40-foot tramliner, and he's -2.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.55am BST</p>
      <p>Now Stanley does extremely well to get up and down from the bottom of a bank at the par-three 3rd, after a weak tee shot. A decent chip up to 15 feet, then a brilliant putt to scramble. He remains at -2. Meanwhile birdies at 2 for a couple of English stars in Eddie Pepperell and Paul Casey, both men rising to -1. And it's a fast start by this week's record breaker, Ryan Fox. The Kiwi played the back nine in 29 strokes on Thursday, the best figures in Open history. Now he's opened today with birdies at 2 and 5. He's -1. Just to say, he could go on to birdie 6, 8 and 9, and eagle 5, and even then he'd be a shot shy of Denis Durnian's front-nine Open record of 28, set at Birkdale in 1983. But one rewriting of the history books is enough, let's not get greedy.</p>

      <p>Philosophy corner. Yesterday's dialectical discourse between Robert MacIntyre and Kyle Stanley - in which the young Scot posited a thesis suggesting it's advisable to shout "fore!" when you spray a shot towards the gallery, the American reacting with an antithesis of "bugger off", synthesis as yet unpublished - seems to have lit a fire under the latter. Stanley very nearly makes eagle at 2, but settles for a kick-in birdie that whisks him up to -2. He's now in a tie for 25th, just six shots off the lead jointly held by JB Holmes and Shane Lowry. It's a bunched leaderboard all right.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.40am BST</p>
      <p>But here's another: Benjamin Hebert birdies 2 to rise to -1 for the championship. The 32-year-old Frenchman - it's the 20th anniversary of Jean van de Velde's heroic failure, by the way - is in hot form. He qualified for the Open only last week, after shooing a final round of 62 at the Scottish Open to make a play-off with Bernd Wiesberger. He lost that face-off at the third extra hole, but it meant he was teeing it up at the Open for only the second time. He missed the cut at Birkdale in 2008, shooting 79-73 as an amateur. This time he's going along very nicely. Throw in the biggest paycheck of his career last week, and it's been a fine few days for M. Hebert.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.30am BST</p>
      <p>Birdie for Stanley on 1! Go Kyle! Go Kyle! A lovely 20-footer rolled across the green after a pin-high approach. He moves into red figures at -1. Stanley hasn't done much in the majors; the 31-year-old from Washington state's best finish is a tie for 21st at this year's Masters. He's probably more famous for his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Phoenix Open in 2012, making up eight shots in the final round to win, a week after shipping a six-shot final-round lead of his own at the Farmers Insurance Open. Only in sport, huh. Sadly the aforementioned Tom Lewis follows up his eagle at 2 with bogey at 3, and slips back to level par. So now Stanley is the only one of the morning starters in red figures for this year's tournament.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.20am BST</p>
      <p>A warm reception on the first tee for Kyle Stanley. Whether he deserves such blanket respect may be a moot point, given he fired two shots into the gallery yesterday, failing to shout fore on both occasions. His second wild one hit the mother of playing partner Robert MacIntyre's caddie, leading to a full and frank exchange of views in the scorer's hut later on. Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of judgement on Stanley's part; we all have off days. Hopefully he'll learn from it. However, it's a good sign for Scottish golf, so long in the doldrums, that the 22-year-old prospect from Oban has the nerve to stand his ground with an established pro during his rookie season on Tour.</p>

      <p>It's been a long time since Tom Lewis made a name for himself by leading the Open as a 20-year-old amateur. That was 2011, when he shot an opening 65 at Sandwich, the lowest round by an amateur in Open history. It made him the first amateur to lead the Open since the renowned Michael Bonallack managed it back in 1968. One of Lewis's playing partners that day was the five-time winner Tom Watson, after whom he was named. Lewis finished the week tied 30th as low amateur, the Silver Medal hanging around his neck. Such a shame one won't be awarded this week, with no amateur making the cut. Anyway, Lewis has since turned pro, with a couple of victories on the European Tour to his name, both at the Portugal Masters, in 2011 and 2018. He's belatedly delivering on his early promise, with a notable upturn in form during the last couple of years. And he's eagled 2 this morning, sending a magnificent second shot to four feet, to become the first of the early starters to make it into red figures. He's -1 for the tournament.</p>

      <p>Good morning Ulster. News to follow, but let's start with the weather. It's a lovely sunny day on the Antrim coast. The beautiful Dunluce links of Portrush shining in all its glory and splendour. It looks as though the sun will be out for most of the day. Some cloud in the afternoon perhaps. And there's not a huge likelihood of rain. If we get any, it'll be later in the afternoon and/or early evening, and not particularly heavy. But while Portrush's defences were totally down yesterday, the conditions still, the breeze is expected to pick up today. Gusts of up to 25mph at some points. As a result, the chances of a repeat of round two's across-the-board low scoring aren't super-high. Then again, these are the world's top golfers we're talking about. Also, Shane Lowry was out in the worst of yesterday's weather, and he still went out in 31. So let's assume nothing. Onward!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.21am BST</p>
      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>If the first two days of the 148th Open Championship are anything to go by, the weekend is going to be a heady Portrush rush. Look at the drama we've already been served up: a hole-in-one for Emiliano Grillo; a nonuple-bogey 14 for David Duval; a record-breaking back-nine 29 for Ryan Fox; an opening quadruple-bogey for pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy, who'd go on to miss a putt from 12 inches on his way to a 79; a 78 for Tiger; a triple-bogey capitulation at the 18th that cost local hero Darren Clarke his weekend participation; an Irish charge by Shane Lowry; the late-career renaissance of Lee Westwood; and 65s for Xander Schauffele, Justin Harding and... Rory McIlroy, who fell one stroke short of a comeback for the ages.</p>
      <p>And there are still two whole days to go! With so many big names on the shoulder of leaders Shane Lowry and JB Holmes, today won't just be about moving. The way things have been going, it'll also feature some grooving, shaking, rattling, rolling, bumping, grinding, twerking, the twist, the hitchhike, the watusi and the mashed potato. The only downside is the lack of a Silver Medal battle, no amateurs having survived the cut. Ah well, we can't have it all. It's still on. Moving Day is on. It's on!</p>

      <title>How the NFL still treats doping almost as seriously as domestic violence</title>
      <subtitle>The NFL's eight-game suspension for Kareem Hunt for assaulting a woman is a step in the right direction. But only by the standards the NFL has set itself</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The NFL handed Kareem Hunt an eight-game suspension 10 days ago, after concluding its investigation into the running back's involvement in a fight at a resort last June. The league was forced into action after TMZ released video footage showing Hunt pushing a woman to the floor and then kicking her, before being held back by two other men. Hunt was not arrested and did not face charges for his actions. In its statement, the NFL said the ban was also in connection with "physical altercations" at Hunt's residence last February.</p>
      <p>The eight-game ban is significant as it's the first time the NFL has punished a player by more than the "baseline suspension" of six games as stipulated in its Player Conduct Policy for first-time offenders, which it updated in December 2014. Before the NFL ruled on Hunt, the average suspension for first-time offenders of domestic violence, assault, child abuse or sexual abuse had been 3.7 games, since the league updated its policy after its botched handling of the Ray Rice scandal in 2014.</p>
      <p>The NFL handed Rice, another star running back at the time, a paltry two-game suspension after it was reported that Rice had struck his then fiancée (they are now married) in an elevator of an Atlantic City casino. After TMZ published a video of Rice dragging an unconscious body out of the elevator, the NFL suspended him indefinitely.</p>
      <p>In an email to the Guardian, the NFL said that it makes every effort to obtain relevant video, but does not pay for information. Reacting to videos has become a recurring activity for the NFL.</p>
      <p>The NFL said it learned a tremendous amount in 2014, and five years on from Rice, the league has made positive steps in reducing violence and abuse within its league. With Hunt, the NFL made arguably its boldest statement yet. However, in the 20 domestic violence, assault, child abuse and sexual abuse cases since Rice and preceding Hunt, the NFL failed to adhere to its own policy on several occasions. While the NFL states that mitigating factors can reduce the severity of punishment, the average suspension for first-time offenders of the league's Performance Enhancing Substances and Substances of Abuse policies is 3.5 games, almost identical to the average player conduct suspension. The NFL did maintain that some of the cases in 2015 occurred before the new policy was implemented.</p>
      <p>2015: seven players banned for abuse, assault or violence at average of 3.4 games</p>
      <p>The highest profile domestic violence ruling of 2015 involved former Pro Bowler Greg Hardy, who was arrested for allegedly strangling his ex-girlfriend, Nicole Holder, throwing her on a couch covered in firearms and threatening to kill her. The charges were eventually dropped after his accuser failed to show up to testify.</p>
      <p>Hardy played in the Carolina Panthers' opening game of the 2014 season, but did not play again that year after he was placed on Goodell's exempt list. Knowing a lengthy suspension was probable, the Dallas Cowboys signed Hardy to a one-year contract anyway on 18 March.</p>
      <p>On 22 April, the NFL suspended Hardy 10 games for "sufficient credible evidence" that his actions violated the league's policies. But, an appeal led by the NFL Players Association led to the ban being reduced to four games. Neutral arbitrator Harold Henderson said "The egregious conduct exhibited here is indefensible in the NFL. However, 10 games is simply too much, in my view, of an increase over prior cases without notice such as was done last year, when the 'baseline' for discipline in domestic violence or sexual assault cases was announced as a six-game suspension."</p>
      <p>Hardy played 12 games in the 2015 season, and hasn't been signed by another team since his deal with the Cowboys expired. He is now a mixed martial arts fighter.</p>
      <p>2016: two players banned for average of 3.5 games</p>
      <p>With the controversy of the Rice case still lingering, the NFL bungled yet another domestic violence case, when it handed former New York Giants kicker Josh Brown a one-game suspension for abusing his ex-wife.</p>
      <p>In banning Brown, who admitted in his personal journal to having physically, emotionally and verbally abused his ex-wife, for one game Goodell failed to adhere to his own domestic violence policy from 2014. Further entries in Brown's journal included him saying that he had viewed himself as God, and his ex-wife as his slave. A year later, the NFL suspended Brown an additional six games.</p>
      <p>2017: three players banned for average of six games</p>
      <p>All three of the suspensions for domestic violence handed out by the NFL in 2017 met the six-game baseline.</p>
      <p>The suspended players included Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliot, of whom the NFL found "substantial and persuasive evidence" of physical altercations with his then-girlfriend; Michael Bowie of the New York Giants, who police stated grabbed his girlfriend by the neck and threw her to the ground during an argument; and Atlanta Hawks defensive end Ra'Shede Hageman, who pulled the hair of the mother of his child and pushed her down in the parking lot outside of her apartment, causing lacerations to her hand and elbow; and Josh Brown.</p>
      <p>2018: seven players banned for average of three games</p>
      <p>The NFL was back in the headlines when it once again failed to adhere to its own personal conduct policy, when Roger Goodell suspended Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston three games after concluding that Winston had touched an Uber driver in an inappropriate and sexual manner without her consent. In an email to the Guardian, the NFL said that the disciplinary action was appropriate and necessary.</p>
      <p>Baltimore Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith four games for his first domestic violence offense. The Ravens said Smith accepted full responsibility after the NFL found evidence of threatening and emotionally abusive behaviours aimed toward his former girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Additionally, former Seattle Seahawks quarterback Trevone Boykin was given a one-game suspension after he was arrested for an aggravated assault with serious bodily injury charge.</p>

      <p>Together for 52 years</p>
      <p>Barbara, 72, and Mick Wilson, 79, met in 1960 and married in 1962. Their eldest daughter, Sarah, died in a white-water rafting accident 14 years ago in Peru, when she was 36. Barbara is a neuropsychologist; Mick is a retired English teacher, and they live in Bury St Edmunds. They have two surviving children, Anna and Matthew, and four grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Barbara: I was in my first year at teacher-training college when Mick, in the year above, invited me to his room for coffee. "Mick Wilson never invites people for coffee," a friend told me. He gave me a large German beer mug full of Nescafe; I think he wanted to make a good impression.</p>
      <p>Mick thought we should wait to have children, but I decided we shouldn't. We were hippies: no TV, no car, we made our own bread. Mick had long hair and a beard and wore bell-bottoms. We had lots of cats and stick insects. I was a housewife, but Mick wanted me educated. I took my psychology A-level when I was 29, then a degree, a master's, and a PhD.</p>
      <p>In 2000, I was leaving work when a colleague said, "Mick's on his way over." I just knew something awful had happened. Maybe it's the cat, I thought. Please let it be the cat. Mick called from the motorway. "There's terrible news." Some part of me already knew. "Is it Sarah? Is she dead?" He said, "I think so."</p>
      <p>We somehow got through that night. Some kind of madness takes over. It's anguish, grief and everything in between. We took turns to be strong, I think. We talked and cried and held each other. We arranged to go out to Peru the following week and Mick paid £10,000 for a helicopter to look for Sarah's body. It was pointless, of course, but I knew he needed to do it, so I let him. Sarah has never been a taboo: we talk about her every day.</p>
      <p>Mick: It was always a strong marriage. We've done daft things, of course. Back in the old, hippy days we thought we wanted an open marriage, but we tried it once or twice and it didn't work out for us. It taught us both that the best kind of arousal comes through affection, not sex with just anyone.</p>
      <p>Our daughter Sarah's marriage had broken down after years of failed fertility treatments and she went to Peru to rethink her life. To this day, we've never had a body to bury. We won't ever have closure. You can learn to live with it, but you'll never close the book. I know many couples find their relationship can't survive this kind of loss, but ours did because we could always talk to each other and cry together.</p>
      <p>We are in our old age now and, the way we see it, we've lived a happy life, apart from one terrible tragedy. We have two wonderful children, and four grandchildren. To have the marriage we have, the life we have together, I think we've been very privileged.</p>
      <p>Together for 36 years</p>
      <p>Rod Marten, 71 (top), and Howard Shepherdson, 60, met in a pub in London in 1978. Rod is a retired tax inspector; Howard is a semi-retired management consultant. They were the UK's first same-sex couple to be legal long-term foster parents; their son, Glen, is 43. Rod and Howard have two grandchildren, and have been civil partners since 2005. They live in Ealing, west London.</p>
      <p>Howard: I had always thought the idea of love at first sight was a cliche. But one Thursday night in 1978, that's what happened. I spotted Rod at the bar and it was just lovely from the moment we started chatting. I went home to my parents in Sussex that weekend feeling quite delirious. I thought, "What is this?" It was like catching pneumonia.</p>
      <p>In 1985 I was a school counsellor and had been working with a 14-year-old boy, Glen, from a children's home. One day, Glen just asked me: "Will you be my dad?" I thought it was best to be honest with him, so I said I was afraid it was impossible, because I'm gay. Glen said, "Why should that matter?" And it struck a chord. Rod and I decided we might as well try. No gay couple had formally adopted - or long-term fostered, as we did - before. It was very strengthening, loving someone together and them loving you back. He now lives in France with his wife, Isabelle. We visit all the time, and Skype. Having grandchildren has been a deeply enriching experience for us.</p>
      <p>Rod and I are not at all independent of each other. We have no separate lives. We spend every day together and it never gets boring. Yes, sex does start to slow down at our age, but physical intimacy shouldn't. We still curl up on the sofa together, as we have done for ever. There's just one thing we avoid completely as it would mean instant divorce - DIY.</p>
      <p>Rod: When I went into work the day after I'd met Howard, a colleague said I seemed different, extra-happy. I was. We met in September and by December we were looking to buy a flat together. I think my family thought it was a bit soon, but we're still in the same flat, 36 years later.</p>
      <p>In the 80s, being openly gay on the street was not something you felt particularly secure doing. We've never walked around holding hands. If we were 21 now we'd do it, but you can't just start doing that in your 60s. Getting our civil partnership was a political statement, but as the date got closer, it felt very romantic.</p>
      <p>I think relationships need rules. Work must never dominate your life. We never go to sleep on an argument. I am a terrible procrastinator, and Howard is an over-organiser, but you have to learn to love the other person for who they are, and not be frustrated by what you want them to be. It's no good being perpetually disappointed. Our other absolute rule is that we never, ever eat dinner in front of the television. We haven't done it once in 36 years.</p>
      <p>Together for 40 years</p>
      <p>Jill Fanshawe Kato, 68, and Setsuo Kato, 72, met in London in the early 70s and married in Tokyo in 1974. They spent two years living in Japan before moving back to the UK and settling in north London. Setsuo is a freelance photojournalist; Jill is a potter.</p>
      <p>Jill: I had visited Japan in my 20s and found it a very chauvinistic place. But I'd got quite far with my Japanese and wanted to carry on learning, so I joined an evening class in Holborn. Setsuo turned up one night to interview students for an article that he was writing.</p>
      <p>Luckily for us, our families were very supportive. We had a traditional Japanese wedding in Tokyo. I wore a pink kimono with kanzashi hair ornaments.</p>
      <p>I think after all these years together, I have started looking a bit Japanese. I've always used kohl round my eyes, and I like to wear Japanese textiles. I suppose it's attitude and behaviour, too. I'm from Devon, but British people can never tell where I'm from.</p>
      <p>We never had children - perhaps that is the thing that has kept us together, and given us greater independence. We've both had admirers over the years, but we have got strong self-discipline. You need to be kind to each other, remember the value of what you have.</p>
      <p>There should always be an unknown area of your partner. There is a lot of mystery about Setsuo. We would never go to the loo in front of each other; there is privacy and respect between us. We've lived in this house for more than 30 years, but Setsuo has never once gone into my studio at the top of the house. We are probably still finding things out about each other, even now.</p>
      <p>Setsuo: Japanese men who travelled to London in those days were not mainstream - we were adventurous types. It wasn't as if you just hopped on a plane. I'd caught a Russian boat from Yokohama, and took the Siberian railway all the way to London.</p>
      <p>I have lived here a long time, but I always consider myself Japanese. I am not very good at being physically affectionate. I am a bit better at it than most Japanese men, but I don't talk about my feelings. I don't lose my temper.</p>
      <p>Jill and I give each other huge freedom. Jill will often go abroad for a month or two to work, and I enjoy a social life more than her - I zoom off and come back as I wish. We've always said we face the world back to back.</p>
      <p>I think you have to be patient. When life is down, people think changing partners will help - but I'm not convinced anyone is are better off in the long run. It would just be awful to have to start again.</p>
      <p>We are like two trees that have grown together; our roots are entwined.</p>
      <p>Together for 56 years</p>
      <p>Gem, 74, and Ezra Harris, 74, grew up in Glengoffe, a village in St Catherine, Jamaica. Ezra emigrated to England at 19, Gem followed him two months later, and they married in August 1958. They settled in Bradford. Ezra was a forklift driver and Gem worked in domestic service until they both retired. They have three children, Jennifer, 55, Christopher, 52 and Samantha, 45, and four grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Ezra: Back home, people used to talk about abroad as if the whole place was paved with gold. When a plane passed overhead we would all look up and wish we were on it. One day I heard an advertisement on the radio, saying you could come to Britain and get work. It was a promise of a future. I wanted to make myself better off and be somebody.</p>
      <p>I arrived in Bradford in June. It was supposed to be summer but I can remember the cold, the smell of the coal. The first day I was here, I felt like going back. You feel lonely; you miss your parents. I thought it would be much easier if I got a wife.</p>
      <p>Gem had been two years below me in church school. I didn't know anything about women. My father was a preacher and very strict. I wrote to her saying I'd like to send for her to come and marry me. I hoped she'd agree and she did - she was glad to come because I bought her a ticket out of Jamaica. I knew she would make a good wife.</p>
      <p>We didn't go back to Jamaica until 1973. Everything seemed different - smaller, farther away. It didn't feel like home. But still, after all this time, I can't get shot of my accent. Gem always tells me, "Speak English!" But you cannot teach an old dog new tricks.</p>
      <p>Fifty-six years we have been married. You must work at it. Talk to each other. Disagree, but don't let arguments drag on. Don't go around having lots of kids with women and not looking after them. And believe in God. If you trust in Him, everything is going to be all right.</p>
      <p>I try to be a good husband. I try not to come in with mucky hands. She worries about me passing first, and I tell her, "Don't worry about a thing." But if she goes first I will be miserable.</p>
      <p>We're going to go on a cruise, and when I booked it the lady asked if we would like separate beds. I said, "What are you talking about, woman?" We are husband and wife. Sometimes you still get some fun!</p>
      <p>Gem: I remember looking down from the plane as I flew into England for the first time, and seeing all this smoke coming from the chimneys. It looked as if the whole place was on fire.</p>
      <p>Even now, I don't know how I managed to get to Bradford alone. Ezra didn't come to meet me at the station - I am still angry with him about that - so I got a taxi to his lodgings. It was just a room, really, with a coal fire and a paraffin heater.</p>
      <p>I'd brought a wedding dress from home, and my mother's veil. I arrived on 12 August, and we married on 30 August in a register office. I missed my family very much at first, but you get used to it. The winters were hardest.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of racism back then. People would shout, "Go back to your dirty country!" They treated you as though you were nothing. It was hurtful, but you just try to keep away from trouble.</p>
      <p>Ezra calls me "the wife", which he shouldn't do. I'll tidy up the house and he'll go and leave crumbs. We quarrel every day, but we always make up.</p>
      <p>He likes to cuddle, but I don't bother. I am always telling him to talk properly, but when I get mad, I talk in patois: "Shuttup and come dung ere, man!" He just laughs.</p>
      <p>We have a good time. We used to love a drink and a dance at the African-Caribbean centre, listen to some reggae, some calypso - but it is upstairs and it's hard to get up there now with our bad knees. On Sundays I'll always cook Jamaican food for the family - curried goat, rice and peas, but always with yorkshire pudding, too.</p>
      <p>Together for 59 years</p>
      <p>Doreen, 89, and Patrick Skilling, 86, married in 1955. They lived in Notting Hill for 50 years; Patrick was an advertising executive and Doreen designed wallpaper for Biba. In the 70s, the couple gave up their jobs to run a furniture stall together in Portobello Market. Doreen was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2006 and they now live together at the Sunrise care home in Beaconsfield.</p>
      <p>Patrick: A colleague had been trying to take Doreen out. He said to me, "Take this bird out, will you? I can't handle her." So I took her for a drink. I was wildly impressed. We dated for five years and were married in the Queen's Chapel at the Savoy. It was way above our station, but Doreen somehow managed it.</p>
      <p>We always thought we would have children, but by the time we realised it probably wasn't going to happen, it was too late. We weren't sad about it at the time - it wasn't something we even talked about - but now I think it may have been the greatest tragedy of our lives. When I see Doreen cuddling a doll now, I wonder whether it may have affected her more than she let on, that there might be a deeper sense of loss.</p>
      <p>I was earning good money in advertising, smoking and drinking too much. I'm sorry to say I failed her many times; falling into the pitfalls that husbands do. But Doreen was always very patient. We decided I'd leave my job and we'd become business partners. So we took a stall in Portobello Market, and started selling antiques and junk furniture. It revitalised our married life. We had time to talk.</p>
      <p>Ten years ago, I started to notice Doreen was having problems with numbers. She couldn't sort out the change. It was two years before we got a diagnosis, that she had Alzheimer's. She has never really understood what is happening to her. The change in her was slow and almost imperceptible. But I wept for her. It was so dreadful that such a lovely person should face such a thing.</p>
      <p>All along I'd assumed we'd stay at home. But after six years, she developed problems I just couldn't cope with. She moved into a home, and for two months I visited her every day. It was obvious from day one that I should live there, too. I wanted to continue being important in her life. Selling our house was like losing another partner. You mourn for these things, as if they were human; the conservatory full of plants we'd tended together, all her paintings.</p>
      <p>Doreen lives on a secure wing, and I have a separate room. She doesn't communicate at all now. She sits around looking lovely. I envy her tranquillity. I go up every day. She doesn't know it's me - Pat, her husband - but I think she thinks I'm a friendly face. That's good enough for me. I just cherish what's left.</p>
      <p>Now I must fill my days. I walk, garden, do my stamp albums. I don't want to sit slumped on a chair, like everyone else here. And Doreen, she'll just fade away. She won't be afraid of it. But I'll be shattered. Inertia will probably keep me here after she's gone. I am 86, and it's just too daunting to find a new house. But you live day by day. It's hard to live any other way.</p>
      <p>Together for 73 years</p>
      <p>Gladys, 100, and Fred Croft, 96, met at a dance in New Malden,</p>
      <p>south-west London, in 1931. Gladys was a factory worker; Fred an engineer who then joined the air force. They married in 1940, before Fred was posted abroad. After the war, Fred worked for the NHS, and the couple settled in the London suburbs. They have a daughter, Audrey, 69, and a grandson, Iain, 41. They live in couples' accommodation in the Acacia Mews care home in St Albans.</p>
      <p>Gladys: My mother died of an asthma attack when I was 18, and my father remarried and went off with his new family. He paid our rent, but we never saw him again. My youngest sister was only eight, so we had to bring ourselves up - five sisters in a small flat in Raynes Park.</p>
      <p>I would go out with the girls I worked with at the weekend. We'd always have a good laugh. That's where I saw Fred for the first time, at a dance. I loved dancing back then.</p>
      <p>We got married just before he left for the war and I wore a wedding dress that three of my sisters had already worn. We didn't have many guests, just my sisters and Fred's mum, who had made a fruitcake.</p>
      <p>I didn't want children during the war, because so many fathers didn't come back, you see. You can't think the worst, but my sister's husband was killed in the war - terribly sad.</p>
      <p>Audrey was born in May 1946. It was too late to have any more children, because I was so old - 32. We decided that we wouldn't have any more.</p>
      <p>We've had some wonderful holidays. Fred would often surprise me by booking a hotel for the weekend. We both love seeing places - Denmark, Spain, Ireland - but we'd never take a package tour. We liked to do it ourselves, see a lot of things.</p>
      <p>We don't get flustered; I think that's the secret. Fred is very easy-going. He'll go into the garden and I'll leave him be. He has been a good husband, and I think I've been a good wife.</p>
      <p>We haven't had difficult times or problems like many other people have - we've had good health, nice holidays, and we've worked hard. We've done everything together, and always had each other. We've never been lonely. I have never been unhappy in all my life. You have to make your own pleasures, don't you?</p>
      <p>Fred: There's nothing magical about it, really. We've just lived a normal life. If you've got problems, you sort them out. We have arguments, but we've never had a row. Not a proper one.</p>
      <p>Yes, there are things we would have liked to have, but if we couldn't afford it, we didn't buy it. We never bought a house. Borrowing money makes for trouble. I've met two people in my life with plenty of money and they've never been happy. Money causes terrible worries for people.</p>
      <p>The things you saw in the war, they shaped you. These days, youngsters don't seem satisfied with life. They think nothing of getting married three times. Our grandson, Iain, is divorced. I think you've got to try to be happy with what you have. Don't always be looking elsewhere. Don't aim for the moon.</p>
      <p>I've always let Gladys do what she pleased. If she wanted to go out with the girls, she just went. I didn't worry. But I've always included her in my interests, that's the thing. I love boats, and we had wonderful barge holidays together for 30 years.</p>
      <p>It'll come some day, life without each other. We don't like to think about it. Gladys gets panic attacks. I can't stand up on my own any more, so I can't help her. It's terrible to watch. I wouldn't want to be without her *</p>

      <title>Cricket: The Ashes: Now the gloves come off: Forget the preliminaries. The Ashes begin tonight on a ground where Australia have not lost in 22 years: Now the gloves come off at last</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>This Ashes tour has been like no other in living memory. While England have gone on their serene way in Test match preparation, with scarcely a hiccup, the Australians have been floundering with issues of form, fitness, and confidence, each as yet not fully resolved.</p>
      <p>Cricket Australia, the governing body, seems to be in turmoil, with a marketing department that appears to be ruling the roost. The chairman of selectors made his initial squad announcement from beneath the railway arches by Circular Quay in Sydney, and latterly, when the squad was reduced, could be interviewed by the luggage carousel at Adelaide airport. Few players have managed any performances of substance in the state cricket they have played, and two days ago their reserve wicketkeeper Tim Paine, himself pushing strongly for a Test spot, broke a finger playing in a hit-and-giggle promotional Twenty20 match at The Gabba, and is out for the duration of the series. It has been calamitous.</p>
      <p>Even the phoney war, that period when local comment bounces between the barbed and the patronising, has been powder-puff stuff, done for the sake of it rather than with any malice. So Mitchell Johnson is going to "target" Andrew Strauss (he is an opening bowler: who else is he going to target? Kylie Minogue?), Matthew Hayden says that England have been "hiding" and have had "a sleepy start so far", which shows what can happen if you club yourself over the head with your own Mongoose, while one newspaper's risible go at baiting England - headlined "10 reasons why the Poms are duds" - would have been fine if you could not have substituted Australia for each and every one. It just hasn't been the same. If not actually an air of resignation, there is apprehension in the wind. Even the majority of local pundits appear to be tipping England to win the series.</p>
      <p>But everyone knows that when the teams arrive at The Gabba tomorrow, none of this, not England's controlled build-up or Australia's flapping, will count for a hill of beans. In Australia, there is no such thing as an uncompetitive Australian cricket team. At The Gabba, that charmless, characterless concrete bowl, with its dressing-room bunkers, they have been nigh on invincible. And they know that since Len Hutton's 1954-55 England side lost by an innings but won three Tests thereafter, no visiting side has come unstuck at The Gabba and recovered to win the series. They play here at this time of year for climatic reasons rather than to exert early authority, but the fact remains that this is their fortress.</p>
      <p>In order then to win the series, or even draw it, England need to overturn history for unless the weather interferes in its tropical intensity, The Gabba does not do draws. Andy Flower is a keen student of statistical analysis so will be aware of the most fundamental of these: that Australia have lost only three of the past 26 matches played between the sides in Australia since Mike Gatting's 1986-87 triumph and each of those after the destiny of the Ashes had been decided; that indeed Australia have won 10 of the past 11 Ashes matches in this country; and that no visiting team has won a Test match in Brisbane since Viv Richards's great West Indians 22 years ago.</p>
      <p>All this of course is part of the intimidatory factor of an Ashes series. It extends further: to the notion that the series will be decided on the first day, or the first hour, first over or even first ball and that beyond that, should they not come out on top, there can be no comeback. This is to underestimate the resilience of the England team under Flower and Strauss who between them coaxed an Ashes win at home (winning at Lord's on the way, the first time Australia had lost there since 1934 and following Cardiff where they were heavily outplayed but survived), and a drawn series in South Africa against the odds. Somehow captain and coach raised the team performance to such an extent last year that they overcame the debacle at Headingley to win at The Oval. So an Australian win at The Gabba would not, and should not, be regarded as the end of the matter, any more than would an England win (although the clamour for change in Australia would be considerable in the event).</p>
      <p>Crucial to the game is the pitch. A recent Shield match and a one-day international appeared to indicate the possibility of a capricious surface. But those games were following unseasonably heavy rain which hampered pitch preparation. In the past few weeks the heavy rain has been replaced by afternoon showers only, which enables proper preparation.</p>
      <p>This promises to be a typical Gabba Test surface, with good pace and carry, some help for the seamers early on, but settling down thereafter. Later, as Shane Warne's record here would suggest, it can help spin. The toss, of course, will be a big factor, although there appears to be one rule for Australians and another for the opposition. Not since 1985, when New Zealand were here, has a visiting side put Australia in and won. Since then, of 11 winning tosses, the visitors have fielded first on nine occasions without further success (although they may well not have won even had they batted first: fielding, as Nasser Hussain clearly thought, would give them their best chance).</p>
      <p>Against this, Australia have won 13 tosses and batted first on seven of them. Since his blunder at Edgbaston in 2005, Ricky Ponting has always batted when winning the toss, whatever the circumstance: at Headingley this year, against Pakistan he did so and the side were bowled out for 88. It is fundamental to England's strategy that they create scoreboard pressure with first-innings runs, so it would be astounding, given the reasonable weather forecast, if given the opportunity, they did anything other than bat first.</p>
      <p>The biggest stumbling block that England may come across is the Australia captain himself, a driven man and supreme batsman, but one on the brink of becoming only the third captain of his country to lose three Ashes series. Of late, Ponting has had a lean time with the bat, but he excels at The Gabba averaging more than 66, with four hundreds (two against England) against a career average of almost 55. He is, they say, fitter than he has ever been, lean and hungry and on the verge of 12,000 Test runs. There is a massive burden on him, however, and it will be a huge test for him should he not get support from the rest of the Australian batting. Conversely how will they cope in the unlikely event that Ponting has a bad series?</p>
      <p>England's bowling is key. All four bowlers, with Test experience in Australia limited to Jimmy Anderson alone, will take on a heavy workload. They will be well drilled in the lengths and lines to bowl (which fundamentally means a fullish length to encourage taking the edge, with a preparedness to be driven down the ground) and now have only to carry out their plans.</p>
      <p>The performance of Anderson, one of the most improved bowlers in world cricket, will set the standard. If he swings the new ball he can be devastating. But Graeme Swann will have a crucial role, too. Doug Bollinger's lack of match fitness means that Australia will field only the single left-arm paceman to create rough for him to exploit outside the right-hander's off-stump. However the fact that Australia recognise his threat and will attempt to get after him, may play into his hands for he is too canny to be belted out of the attack.</p>
      <p>The possible absence of Michael Clarke, the most adept Australian against spin, will just make it more difficult. On a seamers' pitch Swann can still play a part. He will benefit too from the extra bounce and the use, for the first time in an Ashes series here, of the Umpire Decision Review System. So too will the batsmen. Last time, England felt strongly that they were on the receiving end of too many bad decisions. There will be fewer excuses this time.</p>
      <p>Captions:</p>
      <p>If England's main striker bowler, James Anderson, can swing the ball in Australian conditions he will be devastating</p>

      <title>Review: THE LOUDEST THING WE'D EVER HEARD: One night in 1964, 16-year-old Richard Williams 's school music society was charged with keeping screaming fans away from a cool new group: the Rolling Stones. On the eve of the reissue of 22 early Stones albums, he recalls his night with Mick, Keith, Brian, Charlie and Bill</title>

    <text>
      <p>Nowadays they wear earpieces and black satin jackets and look as though they could be packing heat. In my day - and there was only one of them - we wore medium-grey suits and school ties, and carried just enough money for the bus fare home. Funny to think that, almost 40 years ago, we were responsible for protecting the Rolling Stones from fan and foe.</p>
      <p>As members of the school music society, we were allowed to act as ushers at all the local concert halls. Normally we would turn up in our school uniforms and politely show people to their seats for an evening of Purcell or Hindemith. But when Monday, March 2 1964 came around, we found ourselves entitled to participate in a very different kind of experience.</p>
      <p>This was not the Rolling Stones' first visit to Nottingham. Five months earlier, soon after the release of their first single, they had played two shows at the Odeon cinema, below the Everly Brothers, Bo Diddley and Little Richard (who had been added by the promoter after the tour's early dates had failed to attract enough interest). Although the single had not been a hit, the buzz was already about. For some forgotten reason, almost certainly to do with a lack of cash, I missed them at the Odeon, which made the chance to see them for nothing at the Albert Hall - a miniature version of the better-known one in Kensington Gore - even more attractive.</p>
      <p>The music society probably had no more than 20 or 30 members, who met for occasional record recitals and debates: Viennese dodecaphony versus English pastoralism, that kind of thing. In the days after the Stones' concert was announced, the secretary was deluged with applications, most of them from boys who would have had trouble distinguishing a C major scale from a hole in the ground. They were out of luck. Only existing members, it was said, would be allowed to act as ushers for the Rolling Stones.</p>
      <p>So it was that, after a day spent studying Chaucer and the principles of local government, a couple of friends and I were to be found shuffling our feet nervously in the backstage dressing room (the very one we had used a fortnight earlier for the school's spring concert) as Mick Jagger, Brian Jones, Keith Richards, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts draped themselves over the furniture and acted nonchalant.</p>
      <p>We were 16; with the exception of Wyman, who was already 27 but not admitting it, the Stones were all 21 or 22. In their elephant-cord hipsters, tab-collared shirts and Carnaby Street suede laceups, they exuded an ineffable and hopelessly unattainable cool. At that stage, the burden of debauchery sat lightly upon them. When invited, they signed their names on a paper napkin without demur. They showed no surprise at the presence in their dressing room of a group of boys in school uniform, although even at that stage they would probably have chosen to die rather than show surprise at anything at all.</p>
      <p>Half an hour later I was stationed in the middle of the first of several rows of seats immediately behind Charlie Watts's drum-kit. Being a drummer myself, I could hardly have been granted a finer vantage point. Not, as it turned out, that I would get very much time to study the subtleties of Charlie's hi-hat technique.</p>
      <p>The hall was packed, which meant that there were about 900 people present, probably none over 20, and evenly divided between the genders. At the cutting edge of teenage tastes, rhythm and blues had taken over from the Mersey beat. Chuck Berry's Memphis Tennessee had recently made the top 10. The Stones themselves could be heard playing their cover versions of obscure R&amp;B songs on Saturday Club, the BBC's radio pop show. Their unspectacular first single had been a brittle, twitchy cover of Berry's Come On. That was what the boys were interested in.</p>
      <p>But with I Wanna Be Your Man, a much poppier song given to them by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the Stones had reached No 13 in the charts a few weeks earlier. Much to their surprise, this bunch of hardcore blues enthusiasts started to find themselves being mobbed by pubescent girls. They had been seen on Thank Your Lucky Stars and Ready Steady Go, where it was noted that their hair was longer and shaggier than the Beatles'. Even more important, they did nothing to ingratiate themselves. Lips were curled and smiles were sardonic. Where winsome Paul McCartney grinned, shook his head and went "Wooooo!", Mick Jagger did a sinuous little Nureyev-goes-to-Harlem dance and shook his quadruple maraccas like voodoo implements, a portrait of self-absorption. When he sang Muddy Waters' I Just Want to Make Love to You, the word "love" was elongated and lubricated in a way that made it mean something quite different from the "love" in Cliff Richard's songs. The girls were there because the Stones were sexy in a new and disturbingly exotic kind of way.</p>
      <p>So there I sat in the front row of the choir seats, with a few feet of stage between me and Charlie's Gretsch drums, flanked by girls who were already flushed with anticipatory arousal, conscious of my duty and wondering what came next.</p>
      <p>As soon as the Stones emerged from the stairwell that led from the dressing room up to the stage, that question was answered. When they walked into the light there were screams, and tears, and within moments the first attempt was made to get close to a Stone. Doing something about that, it turned out, was supposed to be my responsibility.</p>
      <p>Luckily these were the early days of 60s pop hysteria. Certain rules of decorum still applied. A minimal degree of physical restraint - even when applied by a 16-year-old in a school tie - seemed to work. The attempt to make contact, it seemed, was more important than the success. But those attempts continued throughout the set, which meant that I have little memory of what the Stones played that night, or how they played it. What I do remember is that they performed their new single, a version of the Crickets' Not Fade Away set to a storming Bo Diddley beat, and that they were the loudest thing I'd ever heard - even though each guitarist had only one small amplifier on stage, while the vocal amplification was consigned to a pair of primitive column PA speakers.</p>
      <p>What must have been an hour, or getting on for it, passed like five minutes. It was new and strange and totally exhilarating, whether you were invading the stage or defending it.</p>
      <p>I left the hall carrying the unexpected prize of Charlie's drumsticks, which he handed to me as he left the stage. Halfway along the shaft of each one was a huge jagged notch, as if the stick had been gnawed by a large rodent. Etched by the repeated impact of the wood against the steel rim of his snare drum, this was tangible evidence of the force with which he drove the band's backbeat. Late that evening at the Don Juan coffee bar I gave one of the sticks and the autographed napkin - the signatures of all five original Rolling Stones on one piece of paper! - to a dark-haired girl who liked poetry and R&amp;B and, I hoped, would look on me with favour as a result. She took the drumstick and the autographs but gave nothing at all in return.</p>
      <p>You can see what the night was like by watching the video of 25x5, the documentary made by the late Nigel Finch to celebrate the Stones' first quarter-century, which includes footage shot at the Albert Hall - the real one this time - during a concert two years later. In London the bouncers were not schoolboys but middle-aged men with dark suits and uncompromising expressions. They show no compunction in grabbing a pretty blonde in a Biba striped minidress - she could be the third Shrimpton, a sister to Jean and Chrissie - and hurling her back into the stalls. As a shocked Keith Richards tries to hang on to his Gibson guitar while escaping the stage, Brian Jones laughs hysterically in his face at the madness of it all.</p>
      <p>By then they had laid aside their repertoire of songs borrowed from the R&amp;B masters. Under the influence of Andrew Oldham, a Tin Pan Alley apprentice who was only 19 when he followed up a tip and went to see them at the Crawdaddy club in Richmond, they had begun writing their own songs. Oldham saw from the example of the Beatles that original material would be needed if his group were to outlast most of those thrown up by the beat boom. And he had spent enough time hanging around the offices of music publishers to know that copyrights were where the real money could be made.</p>
      <p>The emergence of Jagger and Richards as songwriters is one of the main themes of the 22 Rolling Stones albums reissued in digitally remastered form this month. They run from the US version of their first album, released in 1964, to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out, the 1969 live album. En route from Come On to Gimme Shelter, from the Crawdaddy to Altamont, from obscurity to global notoriety, these CDs tell most of the story.</p>
      <p>"They were bad boys when I met them," Oldham told a journalist recently. "I just brought out the worst in them." But were they really so bad, so unwilling to compromise with the establishment? For all their insolent posturing, as early as their first single they were prepared to avoid controversy by changing Chuck Berry's "some stupid jerk" to "some stupid guy". In 1965 they shot a US TV promotional clip for Satisfaction in which the line "And I'm trying to make some girl" was fudged. In 1967, promoting Let's Spend the Night Together on the Ed Sullivan Show, they amended the title line, which came out as "Let's spend some time together". A year later they complied with Decca's horrified rejection of the original artwork for Beggars Banquet, which depicted a graffiti-covered lavatory wall. And as late as 1975 they accepted the need to censor Starfucker, which re-emerged as Star Star.</p>
      <p>But Oldham told the world they were bad boys, and the world was anxious to believe him. If the Beatles' importance was 75% musical and 25% cultural, with the Stones the proportions were reversed. The Stones connected with an audience that was emerging from the age of deference and was showing the beginnings of an interest in sociopathic and transgressive behaviour. Their appeal had less to do with the music than with their listeners' idea of themselves. The Stones were the oil on the hinge of the doorway that led to the garden of earthly delights, and the music was just an excuse.</p>
      <p>Yet when Jagger and Richards sat down early in 1965 and turned an old Staple Singers gospel song into The Last Time, they were creating the first great riff-driven rock song. They followed it with Satisfaction, Get Off of My Cloud, 19th Nervous Breakdown and Paint It Black, all within barely a year - their golden age. As Shawn Levy describes in Ready Steady Go, his study of the forces that created Swinging London, they made a fruitful connection with the jeunesse d'oree of the time, the young acid-head aristos and heiresses of the King's Road, whose foppish decadence filtered into songs such as Play With Fire and Lady Jane. From It's All Over Now to Brown Sugar, they made great party records. Over the long haul, however, they were hugely inconsistent. Moments of brilliance could not disguise the fact that, during an era of phenomenally rapid evolution, they were always a couple of paces behind the Beatles.</p>
      <p>It took a while for Jagger and Richards to find a way to speak directly to their audience. Lennon and McCartney had always done it: Love Me Do, Please Please Me and I Want to Hold Your Hand were aimed straight at the shopgirls and secretaries in the front row at their gigs. But the Stones, having borrowed their early repertoire, started off as if they were addressing the women who populated the cotton fields and juke joints of the Delta. It was not until Oldham forced them into songwriting that they found their voice and - in Stupid Girl, Under My Thumb and The Spider and the Fly - their targets.</p>
      <p>Over the years there has been no shortage of reasons to be sceptical of the Rolling Stones. A random selection might include their involvement in Godard's dreadful One Plus One, the girl's blouse Jagger wore in Hyde Park, the pathetic flirtations with evil, the phrase "child-bearing lips", Jagger's acceptance of a knighthood, and the mere existence of It's Only Rock'n'Roll, rivalled only by We Are the Champions as the most banal and unnecessary song produced in the name of "rock". The death of Brian Jones left them without a musically inquisitive intelligence, although the arrival of the gregarious Ron Wood in 1974 supplied the social glue that held them together in the 1980s, when the relationship between Jagger and Richards was at its most fissile. Hardly a single one of their albums is solid all the way through, and some have barely a redeeming feature.</p>
      <p>There is also - and here the 22 reissued CDs provide a powerful reminder - a pervasive sense of shoddiness clinging to their early output. Mostly this is the legacy of Oldham's decision, soon after taking them on, to sign the band to Decca Records, reasoning that the label that had missed the Beatles would want to compensate by trying harder to promote their potential rivals. Nor was the situation helped when, in 1966, he passed their management over to Allen Klein, a New York music industry veteran who successfully renegotiated their various deals on much better terms but was slow to cough up the proceeds. In 1969 - the year of drugs busts, Marianne Faithfull's suicide attempt, Brian's death, and Altamont, the ultimate bad trip - the Stones finally rid themselves of Klein. "He did very good deals for us," Bill Wyman said, "but I think he was really looking after himself."</p>
      <p>Klein's compensation (part of "the price of an education", in Keith Richards' phrase) was the continued ownership by his company, ABKCO, of the Stones' Decca recordings. And now his son, Jody H Klein, is named as the supervisor of the long-awaited Rolling Stones Remastered project, in which the original tapes have been remastered with the aim of recreating the sound that the musicians heard in the studio.</p>
      <p>According to the publicity, the digipak sleeves stay as close as possible to the original LP artwork. But British fans who were there at the beginning will be disappointed by the absence of the original UK versions of the first two albums, with their revolutionary plain covers - just a moody colour photograph without any indication of the group's name, making the purchaser feel like a member of a secret society.</p>
      <p>Little imagination is shown in the reorganisation of this material, and important opportunities have been missed. Rather than create new and thematically coherent compilations of greatest hits and rarities, ABKCO has merely reissued the five familiar anthologies, with all their duplications. The effort involved in providing each CD with an absurd "certificate of authenticity" would have been better spent on providing full discographical details. Instead, mistakes are either perpetuated or created. In the songwriting credits we are introduced to "Arthur Alexandra" and "M Margonfield", while Mick Jagger and Brian Jones are both said to contribute "harmonics" to the band.</p>
      <p>A few weeks after I first saw them in Nottingham, they arrived in California to begin their first American tour, which included 12 shows in 18 days. Tomorrow night they play Ford Field in Detroit, six weeks into a five-month tour arranged to celebrate their 40th anniversary. Last week, talking about his relationship with Jagger, which began when they were both four years old, Richards told the New York Times: "You can get rid of the old lady, but I can't get rid of Mick and he can't get rid of me." Their longevity is a marvel, but no inducement could persuade me to go and see them in a sports stadium, where they have never been anything more than a rock'n'roll circus act.</p>
      <p>In a more helpful environment, something very different emerges. Watching them rehearse for the Exile on Main Street tour in a small cinema on the shore of Lake Geneva 30 years ago, it was easy to see what Oldham glimpsed in the back room of Richmond's Station Hotel on the night he decided he could make them stars: a perfectly tuned mechanism too often obscured by the scale of tours aimed at sustaining expensive lifestyles.</p>
      <p>You can still hear it on the earliest of the old recordings, in the wonderfully relaxed drive of Down the Road a Piece, a rackety roadhouse blues, or in Bo Diddley's Mona, a concerto for reverb-drenched rhythm guitar. At such moments the layers of powder and paint accumulated over decades dissolve to reveal once again the lithe outline of a sometimes great band.</p>
      <p>On that night in 1964, I was too busy detaching girls from Charlie Watts's shoulders and putting them back into their seats to notice the details. Now I wish I could say for sure whether Brian was playing his teardrop-shaped Vox Phantom guitar, or if Keith accompanied the final chord of each song with the decorous little bow that can be seen on all surviving footage from their early gigs. But one thing I do remember. No matter how many girls were trying to drag him off his stool, Charlie never dropped a beat.</p>
      <p>The 22 Rolling Stones Remastered albums are released by ABKCO on October 21.</p>

      <title>G2: Death in Mexico: Swine flu may have attracted the headlines, but the real killer in Mexico is the savage drugs war that has claimed an appalling 7,600 lives in the last 18 months. Rory Carroll reports from the frontline city of Juarez</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A voice from head-quarters crackles over the army radio. "Shots fired on Avenida de los Insurgentes. Gunmen operating from two, maybe three vehicles. Target unknown." It is 9.20am, a remorseless sun is already blistering the city, and the soldiers have their first</p>
      <p>mission of the day. Engines roar into life and the convoy of green army trucks and blue-</p>
      <p>and-white police cars swerves through traffic in a blur of sirens.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, the target is still alive. Suit saturated in blood, skin flour-white, eyes wild, but alive. He is slumped at a shopfront, red palm-prints smeared on the glass door; behind him a trail of dark stains, a black shoe and broken glass from a framed painting that he dropped. The gunmen are gone. The victim, a 51-year-old businessman, took two bullets escaping a kidnap attempt. Given the grotesque ways that captivity tends to end in Ciudad Juarez, he is lucky.</p>
      <p>An ambulance ferries the stretchered figure to hospital while a familiar tableau arranges itself. Soldiers seal off the scene with yellow tape. Photographers and TV crews stake out positions. A police helicopter clatters overhead. The owners of the bloodied property - a graphic design company called Pop Estudio - attack the stains with brooms and an orange tub of Mr Musculo Multi-Accion. In Juarez, everyone knows to clean quickly, before the blood stinks in the desert heat.</p>
      <p>I have witnessed just one skirmish in a multi-pronged, brutal drugs war that is convulsing Mexico. Forget the swine flu epidemic, this</p>
      <p>war has proved many times more deadly. Since 2007, approximately 7,600 people have</p>
      <p>been killed - more than double the number killed over three decades in Northern Ireland's Troubles. Some Mexican cities have surpassed Iraq's levels of mayhem. Drug cartels are butchering weaker rivals in a Darwinian</p>
      <p>contest for la plaza - trafficking routes that bring unimaginable wealth to those who</p>
      <p>control them.</p>
      <p>The savagery is numbing. Mutilated bodies turn up daily - some suspended from bridges, others dumped in schools or on roadsides. Human remains are found in barrels of acid. Severed heads are rolled on to nightclub dancefloors, or left at monuments with notes stuck in their mouths. Police chiefs are ambushed in broad daylight, after which the killers play narcocorridos (ballads glorifying their deeds) on police frequencies. Somewhere in the middle of all this are 111 million ordinary Mexicans, aghast at the horror.</p>
      <p>In Juarez, graffiti spraypainted on a wall reads: "My city asks for clemency amid your madness." Another says: "Assassin do not kill me, I want to keep growing - the children."</p>
      <p>The United States is worried, too. Barry McCaffrey, a former drug tsar and retired general, has raised the prospect of "millions</p>
      <p>of refugees" if the mayhem continues. The</p>
      <p>US Joint Forces Command warns of the danger to US security. Analysts have debated at what point Mexico may fit the definition of a failed state. On a visit to Mexico City in April,</p>
      <p>President Barack Obama warned that border violence spillover was "sowing chaos in our communities". All of which begs the question: is Mexico doomed?</p>
      <p>The answer resides in Juarez. This hardscrabble sprawl of slums, sweatshop factories, strip malls, motels and gas stations, all</p>
      <p>bleached and peeled by desert wind, is the war's crucible. Walk to the end of Avenida Juarez and you see why: across a dry riverbed - the Rio Grande - sits El Paso, Texas. More than a frontier between the developed and the developing worlds, it is a gateway to the American drug consumer. It takes 10 minutes to cross the Paso del Norte international bridge and you pay three pesos (20 US cents) at the turnstile. Smugglers tend to prefer sandier, clandestine crossings.</p>
      <p>More than 1,600 people were killed in</p>
      <p>Juarez last year, a ferocious number for a city of just 1.3m. Knock off two zeroes and you get</p>
      <p>El Paso's murder total: 16. Little wonder billboards on the southern side of the border are obsessed by salvation. "God is the solution," declares one. "Give peace a chance," says another, beside a picture of John Lennon. Avenida Gomez Morin has the most plaintive: "Pray for Ciudad Juarez. We need it."</p>
      <p>A hundred yards up the highway, a grieving family were doing precisely that at the Eternal Flame funeral home when gunmen stormed</p>
      <p>in to re-shoot the corpse in his coffin. The</p>
      <p>owner of a bar called Amores, he had been</p>
      <p>killed days earlier by a narco gang that evidently felt more punishment was needed. For</p>
      <p>good measure, in the second attack they</p>
      <p>also shot his brother, the owner of another</p>
      <p>bar. "It was a difficult time," says Ricardo,</p>
      <p>the funeral home manager, with magisterial understatement.</p>
      <p>There is a logic to the bloodshed, which goes something like this. Colombia, the source of most US-bound cocaine, used to be the main narco battlefield until the 90s, when Mexican gangs seized control of the transit routes north. Juarez was the domain of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the legendary "Lord of the Skies". Since his death in 1997, the cartel has been headed by his brother Vicente.</p>
      <p>Two rivals, the Sinaloa cartel from the Pacific coast and the Gulf cartel from the other side of Mexico, invaded to wrest control of la plaza from the homegrown Juarez cartel. In addition to their own death squads, they sub-contracted killings to local gangs with names such as the Aztecas (affiliated to Juarez) and the Mexicles (Sinaloa). Now the Gulf cartel has withdrawn and a faction from Juarez has defected to Sinaloa, giving the edge to its leader, Joaquin "Short and Stocky" Guzman, Mexico's most wanted man.</p>
      <p>In theory, killings and kidnappings are tactical operations to defeat the other side and extort money from those caught in the middle. In practice, anarchy reigns. Police in the border city of Tijuana recently announced that drug traffickers had smothered three women, aged 23 to 25, and dissolved their bodies in a caustic substance because of an argument in a bar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Juarez, the plague of disappearances of young women that made the city infamous in the 1990s continues unchecked. Whoever abducts them - theories include human traffickers, rogue police and narco gangs - exploits the insecurity and impunity wrought by the drug war. A wooden cross memorial with more than 300 nails - each representing a desaparecida from the last decade - is inscribed "Not one more". Yet shopfronts and lampposts are haunted with posters appealing for information about recent victims. Typically in mid-to-late teens, the girls gaze from grainy photographs, some grinning, some solemn. "The police did nothing. The army did nothing. They're like toy soldiers," says Maria Hernandez, 70, the grandmother of Lidia, a medical student who vanished last December. Asked what age Lidia was, the elderly woman, eyes moist, amends the tense. "Is," she says quietly. "What age she is . Seventeen."</p>
      <p>But if Juarez embodies Mexico's crisis, it also, according to the government, embodies its solution. The city is the showcase for a radical policy to deploy the army. With police too frightened - and corrupt - to respond to all the violence, some 2,000 soldiers arrived in March 2008. It was, at first, a fiasco. The narcos escalated attacks on each other, the security forces and anybody else who stood in their</p>
      <p>way. Staff at the local paper, El Diario, tracked murder tolls with a blue marker on a news-room "board of death". Traffickers tried to intimidate the media by leaving a severed head at a journalists' monument. Shortly afterwards, El Diario's investigative reporter, Armando Rodriguez, was shot dead. "It just got worse and worse. It reached a level we had never seen before," says Rocio Gallegos, a news editor on the paper.</p>
      <p>In March this year, President Felipe Calderon went for broke: 10,000 soldiers and federal police officers saturated Juarez, part of a 45,000-strong taskforce. A fresh rotation entered the city earlier this month: a mile-long convoy of Humvees, trucks and hardware. And the army's presence has smothered violence</p>
      <p>in the city: murders fell from 234 in February to 77 in March and 85 in April. Crime has plunged 80%. The police, a disgraced and humiliated force which had been largely coopted by the narcos, are being rebuilt. Hundreds of officers have been purged and new cadets are being trained by military police.</p>
      <p>"There is no quick fix, but I am sure we can succeed in the long term. The army cannot be infiltrated by narco-traffickers," says Julian Rivera Breton, an army general who is the</p>
      <p>new police chief. It is a hellish job. Narcos</p>
      <p>forced out Breton's predecessor by killing</p>
      <p>an officer every 48 hours until he quit. Police stations are fortresses with sentries, sandbags, machine-gun nests and black ribbons for</p>
      <p>fallen comrades. My dictaphone is banned</p>
      <p>for "security reasons" from the general's vicinity, but Breton is upbeat. "This level of</p>
      <p>co-ordination between the army, police and different levels of government is unprecedented. We have public confidence. This has started well and it must end well."</p>
      <p>The Obama administration, which has heaped praise on President Calderon's courage, said it will do its bit by stemming the "iron river" of guns flowing south across the</p>
      <p>border. An even larger favour to Mexico would be stemming US demand for cocaine and methamphetamines, an insatiable market that drives the economics, and atrocities, of narco-trafficking. Law enforcement officials recognise that as long as there is demand - and profits - drugs will always find a way in. The hope, from Mexico's viewpoint, is to redirect the flow.</p>
      <p>"We're not going to stop drugs reaching the US, but we can make Mexico a difficult option and force traffickers to use other routes," says Jose Reyes Ferriz, the mayor of Juarez.</p>
      <p>Certainly, several drug lords have been</p>
      <p>captured in recent months and Mexico's government has indicated that the army will stay on the streets until 2013. "We are not on our knees; we are still walking," says Gallegos, the newspaper editor.</p>
      <p>Walking, or at least staggering, yes. But winning the war? Look behind the lower murder rates and official spin and the picture looks grim. Mexico is not defeating narco-traffickers. Stalemate seems the likeliest outcome. Janet Napolitano, the US secretary of homeland security, warned as much at a senate judiciary committee hearing earlier this</p>
      <p>month: "Yes, we have seen a reduction in violence, but how long can it be sustained?"</p>
      <p>A trade worth billions of dollars needs a corrupt nexus of business and politics. Saulo Reyes Gamboa, Juarez's former municipal police chief, was arrested in El Paso last year</p>
      <p>on suspicion of trying to smuggle a tonne of marijuana. He had interests in multiple companies and was a protege of the former mayor, Hector Murguia Lardizabal. Result: one year later, there are no investigations into the companies and Murguia, who denies any wrongdoing, has shrugged off the scandal</p>
      <p>and is tipped to be the next governor.</p>
      <p>The current mayor, Reyes Ferriz, is considered honest but, interviewed behind his</p>
      <p>huge desk, he flounders when asked why no politicians or business leaders have been charged. "Ah." Long pause. "Yes. That's, er, an interesting question. I don't have, um, that information. I think you should ask the</p>
      <p>attorney general's office."</p>
      <p>The bleak realisation that narcos are here to stay is etched in the crumbling neglect of</p>
      <p>slums such as Colonia Diaz Ordaz. A collection of hillside shacks hemmed in by parched mountains and the US border fence, it feels claustrophobic. Secondary schools barely function, leading to a 50% drop-out rate.</p>
      <p>The only legitimate jobs are in sweatshops</p>
      <p>that pay $40 a week. Welfare and healthcare</p>
      <p>are poor or absent. "The state doesn't function here," says Teresa Almada Mireles, who runs</p>

      <p>El Paso. "Except that here the quality is rubbish - it's mixed with other stuff so dealers make even more money," says Joe Nevarez, 54, a wiry, intense former addict who runs a shelter, Alcance Victoria, for junkies.

      <p>100 pesos ($7.50) from him.</p>
      <p>"Every night, the same. I can't stand it." Arrieta fidgets and rubs his eyes. "God forgive me, but they need to lock him up." He grabs</p>
      <p>my collar and twists it into a knot. "Lock him</p>
      <p>up so he can't get out, tight, like this." He loosens his grip and gulps some air. "My own son, God forgive me." The old man shuffles</p>

      <title>Get Out: the film that dares to reveal the horror of liberal racism in America</title>
      <subtitle>Jordan Peele's critically acclaimed low-budget shocker became a surprise hit and showed viewers a terrifying look at the fractured myth of a post-racial US</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The success of Jordan Peele's Get Out - it took $30m in its first weekend in the US - is remarkable for lots of reasons. This is a first-time film from a respected, but essentially cult comedian, with no real big-name stars and a premise which is anathema to most of middle America. Yet people came out to see it in their thousands and critics raved about a horror film, which just does not happen. The film has a A- rating from audiences on CinemaScore, which as some have pointed out is unheard of for a horror, and a rare 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Like Donald Glover's Atlanta, almost universal praise has followed the film's debut and as with that series, Peele has dealt with race in America in a refreshing, funny and unflinching manner. The number of things Peele manages to reference is stunning: the taboo of mixed relationships, eugenics, the slave trade, black men dying first in horror films, suburban racism, police brutality.</p>
      <p>Related: Get Out review - white liberal racism is terrifying bogeyman in sharp horror</p>
      <p>Film-makers have used absurd horror to tackle race before, like in Timo Vuorensola's 2012 film Iron Sky, which placed the action on the dark side of the moon where the Nazis had been hiding out, plotting to forcibly make black people white. But in Get Out, Peele brought the action much closer to home. Some have dubbed the film an " African-American nightmare movie "; it isn't. This is an American horror story. (It comes after an impressive run of low-budget two-word-title horrors that place the action in middle America, and prod at issues bubbling just beneath the surface: Don't Breathe, It Follows and You're Next.)</p>
      <p>The villains here aren't southern red necks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called "alt-right". They're middle class white liberals. The kind of people who read this website. The kind of people who shop at Trader Joe's, donate to the ACLU and would have voted for Obama a third time if they could. Good people. Nice people. Your parents, probably. The thing Get Out does so well - and the thing that will rankle with some viewers - is to show how, however unintentionally, these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people. It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester. It's an attitude, an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution, but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous.</p>
      <p>There was always something that didn't quite ring true about Guess Who's Coming to Dinner - a film many have compared to Get Out. It wasn't in Sidney Poitier's performance, which felt real: his anger, fear and frustration at having to battle his own family's disapproval of him marrying a white woman and her family's liberal hand wringing was note-perfect. What didn't feel real was the mostly calm reactions of almost everyone involved. In Get Out, under that placid exterior lurks the dark subconscious, where the true horror lies.</p>
      <p>Related: Trayvon Martin's parents, five years on: 'Racism is alive and well in America'</p>
      <p>In the screening I was at, the biggest reactions from the mainly black audience were the knowing laughs whenever Peele took on tropes people recognised from real life. There was the anxiety about meeting the family of a white partner, which proved to be well placed when Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) arrives at the Armitage residency and is immediately treated to a line of ham-fisted and loaded questioning. There was the cringe-inducing way the black serving staff are treated; the interactions with the police who, unlike in most horror films, aren't last-minute saviors but potential fatal hurdles.</p>
      <p>Horror tropes are inverted, subverted and turned on their head, none more so than the way Peele takes the idea of a white woman being in peril as soon as she's in an inner city area and turns that into a black man being at his vulnerable in an affluent white neighborhood. The unique history - plus the fascination, fetishization and fear of dark-skinned men - on this continent gives Get Out even more punch. After seeing it, I started to think that it might not be a coincidence the film came out almost five years to the day Trayvon Martin was killed.</p>
      <p>Peele said The Stepford Wives, because of the way it "dealt with social issues in regards to gender", was an inspiration for Get Out. "I just thought, that's proof that you can pull off a movie about race, that's a thriller and entertaining and fun," he said. His debut has managed to do just that, and like The Daily Show - a satirical news show which became must-watch social commentary - Peele has placed real issues in an unlikely context, this time a horror film, and said something painfully true about them. Get Out will be one of this year's biggest conversation starters. Just don't expect it to be comfortable.</p>

      <title>Review: NON-FICTION: A cargo of currants: Maya Jasanoff enjoys a valuable history of trading with the east: Pashas: Traders and Travellers in the Islamic World by James Mather 320pp, Yale, £25</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>To early English visitors, the grandeur of Constantinople's setting alone, on the border of Europe and Asia, made the city seem "built to command all the world". They marvelled at a skyline of cascading domes and pencil minarets, the fearsomely fortified city walls, and the majestic Topkapi Palace, home of the Ottoman sultan, one of the most powerful rulers on earth. Under the arches of the Grand Bazaar, spices, perfumes, coffee and silks made the city appear the "greatest emporium upon the face of the earth".</p>
      <p>Long before oil dominated western interest in the Middle East, these exotic goods lured English traders into the Ottoman empire. In 1581, a group of London-based "Turkey merchants" received a royal charter granting them a monopoly on Ottoman commerce. The Levant Company, as it was called, established "factories" at Constantinople, Smyrna and Aleppo, and developed a profitable import business based primarily on silk fabrics and, oddly enough, currants - the brown gold of their day. So central was commerce to Anglo-Ottoman relations that the Levant Company also managed England's diplomacy in the region, making it for almost a quarter millennium the primary conduit for English encounters with the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Astonishingly, no history has appeared of this influential organisation since 1935. James Mather has brilliantly stepped into the breach with Pashas, a vivacious vade mecum to the little-known operations of the Levant Company. Following the traders - or pashas - themselves, Mather whisks the reader into the souks and khans of the Ottoman empire, evoking at once a powerful sense of place and a real feel for the pleasures, pressures and profits that characterised the pashas' careers. Like many modern expats, they created self-contained little Englands in the Levant, hunting, playing cricket and drinking to excess. Yet, Mather stresses, they acquired more in the Middle East than sunburnt skins and personal wealth. Mixing among people of many faiths, writing copious observations for readers and correspondents back home, and bringing Arabic and Turkish texts back to England, the pashas helped shape British understanding of the Ottoman empire as an entity to be feared, respected and at times admired.</p>
      <p>Mather's description of this cosmopolitan milieu chimes with recent portrayals of contemporary British India by William Dalrymple, among others, covering a time when relations between Europe and the Muslim world had not yet hardened into a familiar Victorian mould. Mather draws a pointed contrast between the Levant Company and its better-known contemporary, the East India Company. Where the East India Company raised armies of sepoys, collected taxes, and administered whole provinces - becoming, in Edmund Burke's famous phrase, "a state in the disguise of a merchant" - the Levant Company pursued its trade at the sultan's pleasure, and never sought territorial control. The Levant Company's "commerce", Mather observes, "in no sense led to colonisation". The pashas could hardly imagine "that the Muslim map would one day be painted in shades of imperial pink". After all, the king's own ambassador, presenting his credentials at Topkapi, found himself seized by guards, pushed to his knees, and his forehead pressed to the floor beneath the sultan's feet - a forceful reminder of where authority rested.</p>
      <p>Mather makes a forceful case, and an appealingly well-written one at that. As with many attractive historical pictures, the rosy hues Mather illuminates sadly faded into black and white. By the time the East India Company governed parts of the Mughal empire, what held western Europeans back from encroaching into Ottoman domains was less an inability to do so than an unwillingness - compounded, for the British, with what seems in hindsight a stunning lack of interest. The French invasion of Egypt in 1798 changed all that, turning the Middle East into a prime arena of European imperial competition. Though the Levant Company itself may not have nurtured imperial ambitions, in 1825 it would be gobbled up by a British state that certainly did.</p>
      <p>This points to what is at once the greatest strength and weakness of Pashas. It offers much more Levant than Company. For all the rich human detail, the reader craves analysis of corporate structures and practices. How, for instance, did the company compare with the greatest commercial concerns of the period, oriented not toward Asia but toward the Atlantic? All those alluring Levantine imports were overshadowed in the British economy by the massive Atlantic traffic of fish, fur, tobacco, slaves - to say nothing of sugar, which ousted currants as the scourge of English teeth. And it was in North America, not Asia, that colonisation and commerce truly walked in step. It seems impossible fully to take the measure of Britain's eastern trade in this period without situating it alongside that of the Atlantic - as Captain John Smith, a founder of England's first successful North American colony, knew more intimately than most. Just a few years before settling Virginia, he had been a slave in the Ottoman empire.</p>
      <p>Mather frames his book as a response to the "clash of civilisations" arguments so prevalent in the wake of 9/11. As British troops are deployed in two predominantly Muslim countries, such a deeply felt plea for cross-cultural understanding continues to have its place. It is hard not to share Mather's hope that in "our post-imperial times" we may recover something of the cultural fluidity that characterised the pashas' age. But our world has never been post-imperial, and probably never will be. One can't help wondering, on putting down this elegant study, whether this is really the most important lesson to draw from Mather's book. Surely the greatest topical resonance held by the Levant Company's history does not lie with those distant Englishmen's capacity to appreciate an Islamic empire. It lies in the relationship of commercial to imperial power. Now, as western economies are declining in relation to rising Asian ones, Mather notes that Korean textiles and Chinese plastics fill the souks of Aleppo. We will not live to see how Asian historians two or three centuries hence may write about the decline of the west; instead we must hope their investigations will be as sensitive as this.</p>

      <subject>INTERVIEWS; PEACE PROCESS; PRIME MINISTERS; TERRORISM</subject>
      <title>Inside story: Why Barak is wrong: In an interview last week, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak laid the blame squarely on Yasser Arafat for the breakdown of the peace process. Here, Robert Malley and Hussein Agha counter his claims</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The Camp David summit ended almost two years ago yet the various interpretations of what happened there and its aftermath continue to draw exceptional attention both in Israel and in the US. Ehud Barak's interview with Benny Morris makes it clear why this is the case: Barak's assessment that the talks failed because Yasser Arafat cannot make peace with Israel and that his answer to Israel's unprecedented offer was to resort to terrorist violence has become central to the argument that Israel is in a fight for its survival against those who deny its very right to exist.</p>
      <p>Barak's central thesis is that the current Palestinian leadership wants "a Palestinian state in all of Palestine. What we see as self- evident, two states for two peoples, they reject". Arafat, he concludes, seeks Israel's "demise".</p>
      <p>On the question of the boundaries of the future state, the Palestinian position was for a Palestinian state based on the June 4, 1967 borders, living alongside Israel. At Camp David, Arafat's negotiators accepted the notion of Israeli annexation of West Bank territory to accommodate settlements, though they insisted on a one-for-one swap of land "of equal size and value." The Palestinians argued that the annexed territory should neither affect the contiguity of their own land nor lead to the incorporation of Palestinians into Israel.</p>
      <p>The ideas put forward by President Clinton at Camp David fell well short of those demands. In order to accommodate Israeli settlements, he proposed a deal by which Israel would annex 9% of the West Bank in exchange for turning over to the Palestinians parts of pre-1967 Israel equivalent to 1% of the West Bank. This proposal would have entailed the incorporation of tens of thousands of Palestinians into Israeli territory near the annexed settlements; and it would have meant that territory annexed by Israel would encroach deep inside the Palestinian state.</p>
      <p>The suggestion made by some that the Camp David summit broke down over the Palestinians' demand for a right of return simply is untrue: the issue was barely discussed between the two sides and President Clinton's ideas mentioned it only in passing.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians can be criticised for not having presented detailed plans at Camp David; but, as has been shown, it would be inaccurate to say they had no positions. It is also true that Barak broke a number of Israeli taboos and moved considerably from prior positions while the Palestinians believed they had made their historic concessions at Oslo, when they agreed to cede 78% of mandatory Palestine to Israel; they did not intend the negotiations to further whittle down what they already regarded as a compromise position.</p>
      <p>Barak claims that the Palestinian position was tantamount to a denial of Israel's right to exist and to seeking its destruction. The facts do not validate that claim. True, the Palestinians rejected the version of the two-state solution that was put to them. But it could also be said that Israel rejected the unprecedented two-state solution put to them by the Palestinians from Camp David onward, including the following provisions: a state of Israel incorporating some land captured in 1967 and including a very large majority of its settlers; the largest Jewish Jerusalem in the city's history; preservation of Israel's demographic balance between Jews and Arabs; security guaranteed by a US-led international presence.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister's remarks about other Arab leaders are misplaced. Arafat did not reach out to the people of Israel in the way President Sadat did. But unlike Sadat, he agreed to cede parts of the territory lost in 1967 - both in the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>Barak claims that "Israel is too strong at the moment to defeat, so (the Palestinians) formally recognise it. But their game plan is to establish a Palestinian state while always leaving an opening for further 'legitimate' demands down the road." Here Barak contradicts himself. For if that were the case, the logical course of action for Arafat would have been to accept Clinton's proposals at Camp David, and even more so on December 23. He would then have had over 90% of the land and much of East Jerusalem, while awaiting, as Barak would have it, the opportunity to violate the agreement and stake a claim for more.</p>
      <p>Barak focuses on the Palestinians' deficiencies, and dismisses as trivial sideshows major political decisions crucial to the understanding of that failure. When he took office he chose to renegotiate the agreement on withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank, signed by Benjamin Netanyahu, rather than implement it. He delayed talks on the Palestinian track while he concentrated on Syria.</p>
      <p>Barak's apparent insensitivity to the way his statements might affect the other side is revealed. He characterises Palestinian refugees as "salmon" whose yearning to return to their land is somehow supposed to fade away in 80 years in a manner that the Jewish people's never did, even after 2,000 years. When he denounces the idea that Israel should be a "state for all its citizens" he does not seem to realise that he risks alienating its many Arab citizens. Most troubling of all is his description of Arabs as people who "don't suffer from the problem of telling lies that exists in Judaeo-Christian culture. Truth is seen as an irrelevant category". It is hard to know what to make of this disparaging judgment of an entire people. In the history of this particular conflict, neither Palestinians nor Israelis have a monopoly on unkept commitments or promises.</p>
      <p>He rejects entirely the notion that Ariel Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif on September 28 2000, played any part in setting off the subsequent clashes. When we consider the context in which the visit was taking place - the intense focus on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif at Camp David and the general climate among Palestinians - its impact was predictable.</p>
      <p>Barak suggests that Arafat had planned as his response to the Camp David summit a campaign of violent terror. That is a curious assertion in view of the fact that the Palestinians had argued that the parties were not ready for a summit and that Camp David should be understood as merely the first of a series of meetings. In contrast, as he knows well, Barak conceived of Camp David as a make-or-break- summit. He made clear early on that he foresaw only two possible outcomes: a full-scale agreement on the "framework" of a settlement, or a full-scale confrontation.</p>
      <p>Barak's broad endorsement of Israel's current military campaign is cause for perhaps the greatest dismay. He appears to have given up on the current Palestinian leadership, placing his hopes in the next generation, but is there any reason to believe that today's children will grow up any less hardened and vengeful?</p>
      <p>The Camp David process was the victim of failings on the Palestinian side; but it was also, and importantly, the victim of failings on Israel's (and the United States') part. By refusing to recognise this, Barak continues to obscure the debate and elude fundamental questions about where the quest for peace ought to go now.</p>
      <p>Robert Malley was a member of the Clinton team at Camp David. Hussein Agha is a senior associate member of St Anthony's College, Oxford. This is an edited version of their response to Benny Morris's interview with Ehud Barak. Both articles are published in the current New York Review of Books.</p>

      <title>Political, forensic, hi-tech: how 'research architecture' is redefining art</title>
      <subtitle>In the 1990s, Goldsmiths college in London spawned the YBAs. Now, it has incubated a very different group - whose work is as likely to turn up in an international court as in a gallery</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Up a narrow staircase at the labyrinthine Goldsmiths college in London is an airy room where researchers, film-makers, AI experts, investigative journalists and archaeologists pore over computer screens. This is the nerve centre of Forensic Architecture, the research agency that was a strong contender for the 2018 Turner prize (they lost out to Charlotte Prodger ) and which has gained a name for its meticulous "counter-forensic" investigations into human rights abuses.</p>
      <p>In this post-truth era, verification is paramount, so myriad documentation sources have to be corroborated in minute detail. On a recent visit I paid them, researchers were synchronising police bodycam film and extended thermal footage with film shot by an activist. Someone else was scrutinising CCTV footage connected to the recent unsolved murder of an LGBTQ activist in Greece. The investigative film-maker Laura Poitras was visiting and journalists from the New York Times had been over to learn about setting up a visual investigations unit. A team is currently training Chicago activists to respond to police violence.</p>
      <p>Goldsmiths is once again the incubator of a new movement, 30 years after Damien Hirst and his fellow students swaggered into British art history with the landmark exhibition Freeze. But where the Young British Artists were about ego and in-your-face art, with its sharks and suggestive arrangements of kebabs and fried eggs, this is collaborative, research based and politically committed, spanning architecture, journalism, law and science. As with all the most interesting movements, there's controversy over whether it's even art.</p>
      <p>This movement has emerged and takes its name from the Centre for Research Architecture (CRA) at Goldsmiths. Research architecture has nothing to do with designing buildings but everything to do with the politics of space, especially how it is manipulated by states and corporations against civilians and the environment - from drone strikes in Pakistan to mining in the Amazon. Using sophisticated technologies such as remote sensing, 3D modelling and vessel-tracking, hard evidence of wrongdoing is gathered. The final work is as likely to be presented in an international court as in an art gallery. Evidence compiled by Forensic Architecture has been submitted to the International Criminal Court on Israel's 2014 assault on Gaza; to the Inter-American court on Guatemala's genocide; and to the European Court of Human Rights on Italy's role in migrant drowning deaths.</p>
      <p>"We are confrontational, interventional," says architect and activist Eyal Weizman, founder of Forensic Architecture, the most high-profile group to emerge from the CRA. As well as a research agency, Forensic Architecture has also evolved into an investigative, case-driven discipline within the broader field of research architecture. "There's this idea of really working as detectives," explains Lorenzo Pezzani, who has collaborated with the group and teaches a course in forensic architecture at the CRA.</p>
      <p>Serving as a petri dish for this new field, the CRA was set up as a postgraduate faculty at Goldsmiths by Weizman in 2005. Fourteen years of experimentation later, it is, according to Polly Staple of the Chisenhale Gallery, one of the most important creative bases in the UK. "It offers," she says, "a radically different position to that which is understood as 'art' and 'culture' by mainstream media and the art market."</p>
      <p>This is not art destined for collectors' homes. The CRA are confronting power structures responsible for violence, and uncovering hidden stories</p>
      <p>This is not an art destined for collectors' homes. It's not about beautiful paintings or even self-expression. Students and staff at the CRA are passionately confronting the power structures responsible for violence and destruction, employing multiple journalistic and technological tools to uncover hidden stories. They call themselves "spatial practitioners" rather than architects or artists, since exhibiting their films, images, installations and books in galleries is just one aspect of their work, which also includes teaching, collaborating with experts and ongoing research. Whether they're investigating claims of a so-called climate refugee community in Alaska threatened by the impact of global warming or Australia's violations against immigrants offshore, their aim is to effect political change.</p>
      <p>Recently, CRA graduate Lawrence Abu Hamdan staged a show that centred on the notion of "ear witness" testimony. In 2016, Abu Hamdan worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty to conduct interviews with former detainees of Syria's notorious Saydnaya prison, where inmates are mostly kept in darkness and sound is used as a weapon of torture, about what they heard. The result of this collaboration was presented last year to a German prosecutor in a petition against the Syrian government. For his show, Abu Hamdan displayed a selection of objects such as a popcorn maker, a car door and cannelloni pasta as a sound effects library, objects which could make the sound of a punch, kick or gunshot.</p>
      <p>Where Abu Hamdan explores audio, Alon Schwabe and Daniel Fernández Pascual of the duo Cooking Sections look at the world through the lens of food. Their long-term project Climavore promotes the idea of adapting food production and consumption to climate change. Last year the pair built a structure in Skye that functions both as an oyster farm at high tide and a dining table at low tide, where convivial discussions are held with residents, farmers, politicians and fishermen about viable alternatives to Skye's damaging salmon farming industry. "One of the great things we learned at the centre was how do you really engage with these different stakeholders and agents working in the field?" says Schwabe.</p>
      <p>The centre grew out of the lack of an architecture discipline at Goldsmiths, but given the college's long history of experimentation and activism, it was never going to be a traditional course. "There was a sense that new social and political conditions were unfolding in which new practices and thinkers were urgently needed," says centre director Susan Schuppli, whose own practice explores the legal and aesthetic implications of damaged ecologies and pollution. Her recent project Nature Represents Itself used aerial, underwater and satellite imagery, as well as CGI simulation, to argue that the swirling oil slick from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico amounted to a kind of camera-less photography, a chemical reaction caused by hydrocarbon atoms interacting with water and sunlight.</p>
      <p>Weizman launched the centre as a peer-to-peer PhD programme and brought in like-minded thinkers such as curator Anselm Franke, film-maker Angela Melitopoulos and Céline Condorelli, an artist and architect. This first phase of the centre was known as Round Table One, because a huge round table was the gathering point for fierce debates among participants and guest speakers. They realised their combined intellectual resources could be a powerful practical tool. "What made Round Table so unique was it didn't have to deliver architects," says Condorelli. "Architecture is very much a methodology used to look at the world, it's not an object of study at the CRA."</p>
      <p>Since those early days, CRA graduates have spearheaded innovations in diverse fields. Lebanese-British practitioner Helene Kazan is pushing to extend international law to further protect the individual in conflict zones. Her video Masking Tape Intervention: Lebanon 1989 takes as its starting point her father's photo of their kitchen with masking tape gridding the window to prevent shelling from shattering the glass during Lebanon's civil war. Paulo Tavares focuses on land and human rights violations in Amazonia, using complex mapping of plants and trees, as well as testimonies from indigenous communities, to argue for the forest to have legal rights as a civic entity.</p>
      <p>The sea is the arena of Lorenzo Pezzani and film-maker Charles Heller, together known as Forensic Oceanography. Their 2011 project The Left-to-Die Boat drew on an astonishing array of surveillance tools to document the case of a distressed migrant boat from Libya that was left to drift for two weeks without intervention from nearby Nato vessels, resulting in the death of 63 migrants.</p>
      <p>For its Turner prize show, Forensic Architecture's multimedia display unravelled the cover-up of the killing of a Bedouin Palestinian teacher by Israeli police during a demolition operation in a Bedouin village. "[The police] were absolutely stunned by the level of analysis that was unleashed on the case. Never has there been a group of modellers, architects, sound analysts doing that. We just decided to focus on that case because we thought it was paradigmatic enough," says Weizman. Sifting through information displayed in film, maps, tweets and models is a big ask of the viewer, but it's impossible not to be gripped by the unfolding narrative that's all the more shocking because it's real.</p>
      <p>It's a different set of tools to understand the world and change perspectives. Is it art, journalism, documentary film-making, or architecture? Maybe it's all of the above</p>
      <p>Of course the question that comes up from viewers - and even other artists - is: where's the art? One might trace research architecture's lineage to the protest art of the 60s, to social realism, to relational aesthetics, which focuses on social engagement, and to the activist strain of much post-internet art. But ultimately does it matter if it doesn't conform to conventional notions of art?</p>
      <p>"What Forensic Architecture propose is a different language," says ICA director Stefan Kalmár. "It's a different set of tools to understand the world and change perspectives. Is it art, journalism, documentary film-making, or architecture? Maybe it's all of the above or maybe it's a new art form. We don't know."</p>
      <p>In fact, galleries can be vital forums for the public to access such evidence of state and corporate abuse. Thousands of people saw Forensic Architecture's exhibition at the 2017 art festival Documenta in Kassel, Germany, showing its investigation into alleged state collusion in a neo-Nazi racist killing in the city - which put pressure on the German parliamentary inquiry to accept their findings as evidence in the legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>"Every time we expose a violation, we crack a little bit the monopoly that states and governments think they have over information around incidents or around battlefields," says Weizman. "They think they control the space militarily, imagistically and analytically. Every time you break that, they need to realign, to change the ways they work."</p>

      <title>The journey to sister and brother: my children in photographs</title>
      <subtitle>After the birth of his son, Gavan Naden took a photograph of the baby with his sister. Each month throughout their childhood, he did the same. The result is a testament to the siblings' bond</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>I used to be a photographer. But then I used to be lots of things: a punk, a new romantic and, for a short period, a tie-wearing accountant. These were fleeting phases and, although they once felt incredibly important, over time they have faded into history.</p>
      <p>But when my children were born, I knew this phase would last for ever: fatherhood was never going to register as a "used to be" section on my CV. I was in it for the long haul. I wrote in a diary, as if to ensure I never forgot, "This is the best thing that ever happened to me", which, although trite, has proved to be absolutely true.</p>
      <p>It is one of those jobs you struggle to learn without doing it. Parenting books pointed me in the right direction, but nothing could prepare me properly and, anyway, I was at the age when I believed there was certainty in life.</p>
      <p>I was told to enjoy every minute because the time would flash past. I scoffed because the early years seemed anything but fast - in fact, they crawled along. It was a period of little sleep, constant colic, tiny fingers fiddling around electrical sockets and unexplained tantrums. It all drove me to distraction. I couldn't wait for the kids to grow up.</p>
      <p>Now I realise I should have been more careful what I wished for.</p>
      <p>Luckily, my subconscious ignored my irritation and the day my son was born I picked up a camera again. Then on the same day of every month I took a seemingly unremarkable photograph of my two children together.</p>
      <p>I wasn't interested in posed or carefully orchestrated shots and, for the first few years, I used a Polaroid camera, so there was no editing, no Photoshopping. Those pictures are now slightly faded and yellowing, which adds a nice element of authenticity. I only graduated to using my phone to take photographs when the films became harder to find. Yet looking back, most are completely unremarkable images of a brother and sister in similar poses.</p>
      <p>In one, I can just detect that my daughter has a broken arm; in another, so does my son. Hers was the result of an off-road accident when she was thrown from a trailer; his after a tackle on the football pitch. The feeling of protectiveness and hopelessness during moments such as these was overwhelming.</p>
      <p>When my son was a baby, I rushed him to A&amp;E armed with a note from an out-of-hours GP. He had been ill for days and was now severely dehydrated and floppy. The harassed staff were staring at a guy with a knife in his neck surrounded by the police and, after refusing to read my letter, pointed me to the seating area to wait my turn. I was petrified my son would suddenly stop breathing. When called through to triage, he was immediately placed on a drip and slept the night on my chest.</p>
      <p>Because of this incident, I hated the thought of my children being ill so I accentuated the healthy by photographing them whenever possible with a ball in their hands, riding horses, or out in the open, atop a windy hill or on a beach. It was proof that they were "up and at 'em" kids, who loved their sports and the outdoors. The fact my son slipped off his horse asleep at the reins was best left unrecorded.</p>
      <p>As they grew and their personalities became more apparent, it wasn't just the change in their height or dress sense that made me stop in my tracks. It was the way they reacted with mock horror to the Polaroid camera appearing from behind my back. Turning away, giving a "talk to the hand" gesture and the flash of irritation at having to sit still for a second were all part of their performance. At times, we were all driving each other mad and that is plain to see. The clues are behind the eyes.</p>
      <p>Yet whatever has happened along the way, I can instinctively see when something is wrong. As when my son's cheeky-chappie smile was replaced by a tight-lipped frown because, that day, some kids at school had pushed his head in the sandpit. And my daughter's averted eyes after discovering the jam tarts she had delighted in baking with me were, in fact, premade ones that I substituted straight from a Mr Kipling pack of six.</p>
      <p>The school uniforms don't give away as much as the pictures pinned to the walls in the background and the subtle changes in pose. And there comes a point when the two siblings swap roles. Suddenly the younger one, my son, grows so much taller and places his protective arm around his smaller but older sister. I never noticed this at the time.</p>
      <p>We were all sitting together the other day when my daughter asked to check out the old photographs, complaining about how she looked ridiculous mostly. Then my son flicked through the whole lot, minutely examining his changing hairstyle. They both laughed fondly - mainly at me for the time I had spent compiling all these images.</p>
      <p>I felt a momentary glow of victory, not because they were appreciative of what I had done and could laugh at the memory of it all, but because of the bond between them. That is the most striking and perhaps one of the most satisfying parts of being a parent. Just knowing they are there for one another.</p>
      <p>Those images through the years, while an aide memoire, are also a testament to the relationship between them - and that is something I cherish.</p>

      <title>The unfinished war: Afghans are still dying as air strikes go on. But no one is counting: Bombing blunders and misleading information on the ground keep the civilian toll rising in Afghanistan. In a three-part investigation Guardian writers examine the unanswered questions of the war on terror. Today: How many innocent people are dying?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Fardin's world caved in on a bright Sunday morning last October when an American bomb came through the roof of the room where he was sleeping. He was spared physically. But the six-year-old has not uttered a word nor taken a step since.</p>
      <p>At a quarter to eight on the morning of October 21, exactly two weeks after central command in Florida started bombing the Taliban into submission and al-Qaida into flight, an F-18 airplane circling overhead dropped its ordnance on the north Kabul hovel that Fardin's and three other families shared.</p>
      <p>The little girl next door lost both her eyes. Sardar Muhammad, 22, leapt out of bed in his room at the bottom of the gar den and ran outside to watch the airshow. A piece of shrapnel in the head killed him instantly.</p>
      <p>The neighbour, Muhammad Sarwar, 50, lost his wife Aziza and seven other family members. "Maybe he wasn't a very good pilot," he murmurs. "We like the Americans."</p>
      <p>The bomb, in a poor and thickly populated district on the capital's northern fringe, turned the two affected houses into a miniature earthquake zone of rubble, craters, and scattered household junk - a shredded patchwork quilt here, bits of a red and black carpet there, piles of smashed crockery and old cooking pots. The precision of the strike left the little disaster zone enclosed behind the walls of the two houses.</p>
      <p>The roof collapsed on the first floor where Fardin was asleep. He was left speechless by the trauma and so paralysed by fear that he has not walked since.</p>
      <p>On the same autumn day that the Americans killed nine Afghan civilians here, nine children perished to the south when the tractor and trailer in which they were travelling was bombed in Uruzgan province. And to the west in Herat dozens of civilians died when a 1,000lb cluster pod spilt its 202 yellow pea bomblets across a mosque and hospital complex.</p>
      <p>They were all innocent victims of Washington's war on terror, part of the steadily mounting toll of civilian casualties still being inflicted on Afghanistan despite the collapse of the Taliban and the dispersal of Osama bin Laden's Islamist international. They are what have become known as "collateral damage", like "ethnic cleansing" a chilling and cliched euphemism of the past 10 years. The Afghans are wearily familiar with death - 10 years of war against the Russians, civil war between the mojahedin in the early 1990s, the Taliban's bloody conquest and consolidation of power.</p>
      <p>In a country where death is so ubiquitous, killing a habit, and war has been a constant for an entire generation, few are bothering to count the casualties mounting from more than four months of US action. For the Pentagon, the Afghan war has been a triumph, the perfection of hi-tech combat techniques practised 10 years ago in the Gulf war and honed in the Kosovo campaign of 1999. The rapid victory at a minimal cost to American lives has helped to lay the ghost of Vietnam.</p>
      <p>But as the international focus shifts from war to a fragile peace and to the rebuilding of post-Taliban Afghanistan, the war still raises several unsettling questions about the price of the Pax Americana. The first and most obvious question in this unfinished war is how many civilians have died. There is no easy answer. Somehow in the middle of America's hi-tech, Dollars 1bn a month bombing blizzard, the simple matter of keeping a tally of civilian casualties has been overlooked.</p>
      <p>'Please don't ask'</p>
      <p>There are no official US figures, and nor have the dozens of non-governmental charities now operating in the country done any independent research. "Undoubtedly there have been civilian casualties," says a well-informed Afghan professional working for an NGO mainly funded by the US government.</p>
      <p>"No one is doing a real assessment of that. It gets very political. Please don't ask me about that."</p>
      <p>"There's collateral damage in every conflict, but I don't feel comfortable talking about it," echoed a UN official in Kabul.</p>
      <p>Despite the manipulation of casualty figures for propaganda purposes by both pro-war apologists and anti-war activists, it is already clear that the number of civilian dead from the bombing vastly exceeds the estimated 500 killed by US air strikes during the 78-day Kosovo war, and may also be higher than the 3,200 Iraqi civilians believed killed during the Gulf war.</p>
      <p>"A lot of civilians are clearly being killed or injured. It's definitely in the four figures," says a UN source.</p>
      <p>The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres says: "MSF increasingly sees evidence of an unacceptably high number of Afghan civilian casualties from the military operations."</p>
      <p>A senior MSF worker, who has been in Afghanistan for five years, estimates the number of civilian dead at between 2,000 and 3,000, based on reports from hospitals and field workers around the country.</p>
      <p>Some analysts say more than 60 Afghan civilians are being killed daily on average since the bombing began on October 7. A European demining expert in Kabul who works closely with the Pentagon reckons that up to 8,000 civilians have been killed.</p>
      <p>The September 11 toll in the US is now put at just under 3,000 dead. In a new study, Carl Conetta of the Commonwealth Institute estimates that up to 1,300 civilians have been killed by US bombs and at least 3,000 other Afghans are dead because the American campaign worsened the humanitarian emergency.</p>
      <p>Professor Marc Herold, of the University of New Hampshire, puts the number of civilian casualties at at least 4,000. Prof Herold, a leftwing anti-war activist, is one of the few seeking to establish the death toll, tabulating it daily from media reports. In his words, he wants "to put the record straight" and claims his is a "comprehensive accounting" even though it is being conducted from a computer terminal in America, and not from first-hand reporting inside Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>He calculates that 3,742 civilians had died by December 3. Scores more have died since. Sceptics argue that his figures are exaggerated. He insists they are conservative.</p>
      <p>"It's a good first go," says Sam Zarifi, of Human Rights Watch in New York, which had two researchers on the Pakistani-Afghan border for 11 weeks trying to get a picture of the toll. It has a database of 300 strikes it wants to investigate for civilian casualties.</p>
      <p>What is certain is that Prof Herold's work is incomplete. Some of the strikes he records duplicate one another, others are fictional. For example, he has up to 19 women dying in a Kabul maternity ward around October 8 when a bomb fell on or near the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital.</p>
      <p>Isatullah, the head nurse at the hospital's emergency department, is one of the few people in Kabul keeping a list of the dead from the bombing. He produces six A4 pages listing the names of 115 male bomb victims. Forty of them died. There is another list of 37 women, 10 of whom died.</p>
      <p>"The Taliban ordered me to make the list for propaganda against America. I had to make the list. They were the bosses," he explains. "But there was no force, and there were no lies on the list."</p>
      <p>But no bomb hit the hospital, and there have been no maternity ward casualties. But if the American professor is recording non-existent casualties, the obverse also applies since so many deaths have not been reported in the international media on which his data depends.</p>
      <p>"You can probably double Herold's figure because so much goes unreported here," the demining expert says. "Most Muslims are buried within six hours of death. There's no need to report births or deaths here and the hospitals do not have anything on the dead."</p>
      <p>Not included in the professor's statistics, for example, because it has not been reported until now, is the attack on the village of Moshkhil in the south-eastern province of Paktika. Three air strikes within 12 hours on December 5 and 6 left 16 people dead. The villagers insist there were no Taliban in the vicinity and no military targets.</p>
      <p>On the afternoon of December 5, recounts a man from the village who gives his name as Rashid, a US plane bombed two cars, killing two brothers and a sister. An hour later an armed stranger on a motorbike sped through Moshkhil asking the locals where "the guests" (meaning Taliban or al-Qaida) were staying. There were no guests, he was told. Within an hour another US plane bombed an empty car. Then at half past three the next morning the planes returned, bombing a mosque and destroying it as well as seven adjacent houses. Thirteen people died as they slept.</p>
      <p>"Why did they bomb my village?" asks Rashid, who lost two relatives. "It could not have been stray bombs since they bombed three times. It must have been a blunder."</p>
      <p>Blunders</p>
      <p>There have inevitably been plenty of "blunders", from the striking of Red Cross warehouses to the killing of anti-Taliban fighters, caused by stray bombs, mistakes and bad or deliberately skewed intelligence. The Pentagon factors in a 10% failure rate for the 11,315 bombs it had dropped by December 5 and only a 6% failure rate for the controversial cluster bombs, although demining experts now dealing with the fallout put the cluster failure rate at up to 22%.</p>
      <p>Most civilians have died where the fighting and the bombing have been the most intense - the November battle for the Taliban's last northern stronghold of Kunduz, the early December onslaught on the Tora Bora caves complex south of the eastern town of Jalalabad, the campaign to capture the cradle of the Taliban, Kandahar in the south.</p>
      <p>There was barely a fight for Kabul. The Northern Alliance lost four men taking the capital. But the concentration of military targets in and around the city means that an estimated 100 civilians died in the bombing.</p>
      <p>Most of those killed are as a result of "mistakes" during high-altitude bombing, the central feature of modern American war-making, which wreaks havoc on the ground but keeps US servicemen in a relatively risk-free environment in the skies.</p>
      <p>But in the past few weeks, there has been increasing evidence of how the Americans are also being drawn in on the ground, committing errors after being lured into local feuds.</p>
      <p>In recent days CIA agents have been visiting a southern village doling out millions of dollars in compensation to relatives of men killed by US special forces who stormed Uruzgan village, guns blazing, in the hours of darkness on January 24. The Americans got the wrong men.</p>
      <p>The bodies of two men were found shot dead with their hands tied behind their backs with plastic tape, suggesting that they had been bound and then executed. Read Admiral John Stufflebeem, of the US joint chiefs of staff, told journalists in Washington that the two men could have been handcuffed by local Afghans.</p>
      <p>"That explains what we're talking about in terms of those bound and found dead," he said.</p>
      <p>But western officials in Kabul said that in a night raid on another southern village last month near the town of Gardez, US special forces used the tape to bind local women. In both cases, houses or buildings were torched. In both cases, locals and western sources insist, the increasingly desperate hunt for al-Qaida and Taliban remnants targeted anti-Taliban forces loyal to the interim government of Hamid Karzai.</p>
      <p>In Uruzgan village, the charred corpses of a dozen men were found among at least 21 dead. In the village near Gardez, western sources say, the Americans tied up the women and then took hair samples, apparently for DNA analysis to ascertain whether they might have been part of Bin Laden's extended family.</p>
      <p>"This sort of thing seems to be quite common now. There's so much resentment now in the south-east," a source says.</p>
      <p>The man the Americans were looking for was a member of the local anti-Taliban council and had been cooperating with the new government in Kabul. "But he was quarrelling with someone who has the ear of the Americans," the source says.</p>
      <p>The raids suggest that the special forces shoot first and ask questions later. In both villages there were no US deaths although one American sustained a foot injury.</p>
      <p>The botched operations may be explained by poor US intelligence. They must also partly be caused by the "bodybag syndrome" - the fear of US casualties which is forcing American forces into dependence on unsavoury characters on the ground who are tricking them into fighting their feuds for them.</p>
      <p>The ground "errors" were preceded by several other strikes in which Afghan warlords coaxed the Americans into bombing their rivals, claiming that the targets were hostile forces. The International Committee of the Red Cross is investigating the deaths of at least 52 civilians on December 29 at Qalaye Niazi, south-east of Kabul, when a B-52 and two B-1B bombers struck after a regional warlord told the Americans it was a Taliban stronghold. It was not. At least 25 children were killed, according to the UN.</p>
      <p>There have been several such attacks in the same region. The Moshkhil villagers think that the "blunder" that left 16 dead there followed a malicious tip-off from a former anti-Taliban village chief who wants his old job back.</p>
      <p>Standing amid the rubble of the former frontline hill village of Isterghich, north of Kabul, Zakriyah, 38, brags about ordering the US strike on his native village that left four women dead. It was a Taliban-held village. Zakriyah was away on the other side of the lines. "I passed on all the information. The Americans bombed. They missed the Taliban and hit next door."</p>
      <p>The Taliban are gone. Zakriyah is now back as the village chief, the four women sacrificed on the altar of his ambition.</p>
      <p>A similar trend appears to be occurring at the broader political level, with the Northern Alliance officials running Kabul and dominating the interim government taking advantage of the current atmosphere to get the Americans to wipe out their perceived foes in the south.</p>
      <p>In the post-Taliban phase of the war, the bombing has been concentrated for the past month on the south and south-eastern areas by the Pakistani border where support for the Taliban was strong. General Basir Salangi, a former Northern Alliance commander who is now Kabul's security chief, says the Americans should carry on bombing the Pashtun south: "If they're not al-Qaida, they're the people who supported al-Qaida. They should be bombed just to frighten them."</p>
      <p>There is little doubt the war in Afghanistan has been a triumph of American might. But out of sight and out of mind, day after day, in dribs and drabs, a lot of ordinary people are dying in a war that sees the most advanced fighting machine ever assembled doing its killing in one of the most backward societies on earth.</p>
      <p>The results: just two Americans killed by hostile fire to set against thousands of dead Afghan non-combatants. Is this civilian death toll warranted?</p>
      <p>The Pentagon responds with age-old axioms about the inevitable and unfortunate collateral of war. "This has been the most accurate war ever fought in this nation's history," the campaign commander, General Tommy Franks, insisted in Washington last week.</p>
      <p>That conclusion is contested by Carl Conetta, of the Commonwealth Institute, who calculates that the so-called smartbombs and high-precision strikes have been a lot less accurate in Afghanistan than they were two years ago in Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>"Despite the adulation of Operation Enduring Freedom as a 'finely tuned' or 'bulls-eye' war, the campaign failed to set a new standard for precision in one important respect: the rate of civilians killed per bomb dropped," he says.</p>
      <p>"In fact, this rate was far higher in the Afghanistan conflict - perhaps four times higher - than in the 1999 Balkans war."</p>
      <p>Night raids Where US has struck</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the year the focus of the bombing and the increasing resort to night raids on the ground by commandos have been in the provinces of Paktika and Paktia, including the town of Khost, in the south-east, unruly Pashtun tribal areas where support for the Taliban was strongest.</p>
      <p>Zhawar Kili in Paktia, where villagers say many civilians were killed in bombing last month, was hit last week by a Hellfire missile fired by an unmanned Predator drone. Between one and three men were believed killed in what the Americans described as an attack on al-Qaida suspects.</p>
      <p>US special forces and forensics experts are now at the site gathering evidence, including pieces of corpses for DNA analysis to assist identity checks.</p>
      <p>Cave complexes in the same area were heavily bombed in mid-January, destroying 35 houses in one nearby village. Night raids have been conducted on villages in Gardez and Uruzgan south of Kabul in recent weeks. At least 52 civilians, including 25 children, died in the bombing of Qalaye Niazi at the end of December, according to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is making a rare investigation of the attack.</p>

      <title>Obituary: Joe Cahill: A founder of the Provisional IRA and one of the architects of its urban guerrilla terrorism, in the 1990s he promoted the peace process</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The life of Joe Cahill, who has died aged 84 from asbestosis, was violently dedicated to the cause of a united Ireland. As a teenager, he escaped hanging for murder and, nearly 30 uncompromising years later, he helped found the Provisional IRA, setting new standards of brutality as one of the principal architects of its urban guerrilla terrorism.</p>
      <p>During the years since, he has remained a pivotal figure, not least because of his position at the heart of the web of money-raising and gun-running conduits he spun, most notably in Libya and the United States.</p>
      <p>Altogether he served over 15 years in custody in the two Irish jurisdictions and, ultimately, with some 60 years association with the Republican movement, used his authority and influence to promote the pragmatic peace strategy of the 1990s to IRA activists.</p>
      <p>Cahill was a short, thin, bald man invariably dressed in a nondescript overcoat and cap. In the era of power-suited Republicans articulating the IRA cause, the aged and frail Cahill seemed a figure from a bygone age. But in an organisation obsessed with the rightness of its cause and the purity of its bloodline to the rebels of the 1916 Easter Rising, Cahill was an icon of continuity and legitimacy which further secured his importance in validating IRA strategy.</p>
      <p>He was born in the Divis Street area of Belfast, where his father ran a small printworks to support his five sons and four daughters. He attended the nearby St Mary's Christian Brothers school, which he left as soon as he reached his 14th birthday. At first he followed his father into printing, but soon left to become a joiner.</p>
      <p>He later claimed to have been politicised by the outdoor relief riots in 1932, when Catholic and Protestant workers all too briefly joined forces in a vain attempt to compel the Unionist government to tackle unemployment more vigorously. By the time he was 17, however, any cross-community instincts the young Cahill might once have nurtured were extinguished, for he had identified himself with the Republican movement. By the time the second world war had broken out, he had graduated from the Fianna, the youth movement, into the outlawed IRA and become a gunman.</p>
      <p>In 1942, the organisation decided to march to mark the anniversary of the Easter Rising. Cahill was one of a gang assigned to distract police attention by opening fire on a patrol. Constable Patrick Murphy died, and the gang surrendered. All were later sentenced to death, but apart from Tom Williams, 19, who had been wounded, the others were reprieved four days before they were due to hang. Cahill remained in jail until 1949. Soon afterwards, he worked for a couple of years in the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, where he suffered no harassment from the Protestant workforce, but did contract asbestosis, which earned him compensation of £30,000 last May.</p>
      <p>When the IRA launched its next campaign in December 1956, Cahill was one of the first interned without trial and the last to be released after it collapsed and was finally called off in 1962. Although he remained committed to Republican ideals, he took a back seat as the IRA moved into a new phase of social and economic agitation. However, towards the end of the decade, with the resurgence of sectarian conflict, Cahill was privately critical of the way the IRA was running down its military capability.</p>
      <p>So, after the growing disorder which culminated in British troops being put on the streets in August 1969, Cahill was acutely humiliated when C atholics welcomed the troops with tea and cake and daubed "IRA? I ran away" on the gable ends of his native west Belfast. "The reception for the army brought tears to my eyes," he said later. "People collaborated with the enemy because the IRA had betrayed them."</p>
      <p>Soon afterwards he was one of the prime movers in a coup which supplanted the discredited IRA in Belfast with a new Provisional IRA, which quickly declared its allegiance to "the 32-county Irish Republic declared at Easter 1916, established by Dail Eireann (the Irish Parliament) in 1919, betrayed by partition in 1922 and suppressed by the British ever since". Cahill was elected to its first army council and soon afterwards took over as the IRA commander in Belfast, where he initiated a campaign of violence, prompting the authorities to plan the introduction of internment without trial in the belief that it would curb, if not crush, the new Provos.</p>
      <p>The operation was launched on August 9 1971, when some 400 suspects were arrested. That evening in Belfast, Cahill took part in a news conference at a Ballymurphy school, boasting, with a justification underlined by his own presence, that the IRA leadership had escaped the swoop. He provocatively claimed that a woman sympathiser at Stormont had given them 48 hours' warning.</p>
      <p>Over the next quarter of a century, more than 3,000 people died in the Troubles. As the violence escalated, British political leaders began exploring pathways to peace with the IRA. On March 13 1972, during a 72-hour ceasefire, Cahill was one of an IRA delegation who met the opposition leader, Harold Wilson, at a clandestine meeting in Dublin. Cahill described the encounter as "a waffling session, a complete waste of bloody time".</p>
      <p>Another peace initiative, this time involving Northern Ireland Secretary William Whitelaw, foundered in July 1972. An Irish MP met Cahill at a house in Dublin in a last-ditch bid to save a further ceasefire, but during the conversation Cahill, clearly forewarned, interrupted the pleading and turned on the television news, where first reports of the Bloody Friday bombings, which left 11 dead in 26 explosions, were coming in. "That's the way it's got to be," said an unapologetic Cahill. The MP rushed outside and was sick in the garden.</p>
      <p>Later that year, the Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gadafy pledged support for Irish revolutionaries fighting Britain. In December, Cahill, by now in charge of IRA procurement, slipped out to Tripoli to cash in on the offer.</p>
      <p>The following March, the cargo ship Claudia was intercepted off the Irish coast, inbound from Libya, with a five-ton arsenal of weaponry. Cahill was one of six arrested and was later sentenced to three years' penal servitude.</p>
      <p>He was released from prison early because of poor health, but it did not curtail his activities. From time to time there were public pointers to his importance. In 1982, the Irish courts confiscated $ 80,000 dollars cash from him after police witnessed a hand-over in a Dublin cafe. Two years later he was deported from the United States in another bid to disrupt his supply routes there.</p>
      <p>In 1986 he sided with the Gerry Adams faction in yet another IRA internal split, which helped prepare the ground for the eventual peace process. When this strategy eventually came to fruition in 1994, Cahill was deployed to sell it to key supporters in the United States. The US authorities balked at allowing him in, however, and it required the Irish prime minister, Albert Reynolds, to intercede with President Bill Clinton. "Have you seen this man's record?" asked the president. "Sure, there's no saints in the IRA," replied Reynolds. The visa was granted and Cahill travelled to New York, where he performed his last significant service to the Republican cause, signing up supporters to the "peace process".</p>
      <p>In 2003, Cahill received a standing ovation at Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin when he told delegates: "We have won the war, now let us win the peace." To the end of his life, he remained committed to the process and to Adams, its main proponent, even though he well knew it would not deliver the united Ireland he had so long and so violently pursued.</p>
      <p>In 1956 he married Annie Magee. She survives him, along with their son and six daughters.</p>

      <title>G2: Inside story: Don't. Be. Silly.: In extracts from his new book publishedin the Guardian, Martin Amis accused the British left - including his closest friend - of overlooking the crimes of Stalin's Russia. In an open letter, that friend Christopher Hitchens gives his side of the story</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Dearest Martin,</p>
      <p>You know how it is with kind friends. If a disobliging word is published about one, in, let's say, the letters column of the Sheep-Shearer's Gazette in the south island of New Zealand, they will take infinite pains to get word of it to you by fax or email. So I have lately been reading bushels of stuff about myself, generated by reviews of your book on Stalinism. I wince on my own behalf a good deal as I wade through, but I don't forget to wince for you as well. Hardened as I am to hostile or philistine reviews, I can still imagine that you must be at least disappointed by the treatment you have been getting. And in a way it must be worse than all that journo-sludge concerning your teeth or your divorce, because the subject that's being slighted here is the grave and momentous one of the victims of "Koba".</p>
      <p>My sympathy is tinged with annoyance, all the same. What did you imagine would happen if you elected to write on such a Himalayan topic, and then pygmified it by addressing so much of it to me? If you remember, I did try to warn you about this over a year ago. I find myself embarrassed almost every day at the thought of an actual gulag survivor reading this, or even reading about it, and finding his or her experience reduced to a sub-Leavisite boys' tiff, gleefully interpreted as literary fratricide by hacks who couldn't care a hoot for the real subject.</p>
      <p>As it happens, I think that there are passages of really magnificent endeavour in your book, but anyone who wants to know where and how I differ on the history and the analysis can direct their jolly search engines to my mega-review in the AtlanticMonthly (http:/www.theatlantic.com/issues/2002/09/hitchens.htm).</p>
      <p>I also thought it would be churlish to pass up the "open letter" invitation that you extend in your sarcastically headed "Comrade Hitchens" chapter. Aside from the distressing matter of proportion that I just mentioned, and the question of your sources and interpretations, there also remains our political disagreement. In what you claim to recall of my views, and of the views of James Fenton, there is an unpardonable assumption that the left of 68 was not only morally null about Stalin, but also frivolous and selfish. I am not going to let this pass. I've lived to see the brave and serious and self-sacrificing war-resisters of the Vietnam era written off as draft-dodgers and privileged sissies, which is to say that I've seen a huge lie become widely accepted. You help circulate part of this lie yourself, when you echo the fantastic assertion, originally fabricated by paranoid reactionaries, that American soldiers returned from Vietnam to face "execration". And here is how you perform your duty to memory, about events with which you did have a nodding acquaintance:</p>
      <p>"In my first year at Oxford (autumn 1968) I attended a demonstration against the resuppression of Czechoslovakia. Some 60 or 70 souls were present. We heard speeches. The mood was sorrowful, decent. Compare this to the wildly peergroup-competitive but definitely unfakable emotings and self-lacerations of the crowds outside the American embassy in Grosvenor Square, where they gathered in their tens of thousands."</p>
      <p>I wince again at the sly way you contrast your own sorrowful decency to the unseemly saturnalia of the time, but as you perfectly well know I was one of the organisers of that event in Oxford, and James Fenton was there too (in a crowd, incidentally, that contained many more "souls" than you say). The group of which I was then a member, the International Socialists, organised pro-Czech events around the country and even managed to fling leaflets in Russian on to the decks of Soviet merchant vessels in British ports. I was actually in Cuba on the day of the invasion, and managed to distribute some "anti-Soviet" materials on the streets of Havana. I'm reasonably proud of that, though if you had asked me at the time, I'd have been proudest of having hosted Dr Eduardo Mondlane, the founder of Frelimo, at a reception in my tiny college room. He was murdered shortly afterwards by the Portuguese secret police, but he's still remembered as the gentle and highly civilised father of Mozambican independence and the impetus given to revolution in southern Africa that year has now resulted, at some remove, in the triumph of Nelson Mandela.</p>
      <p>How you know about Grosvenor Square I can't imagine: I'm willing to testify that there was some "emoting" all right, and that there could well have been more - the My Lai massacre had occurred only the day before, though we didn't quite realise it. The "lacerations", though, were supplied - as in Chicago and Paris and elsewhere - by the forces of law and order.</p>
      <p>You say sneeringly that the "New Left" of the 60s represented "revolution as play" and that its "death throes" took the form of "vanguard terrorism". The atom of truth in this - or the grain of received wisdom - doesn't excuse you. That year, the unstoppable fusion of the American civil rights movement with the largest-ever citizen movement against a war - a war of atrocity and aggression about which we now know that everything we even suspected was true - brought about the legal emancipation of black America, and compelled the warmakers to begin their retreat. Not bad. Not bad at all - even if there were a few hippies and druggies and freaks involved here and there (though I can't resist adding that there wasn't much hedonism on the battlefields of Mozambique). If I am embarrassed to recall anything about my politics at that time - and I'll admit to the odd wince - it is chiefly because I wish I had done very much more than I did.</p>
      <p>What else was happening that year? Well, the West German comrades - led by a young Rudi Dutschke who had escaped from East Berlin - launched a critical movement that broke the shady silence of the post-Third Reich consensus. In France, the 10-year period of one-man rule was abruptly and, yes, if you insist, joyously terminated. Much of southern and Nato Europe was under military dictatorship at the time: I still see old friends from Spain and Portugal and Greece whose activities in those days meant the breaking-open of prison states only a short while later. Most interesting of all, in my memory, was the direct confrontation this involved with Stalin's heirs. Our faction at any rate was in close touch with student and worker groups in Poland and Czechoslovakia, where open rebellion against the sclerotic Warsaw pact regimes was breaking out. The regimes themselves seemed to get the point. Moscow directly ordered the French Communist party to help put down the rebellion against De Gaulle, and Brezhnev both sought and received Lyndon Johnson's advance assurance that a Red Army invasion of Prague would be considered an "internal affair".</p>
      <p>For a short, exhilarating while, it seemed that the permafrost could be melted from below. And this idea did not experience any "death throes". It became subterranean, and re-emerged in 1989. Of the dissident heroes of that later revolution, I can think of several who I first met on or around the barricades of 1968. And many of them also did tremendous work in helping to save the people of Bosnia a few years further on.</p>
      <p>Not long ago, I took part in quite a serious discussion, initiated by the man who had served the longest term of imprisonment in communist Yugoslavia, about naming a street in the Kosovo capital of Pristina after Leon Trotsky. (You make rather a boast of not having read the Old Man, but his book of reportage on the 1912 Balkan wars is one of the finest polemics ever composed, not to say one of the most prescient.)</p>
      <p>Some exemplary people and causes, in other words, could not be said to be quite decided on the lethal question of bolshevism: the only revolution that had ever defeated its enemies. That there was an element of power-worship here I'm quite prepared to concede, and those involved, including myself, are obliged to subject themselves to self-criticism. But your attempted syllogism invites a direct comparison with Hitlerism, and levels the suggestion of moral equivalence to the Nazis at, say, the many "hard left" types who worked for Dr Martin Luther King. My provisional critique of this ahistorical reasoning would fit into three short italicised sentences. Don't . Be . Silly</p>
      <p>I see from some of the more vulgar and stupid responses to your book that the spectre of Trotskyism once again stalks the land and I think I am in a strong position to promise you that all such talk is idle. It's over. But how would you know that? You report on how you took the pedantic trouble to ask me - should it be Trotskyist or Trotskyite? And you add that I told you several times that only Stalinists or ignorant people say the latter. And then you go and call the POUM - George Orwell's party - "Trotskyite".</p>
      <p>By the way, that's a factual error as well as an aesthetic one, and I wish it was the only such. A poor return for my labours, I must say. I am glad I didn't try to tell you any more about Rosa Luxemburg, who was probably more of a historical heroine to us, not least because her warnings about Leninism had been the earliest, not to say the most lucid and courageous. But then one had to face the argument that if she and her comrades had been more ruthless and more Leninist, the militarist German right might have been crushed in 1919 instead of, with infinitely more suffering and woe, in 1945. This is and was a deeply serious and troubling question (though I must say that its least serious consequence is that you have pissed me off by making light of it).</p>
      <p>You demand that people - you prefer the term "intellectuals" - give an account of their attitude to the Stalin terror. Irritatingly phrased though your demand may be, I say without any reservation that you are absolutely right to make it. A huge number of liberals and conservatives and social democrats, as well as communists, made a shabby pact with "Koba", or succumbed to the fascinations of his power. Winston Churchill told Stalin's ambassador to London, before the war, that he had quite warmed to the old bastard after the Moscow Trials, which had at least put down the cosmopolitan revolutionaries who Churchill most hated. TS Eliot returned the manuscript of Animal Farm to George Orwell, well knowing that his refusal might condemn it to non-publication, because he objected to its "Trotskyite" tone. (You can read all about this illuminating episode in my little book on Orwell.) I think we can say fairly that the names of Churchill and Eliot are still highly regarded in conservative political and cultural circles. You have a certain reputation for handling irony and paradox. How could you miss an opportunity like this, and sound off like a Telegraph editorialist instead, hugging the shore and staying with the script?</p>
      <p>However, while all of those and many other dirty compromises were being made, the Bulletin of the Left Opposition was publishing exactly the details, of famine and murder and deportation and misery, that now shock you so much. I evidently wasted my breath in telling you this, but there exists a historical tradition of Marxist writers - Victor Serge, CLR James, Boris Souvarine and others - who exposed and opposed Stalin while never ceasing to fight against empire and fascism and exploitation. If the moral and historical audit is to be properly drawn up, then I would unhesitatingly propose the members of this derided, defeated diaspora, whose closest British analogue and ally was Orwell, as the ones who come best out of the several hells of the last century. A pity that you felt them beneath your notice.</p>
      <p>Your letter to me is addressed from what sounds like a pretty cushy spot in Uruguay, where you sometimes repair. You make it appear idyllic - "a place of thousand-mile beaches". As you have probably heard, it has been calculated that during the 1970s, one tenth of the Uruguayan population was forced into exile, while one in every 50 of the remainder was processed through the military and police prison system and that in those prisons new heights of innovation - especially but by no means exclusively in psychological torture - were attained. (Behaviourism was involved; detainees were forced to watch Charlie Chaplin movies and punished if they laughed.) You can look it up in Lawrence Weschler's harrowing book, A Miracle, a Universe: Settling Accounts With Torturers.) Quite an impressive number of Uruguayans are still looking for members of their families. The Uruguayan oligarchy was probably smart in making few claims for itself while it was doing this. It certainly didn't announce that it was trying to bring about a workers' paradise. The mere boast that it was doing it in order to ward off communism was enough to keep the weapons and "advisers" coming from my home town of Washington DC, and to procure an uncritical silence from most western "intellectuals".</p>
      <p>You scorn the sinister illusion of human perfectibility, as well you may. But - though I don't criticise you for idealising Uruguay as a counter revolutionary tourist - I do earnestly hint to you that there may yet be more scope for radical human improvement. And by the way, and since you linger too long on the subject of mirth, you say that nobody laughed at Hitler. Well, the fellow traveller Charlie Chaplin seems to have contrived it.</p>
      <p>This whole exchange between us comes at an unsettling time for me, because I think that a huge section of the "left" has fatally condemned itself by flirting with, or actually succumbing to, a creepy concept of "moral equivalence" between the United States and its (actually our) enemies - whether Christian Orthodox thugs in the Balkans or Islamic fascists in Afghanistan or national socialists in Mesopotamia. Talk about wincing - I can scarcely bear to read the drivel and bad faith that is now emitted by some of my former comrades. However, and though I am now without allegiances, I still choose to regard the term "comrade" as a title of honour, and one which betrays itself rather than fulfils itself in such negations. It was always a sorrow to me - I can tell you this now - that my dearest friend showed no real interest in such apparent metaphysics, and I'm sorry all over again that you have written on the subject in such a way as to give pleasure to those who don't love you, as I do.</p>

      <p>Life Style</p>
      <p>by Bruce Mau, Phaidon</p>
      <p>Bruce Mau's graphic design doesn't look like his mind, if, that is, his mind looks anything like his book. The Canadian Mau works with incredible clarity and precison (see his identity for the Netherlands Architecture Institute, his design for Zone books), but his book o determinedly non-glossy, neatly dispensing with that idea of graphics o is a less tidy affair. By which we don't mean it's a mess. Rather it's a wide-ranging, fascinating view of the world. It's called Life Style because it offers hundreds of explanations (or observations) of what we see around us o from photoshopped images, to weather</p>
      <p>to Madonna o by way of a kind of manifesto. It quotes a little too liberally from Bataille et al, but this is a man who worked with some great men o Koolhaas, Gehry and so on o so we can forgive him.</p>
      <p>Buy for: A fashionable, clever, credibility-craving twentysomething male. He'll love you for this, whichever of the nine possible cover colours you buy for him. Caroline Roux</p>
      <p>Gardens for the Future by Guy Cooper and Gordon Taylor, Conran Octopus</p>
      <p>Rather pretentiously subtitled iGestures against the wildi, this is nonetheless the best of the flurry of new books on the contemporary garden. Impeccably researched,</p>
      <p>it includes a wide range of outstanding case studies from every corner of the planet. As an added bonus the inclusion of original plans and drawings, and the excellent photography makes this book the perfect present for anyone with even the remotest interest in contemporary design. It is a handsome, highly covetable book, which will look the part on even the most stylish of coffee tables o and just in case you</p>
      <p>want to read it (the madness),</p>

      <p>40 Architects Under 40</p>
      <p>by Jessica Cargill Thompson, Taschen</p>
      <p>A lot of you will know this already, but 40 is far from</p>
      <p>long in the tooth for an architect. In fact, it's practically their teen years. So you'd be right to expect a joyous collection of exciting work in this book, fuelled by the inspiration of youth and unfettered by the cynicism of middle years.</p>
      <p>And much of the work, gathered from all over the world, is pretty entertaining, although o with youth prevailing o often quite derivative, too. Top moments come from the Japanese experimentalist Shigeru Ban and his terrifying wall-less houses, and the uncompromising monuments</p>
      <p>of Jarmund/Vignsnaes o it's amazing what you can get</p>

      <p>The Modern Garden</p>
      <p>by Jane Brown,</p>
      <p>Thames &amp; Hudson</p>
      <p>The onset of the new millennium has had a deep effect in some circles. In garden book land, for example, after years of admiring the same pictures of Sissinghurst taken at various times of the day or year, we now seem to be inundated by a belated influx of books on the icontemporaryi garden. This is good news. Only now we can't help wondering what happened in the long, dark years between Kathryn Gustafson and Vita Sackville-West. We have found the answer, finally, in this comprehensive book charting the development of that little-known by-product of the 20th century o the modern movement garden as started in Europe in the 20s and 30s, developed in the Americas by the likes of Thomas Church, Dan Kiley and Roberto Burle-Marx, and brought back here after 1945, only to disappear 20 years later.</p>
      <p>Buy for: Now that we are almost a whole year into the 21st century you could even buy it for your mother o Kathryn Gustafson might still be too much, but chances are mama is probably sick of Sissinghurst herself. Tommaso del Buono</p>
      <p>Design for Living: Furniture and lighting 1950-2000</p>
      <p>by David Hanks and Anne Hoy, Flammarion</p>
      <p>There comes a time in every Christmas Day when that sneaking thought enters all our heads: bloody hell, I wish I'd got a bloody Joe Colombo table lamp instead of a bloody pewter photo frame. Why not turn it into a savage parlour game, if you're stuck for thrills once Kate and Leo have shuffled off Titanic: ifantasy presentsi (aka ichuck the scented coat hanger in the bin as soon as Aunt Maud's dozed offi). You can use this as a guide, compiling as it does the key design icons of the past 50 years, all held in the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts' enviable collection. They're all there to lust after, from George Nelson to Tom Dixon, in a decently displayed and informative book. And you never know, drop the right (heavy) hints to granny and you might find a Jacobsen Egg chair in your stocking next year (in your dreams, buster).</p>

      <p>Garden Mania</p>
      <p>by Philip de Bay and James Bolton, Thames &amp; Hudson</p>
      <p>Nice to know that once upon a time there was more to gardening than the earthy style practised by Charlie and Alan. Personally, we favour a rather grander, more restful Marie-Antoinette style ourselves o you know, dressing up in fancy clothes and pretending to be a rural aristo for a couple of hours. If you feel this way too, chances are you will love this book. After a rather aimless introduction by Monty Don, this is a colourful, randomly put together romp through the history of gardens, via a haphazard but fascinating collection of period drawings, plans and illustrations. All our favourites are here: temples, follies, improbably clipped hedges, pagodas, bridges and statues.</p>
      <p>Buy for: Should you have any doubt whatsoever that the recipient of this wonderful present might not quite understand or appreciate it, do yourself a favour: you keep it and let them watch Ground Force.</p>

      <p>Airline: identity,</p>
      <p>design and culture</p>
      <p>by Keith Lovegrove,</p>
      <p>Laurence King</p>
      <p>When all around you is turkey remains and snoozing relatives you'll be thankful someone bought you this. Slink away to a quiet corner of the house, settle down and let your mind drift high above the clouds into the forever-glamorous world of air travel. Smiling stewardesses and immaculate in-plane interiors from the 20s to the present day fill the book in a way that'll soon have you making a break for Heathrow. Fashion is the first topic tackled, with such fabulous sights as the iBraniff Babesi, 60s stewardesses dressed in psychedelic Pucci uniforms. The Food section is best skipped over until the Christmas meal has settled, but the Interiors pages are perfect reminders of how to fly in style. In today's culture of power-napping, those great on-board cocktail bars of the 50s are doomed never to return. BA's plans for its new Club Class just don't compare, but at least its brave attempt at jazzing up the livery gets a nod in the Identity section. Sadly, then, the end of the book comes when calls from the kitchen bring you back to down to earth with a bump.</p>
      <p>Buy for: Uncles who remember when you could flirt with the stewardesses, fashionable sisters-in-law or, of course, your good, well-travelled self.</p>

      <p>Garden Colour Palette</p>
      <p>by Paul Williams,</p>
      <p>Conran Octopus</p>
      <p>We never thought gardening could be such fun. This book easily beats paint colour charts and even the Avon catalogue for entertainment. The main difference here is that instead of bearing names such as Rouge Vamp, colour shades o displayed in full blown flower form o have long, unpronounceable Latin names. Its format is brilliant: behind a practical see-through plastic cover, a ring binder and pages split in three independent strips will ensure hours of harmless fun dreaming up dramatic combos for your patch. And there is some practical advice thrown in for good measure too, even though we strongly suspect that something went very wrong in the hardiness ratings attached to every plant.</p>

      <p>The Story of Architecture</p>
      <p>by Jonathan Glancey,</p>
      <p>Dorling Kindersley</p>
      <p>Turning architecture into something for all the family sounds about as unlikely as turning it into fabulously sexy television (see the Stirling Prize). So let's hear it for Jonathan Glancey, whose The Story of Architecture really is family friendly reading.</p>
      <p>This could be a slight case of blowing our own trumpet (JG being The Guardian's architecture critic an' all), but actually it's more a case of credit where due. The book is a fair and accurate history of a very complex subject that's both interesting and unpatronising, rolling along from Mesopotamia to the Japanese Metabolists at a cracking pace. Regulars readers of Glancey, though, might find it worryingly uncritical: even the chapter on postmodernism goes no further than a sad tone of disappointment rather than utter disapproval. No parental guidance necessary, but sadly it doesn't come with an accompanying computer game to sustain some young interest.</p>

      <title>Cult heroes: A Certain Ratio - genre-bending influencers put the funk in punk</title>
      <subtitle>They made their mark on everyone from Talking Heads to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, yet this Manchester group have never had so much as a sniff of a hit</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Pop history is full of hugely influential acts who never received the success or credit they deserved. But it is hard to think of many who have been as influential as A Certain Ratio and remained almost completely unknown to the general public.</p>
      <p>ACR were one of the first artists on Factory Records, were responsible for the label's first single-artist release (the All Night Party single in May 1979) and were pioneers of what became known as "punk funk". Their impact now stretches from Talking Heads to Happy Mondays, from the Rapture to the Invisible to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band are legends in Manchester, but recognition has come more from fellow musicians, Factory obsessives and dancefloor-friendly indie hipsters than from the man in the street.</p>
      <p>Superfan James Murphy would give potential LCD Soundsystem recruits a tape including their frenetic early track Do the Du as an example of the jerkily funky sound he wanted. And DJ Andrew Weatherall was such an ACR nut that for a while in the 1980s he donned the band's trademark "desert rats" style - although he admitted to the Guardian recently that a "Hitler Youth haircut, German army vest and big shorts" meant that while "I thought I looked like I was in A Certain Ratio, actually I looked like Don Estelle in It Ain't Half Hot Mum."</p>
      <p>Like funky Forrest Gumps, ACR seem to have been present at scores of pivotal moments of pop history. According to frontman Jeremy Kerr, when they supported Talking Heads in the late 70s, David Byrne watched them every night, captivated by their collision of punk, industrial and funk, and curious about what they'd been listening to. "He'd never heard of George Clinton, which seems comical now," Kerr told me in 2011. "But they were coming from a punk background. Their next album was funky." To my ears at least, Reni's revolving snare pattern on the second half of the Stone Roses' I Am the Resurrection sounds eerily similar to that on ACR's Winter Hill, released eight years earlier.</p>
      <p>If we'd had a hit, people would have known us. Now, people still ask, 'Who are they? What are they?'</p>
      <p>The band even had an unlikely hand in a major commercial pop phenomenon. When Sire Records' Seymour Stein was interested in signing the young Madonna, she supported ACR in New York so he could watch her perform. Ian Curtis of Joy Division was a fan - ACR's original frontman, Simon Topping, even stood in for him at a turbulent Joy Division gig in Bury - and ACR are immortalised in the film 24 Hour Party People as having the same energy as their illustrious labelmates, "but better clothes". Kerr rescued the slap bass from the tyranny of Level 42.</p>
      <p>Despite their influence, they have never had so much as a sniff of a hit. The closest they have come to widespread popularity was when their 1980 single Shack Up (a cover of an obscure 1975 cut by Banbarra ) became a dancefloor smash in New York clubs. Not that the lack of mainstream success bothers the band. As Kerr told me in 2010: "If we'd had a hit, people would have known us. Now, people still ask, 'Who are they? What are they?'"</p>
      <p>It's a good question, and one reason why their now-rare live appearances are greeted like glimpses of Halley's comet, as fans of their various eras flock to see them (many of us digging out our old shorts and khaki tops, and, yes, probably looking like Don Estelle).</p>
      <p>I've seen the band play live many times across four decades - occasionally copying their 1940s haircuts - and no two gigs have been alike. If there is an ACR sound, it's a blend of urban funk and something more indefinable, existential and melancholy, but they have ricocheted from post-punk to Latin grooves to techno and electro-funk. I've seen them bleak, austere, dark and haunting, sporting their early "Demob chic" look ( Futurama 1979 ), navel-gazing and stupefyingly boring (Leeds Warehouse, 1982), poppier and electronic (Cities in the Park, 1991) and putting on two of the most life-affirming celebrations of dance music I have ever seen (at the Brudenell Social Club, Leeds, in 2009, and the Womad festival in 1985, which is probably my favourite).</p>
      <p>Three of us had hitchhiked - as we often did, surviving lifts such as the one from the psychotic HGV driver whose party trick was to jack-knife his vehicle in front of unsuspecting car drivers, or the spanking headmaster who prompted one of us to make a bolt for it at the traffic lights after mentioning the instruments of torture he kept in the boot.</p>
      <p>Donald Johnson burst into the dressing room singing Cameo's Word Up with a huge red fire extinguisher between his legs</p>
      <p>ACR played on the Saturday evening, unveiling the songs that would appear on 1986's mighty Force album - described by drummer Donald Johnson as "the Mike Tyson of funk". Sweat dripped from the roof as they unveiled their latest new direction - the sound of Miles Davis visiting Hulme - with exuberant fans tooting on hand-held whistles to the Mancunian funk of Mickey Way (the Candy Bar) and Wild Party.</p>
      <p>At times, ACR haven't just soundtracked my life, but have played key parts in it. They helped determine my career by being the first band I interviewed, when I nervously tiptoed backstage at Leeds University to interview them for Past, Past and Future fanzine. Any expectation that they might be sullen, serious, miserable Factory Records stereotypes was dispelled when Johnson burst into the dressing room singing Cameo's Word Up ("All you pretty laydeez around the world ...") with a huge red fire extinguisher between his legs.</p>
      <p>Ah, Donald Johnson. The man who answered ACR's call when they put out a request for "the funkiest drummer in Manchester". The reason (along with Joy Division's Stephen Morris and Echo and the Bunnymen's Pete de Freitas) that I chucked my student grant on a drum kit. The two-legged funk machine; occasional ACR lead singer; the man who can apparently play New Order's rhythmically demanding electro hit Confusion on a drum kit (even New Order play it on a machine).</p>
      <p>The embryonic, pre-Johnson ACR played a weird, brooding, drummerless trance-punk with a disorienting atmosphere. They were post-punk Wire/Throbbing Gristle fans who got their name from a Brian Eno lyric ("I've been looking for a certain ratio"), but listened to Parliament-Funkadelic. Suddenly they were asking a drummer steeped in funk to join.</p>
      <p>"At the first rehearsal, he said: 'What the fuck is this?'" Kerr remembered. "But when he played over it, it sounded great."</p>
      <p>Johnson's entrance prompted a run of killer singles such as Shack Up and the mesmeric Flight, and early classic albums such as The Graveyard and the Ballroom, To Each and Sextet. The old adage about ecstasy - that it "taught white kids to dance" - was also true of Johnson and ACR.</p>
      <p>Along the way, there have been lineup changes, but the core of the band has been rock solid since 1979: bassist/singer Kerr, drumming maestro Johnson and guitarist Martin Moscrop.</p>
      <p>I haven't liked all of their records (although I can't think of any I've actually hated) but I absolutely love most of them, from All Night Party through to their last album, 2008's Mind Made Up, right down to their stunning sleeves. Sadly, much of their best stuff isn't on Spotify, but a newcomer can't go wrong with The Old and the New compilation, or Do the Du, Shack Up, Flight, Wild Party, Blown Away, any of the various versions of Knife Slits Water, futurist jazz funk monster Sounds Like Something Dirty, And Then She Smiles, the cowbell-banging Si Firmir O Grido, Life's a Scream, 27 Forever, and on and on. Once you start listening to Certain Ratio, it's difficult to stop. Now where's that whistle?</p>

      <title>G2: 'I was a teenage fraudster': In the mid 80s, Barry Minkow was the American Dream come true: a self-made teenage millionaire feted on Oprah. But then he was imprisoned for a huge stock market fraud. Today he is a pastor - and special adviser to the FBI in the wake of Enron and WorldCom. He talks to Oliver Burkeman</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Barry Minkow picked up the telephone one late spring morning in 1987 and knew right away that the game was up. Until that point, his life had seemed like a movie plot - the skinny 16-year-old from the LA suburbs who starts his own company in his parents' garage, hoping to impress girls, and ends up a celebrated teenage millionaire, paraded on Oprah, and lecturing in business schools. His carpet-cleaning firm, ZZZZ Best, had started with a loan of Dollars 1,600 (pounds 1,000); within four years it was employing 1,400 people, and by the time Minkow took it public - crowning him the youngest chief executive on Wall Street by a stretch - the company was worth more than Dollars 280m, and busily diversifying into lucrative restoration jobs on fire-damaged hotels and apartment blocks. He was stunning. The mayor of Los Angeles was so stunned that he declared an official Barry Minkow Day across the city.</p>
      <p>So it was only to be expected that envious rivals would want to cause him grief. Perhaps it was even to be expected that he would have a team of fraud investigators on the phone, like he did now, demanding a guided tour of an upmarket apartment building that ZZZZ Best had renovated in Dallas. But there was something about the building in question which certainly wasn't to be expected, which was that it didn't exist.</p>
      <p>Not existing, as it turned out, was a recurring problem with the diverse activities of the Minkow empire. In June 1987, two days before it was due to acquire a competitor twice its size for Dollars 40m, ZZZZ Best collapsed - and Minkow, then 20, stood exposed as the perpetrator of a massive stock fraud which the court would later value at Dollars 26m - probably an underestimate. For years he had been frenziedly negotiating slabs of investment worth millions of dollars for bogus projects he never planned to fund - he just needed the cash to pay for his staff, not to mention his Ferrari Testarossa and his mansion in the wealthy community of Woodland Hills.</p>
      <p>Minkow ended up serving seven and a half years in prison, still something of a record for a white-collar crime. "Real prison, too," he points out, "most of that time with a murderer for a cellmate, not 18 months in a golf-course camp."</p>
      <p>And so he has been watching with a certain wry detachment in recent weeks as the behemoths of the US economy - WorldCom, Enron, Arthur Andersen, Global Crossing; now Xerox; now Merck - have become mired in charges of fraud. This is partly because his mind is on higher things these days: for five and a half years he has been the senior pastor of the Community Bible Church in Mira Mesa, California, having found God in jail. (And he knows what you're thinking, by the way. "I'm not allowed to sign cheques and my name isn't on the bank accounts," he says. "I don't want to be in that position.")</p>
      <p>Mainly, though, it's because he thinks he knows what was going through the minds of Kenneth Lay, Bernie Ebbers and their ilk. The FBI thinks so, too, and has hired him to give seminars to its investigators. Minkow also performs "fraudits" on behalf of the Fraud Discovery Institute, which he co-founded. .</p>
      <p>"Everyone I met in prison had one thing in common - they never planned on being there," he says, talking loud and fast and expansively, still with a salesman's charm, using my name at every possible opportunity. "And not one of those companies went into business to defraud. Not one. Neither did I. What people don't realise is that fraud is always a means to an end, never an end in itself. There is always a rationalisation: I'm going to do this now, and it's tough, but next week we're gonna get some big carpet-cleaning jobs, whatever, and we're gonna make it back, pay everyone back, nobody's gonna be hurt - and that will be the cure."</p>
      <p>ZZZZ Best started out real enough. Minkow wanted desperately to be popular at school, to find a girlfriend; his twin strategy involved taking steroids to boost his muscles and starting his own business. He chose the logical line of work: his mother had a job cold-calling for a carpet-cleaning firm, and he had an after-school job actually cleaning them. Once he had his own equipment - bought with a loan from a friend - he hired his mother to work the phones, basing the fledgling enterprise in the family garage in the downmarket suburb of Roseda. Within months, he had more employees and made it on to the local television news, slacking on his schoolwork in his quest to become the carpet-cleaning king of California.</p>
      <p>The publicity began to snowball. People magazine caught on, and Oprah, and Newsweek, and the business magazines - and Tom Bradley, the LA mayor, with his plan for a civic celebration of youthful brilliance that caught even Minkow by surprise. "Celebrity was a tool to attract money," he says. "It isn't like the mayor sent in a team of accountants to audit my books before he declared Barry Minkow Day - but the impression investors got was that he did. When I did Oprah, the impression was given that they'd checked me out, but, of course, they hadn't.</p>
      <p>"That's how it works: the bank gives the loan because the numbers were done by Arthur Andersen. Arthur Andersen took on the job because the law firm was one of the Big Ten, and they'd surely have caught on if anything was wrong . . . And on it goes."</p>
      <p>Everything happened very fast indeed after that. Minkow retained Wall Street lawyers and reputable accountants, using credibility to attract investment and investments to buy credibility. He planned a public stock offering, and ZZZZ Best expanded into "insurance restoration" - renovating buildings damaged by smoke and fire - while Minkow spun tales of 40% profit margins, winning another Dollars 15m investment.</p>
      <p>The company finally went public in a blaze of media coverage in 1986, catapulted into a stockmarket as dizzy as one that would follow a decade and a half later on the back of the internet boom. Within weeks, shares in ZZZZ Best soared from an initial offering of Dollars 4 to Dollars 18. Nobody was in the mood for asking questions - which was unfortunate, because Minkow might have had difficulty answering them.</p>
      <p>Ever since the company's earliest days, in fact, he had been stealing to boost growth and make ends meet. It began, as he explains it, with "money orders stolen from the money order place at Rick's Liquor Store in Resada", but it quickly escalated.</p>
      <p>"There are two days in my life I remember especially," he says. "One is when I first started taking steroids, aged 15. I was in the bathroom, and I remember closing the door and thinking the pill was so small, how could it do the things they said? I took it and I knew I had crossed the line: I wanted to be strong now, who cares if you can't have kids when you're 30? Live for the now. Very existential. Jean-Paul Sartre. Camus.</p>
      <p>"And then there was the day I decided: I want to be successful this year. This quarter. Not later. That's when I rationalised. I'd have some big carpet-cleaning jobs coming up, and it would all work out."</p>
      <p>For a long time it did: Minkow had quickly moved on from Rick's Liquor Store to obtaining bank loans on spurious grounds; by the time ZZZZ Best had moved into insurance restoration, he had been operating a massive, precarious pyramid scheme, taking in millions and paying off his early investors with money from later ones. It looked like a house of cards, but Minkow had a cure: the public offering had been part of the plan, a surge of income that would allow him to pay off his investors, and then, as a player on Wall Street, build a legitimate business.</p>
      <p>As in the recent corporate scandals, it was not the accountants and the auditors who toppled Minkow's pyramid, although in his case they seem more criminally gullible than conspiring. There were thousands of documents to prove that ZZZZ Best's business was legitimate - they were all faked, of course - but when a team of accountants, undertaking routine due diligence, finally asked to see a restoration project in action, Minkow fooled them with an act that this time made his life truly seem like Hollywood. At the last minute, he rented a half-finished building in San Diego, stationed ZZZZ Best staff to stand around with rolls of carpet nearby, and presented it to the accountants as a typical example of the company in action.</p>
      <p>They scared him three months later by asking to see the finished project. He pulled it off again this time by re-renting the still unfinished building and, astonishingly, renovating it from scratch in 20 days. "Just like Enron's fake trading floor," he points out.</p>
      <p>Going public had not quite proved the panacea he had hoped, but by now he was within 48 hours of another cure: the acquisition of KeyServe, a rival firm, using a Dollars 40m outside investment masterminded by the junk-bond king Michael Milken.</p>
      <p>But then there was the Mafia. Minkow had bumped into a Mafioso on a carpet-cleaning job months previously, and by this point one of his biggest institutional investors was the Genovese crime family of New York. It was investigators chasing the Mob who finally caught up with the chief executive of ZZZZ Best. Then a newspaper excavated an old tale of credit-card fraud - one of Minkow's earlier fundraising plans - and then he got the phone call asking him to demonstrate that he really had undertaken a renovation in Dallas. This time the investigators were on the lookout for fraud, and Minkow, exhausted, did not try to fool them.</p>
      <p>'Things go from order to disorder," Minkow explains today, slipping into seminar mode. "This is one of the laws of what I call fraudodynamics. Let's say Nick Leeson got the one good trading day he needed to cure the fraud. Well, he's reinforced subconsciously the idea that he can do it - faced with pressure, he'll do it again. Do you think Nick Leeson's first trade was a billion? Of course not. And if I could have survived, I would have been able to sell my restricted stock, unload a million shares, get close to Dollars 20m in cash, pay off the Ponzi scheme and go forward."</p>
      <p>These days he visits executives while wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, telling them: "Look. I know you think you can be one good trading day away. But if you lie, you're going to be wearing this jumpsuit for eight Super Bowls."</p>
      <p>There is one further lesson from the ZZZZ Best story that Kenneth Lay and Bernie Ebbers might like to consider: you can say sorry, even pay back the people you robbed, and the sky, surprisingly enough, does not fall in. Minkow has been paying back his victims - mostly institutional investors - at a rate of around 95 cents to the dollar ever since he got out of jail, first under the terms of his probation and now, he says, because his religion requires him to. One major creditor has received Dollars 100,000 so far; Minkow says he pays between Dollars 750 and Dollars 2,000 a month into restitution funds. At a recent hearing connected to his probation, the judge who first sentenced him praised the fact that he was "on a straight and narrow path" and thanked him for his annual Christmas card.</p>
      <p>"I do some prison visiting, and everybody there tells me: you're an idiot, you're a moron, you served the time, so why pay and get hit twice?" Minkow says. "But God would have you pay back the money even if you did the time. Unfortunately. That's what I hate about my faith. I had to get this faith where there's no way out. I'd love to tell them to take a flying leap." He sighs. "But I can't."</p>

      <title>Raiders of the lost faith: The Cathar religion was suppressed 750 years ago. But, says Stephen O'Shea in his new book, it has inspired ever-wilder new cults, treasure-seekers, fascists and new age fantasists across the world</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The Cathar heretics of Languedoc in France, and their terrible fate, have fascinated people for centuries. The Cathars were dissident, pacifist Christians who believed that an evil deity had created the material world and a good god all the invisible rest.</p>
      <p>As if to prove Cathar beliefs, the armed might of Rome and Paris exterminated them with such glee that the name given to the Cathars' torment - the Albigensian crusade - still evokes a shiver. In the mid-12th century, the Cathar Perfect, who were hard-working preachers leading lives of poverty, won a threateningly large following in Languedoc, which was then an independent region of traders impatient with the strictures of the Church. Popes vainly pleaded with the nobles of Languedoc to extirpate the heresy, and St Dominic set out on a preaching tour in the 13th century, but it fell on deaf ears.</p>
      <p>Only when a hated papal legate, Peter of Castelnau, was felled by assassins in the region did the most powerful of medieval popes, Innocent III, find a pretext to enrol northern Europe in a campaign of terror in Languedoc. The crusade began at Beziers in 1209, when 20,000 people were slaughtered ("Kill them all, God will know his own!" was the order) and lasted 20 bloody years. The greatest Cathar figures - Raymond Roger Trencavel of Carcassonne, Esclarmonde of Foix and Raymond VI of Toulouse - were either killed, or forced into hiding or surrender.</p>
      <p>The crusade was followed by the birth of the Inquisition, expressly formed to hunt down and burn the remaining Cathars. As inquisitors fanned out over the countryside of Albi, Toulouse and Carcassonne, anyone resisting them was imprisoned, tortured or killed. On March 16, 1244, some 200 Cathars who had withstood a 10-month siege atop their summit hideout of Montsegur were marched into a field and burned alive. Although the faith survived fitfully for a few generations, Montsegur marked the end of all hope for Catharism.</p>
      <p>In the 19th century, the subject drew writers - many of them cranks - attracted to the story of the faith's demise. Foremost was Napoleon Peyrat, an anticlerical bourgeois liberal and talented fabulist, who concocted in the 1870s an account of the Cathars, which, though largely made up, still passes as truth in esoteric circles.</p>
      <p>His Cathars were heroic, the forefathers of progress in the darkness of Catholic totalitarianism. His heretics hoarded an immense treasure - spiritual and material - at Montsegur, and managed, before their incineration, to hide it in the foothills of the Pyrenees. And Esclarmonde of Foix, a high-born Cathar Perfect who may have debated with St Dominic, was transformed, in Peyrat's narrative, into an Occitan Joan of Arc, a virginal high priestess.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Peyrat, the faith of the Cathars, further bowdlerised by enthusiasts, went on to enliven turn-of-the-century seances, jazz age Orientalist fantasies, Nazi musings, Languedoc separatist diatribes, hippie literature, treasure-hunter tall tales and other alternative writings. "Esclarmonde of Foix" began showing up in Paris as a disembodied voice at seances frequented by intellectuals and socialites disgusted, at least for an evening, by 19th-century materialism. The Cathar Perfect were ideal interlocutors for such groups.</p>
      <p>Fin-de-siecle France also saw an explosion of theosophy - a rediscovery of the religions of the east. Among the occult salons and secret societies, Peyrat's Cathars prospered. They went from being proto-liberals to inheritors of a line of eastern wisdom. A neo-Gnostic Church was founded by a man who declared himself the gnostic patriarch of Paris - and, significantly, of Montsegur.</p>
      <p>Peyrat's treasure of Montsegur became a cache of ancient knowledge in a theory advanced by an influential occultist, Josephin Peladan. His friends - Charles Baudelaire, Joris-Karl Huysmans and others - called him Sar, as befitted his self-proclaimed status as descendant of the monarchs of ancient Assyria. Peladan-Sar pointed out that Montsalvat, the holy mountain of Wagner's Parsifal and Lohengrin, had to be Montsegur. This led to the myth of the Pyrenean Holy Grail, the elusive secret behind western civilisation hidden in the mountains between France and Spain.</p>
      <p>After the calamity of the first world war, which led to a continent-wide interest in the paranormal, the call of the Cathars was heard beyond France. British spiritualists descended on Montsegur, where occultists were busily embroidering Peyrat's narrative, among them Deodat Roche, a notary from a town near Carcassonne. Roche was a disciple of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy, which promised its followers direct immediate contact with the spirit world. Roche's Cathar-tainted anthroposophy was open to all influences - Hinduism, druidism, gnosis.</p>
      <p>He made much of cave scratchings near Montsegur, claiming they were pentagrams traced by Cathar fugitives to transmit a message to posterity. Any cave graffito not obviously modern was immediately Catharized by Roche (who died in 1978, at the age of 101).</p>
      <p>Around him was a group of young spiritual seekers, including, for a time, the philosopher Simone Weil. She used an anagrammatic pen-name, Emile Novis, for her articles about medieval Languedoc as a moral utopia. But one of the best distorters and exporters of the legacy of Peyrat was Maurice Magre, a writer of con siderable talent now almost forgotten. In the 20s and 30s, this prolific novelist and essayist (and prodigious consumer of opium) brought the energy of Montparnasse to Catharism. He wrote two Cathar novels, The Blood Of Toulouse and The Treasure Of The Albigensians. In the first he recast the fabulations of Peyrat and caricatured the enemies of the Cathars: the wife of the crusade leader, Simon de Montfort, is described as having rotting teeth, skin the colour of Sicilian lemons, and a big nose. His second, less successful novel presented the Perfect as Buddhists.</p>
      <p>In 1930 Magre met a young German graduate student in Paris, Otto Rahn. Magre directed Rahn to his friends in the Pyrenees, and the result, in 1933, was a book, Crusade Against The Grail. Rahn assembled all the Pyrenean Grail stories and compared them to the medieval Parzifal, by Wolfram von Eschenbach. Montsalvat became Montsegur, Parsifal (or Perceval) became Trencavel, and the guardian of the Grail was the feminised Esclarmonde of Foix.</p>
      <p>She was guarding a sacred stone, dropped when the angels had fallen from heaven, and hid it in the mountain before the storming of Montsegur. This was the true Grail, mistakenly placed (in the 14th-century cycle written by Chretien de Troyes) in the north of France and wrongly appropriated by Christian mythology.</p>
      <p>Rahn's Cathars were pagans; they were also - and this was new - troubadours. His book successfully placed the Cathars at the centre of esoteric Grail studies. Rahn then cast the darkest shadow ever across Cathar country; in 1937, he published The Court Of Lucifer, another Grail book. By this time, he had moved back to Germany and joined the SS.</p>
      <p>Who were the Cathars, in Rahn's view? "We do not need the god of Rome, we have our own. We do not need the commandments of Moses, we carry in our hearts the legacy of our ancestors. It is Moses who is imperfect and impure . . . We, Westerners of nordic blood, we call ourselves Cathars just as Easterners of nordic blood are called Parsees, the Pure. Our heaven is open only to those who are not creatures of an inferior race, or bastards, or slaves. It is open to Aryas. Their name means that they are nobles and lords."</p>
      <p>Rahn's benign Grail speculations and his later Hitlerian take combined. After the second world war, well into the 1970s, a cottage industry of former Vichy collaborators produced innumerable rumours connecting the Nazis to the Cathars. One held that on March 16 1944, the 700th anniversary of Montsegur, Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi theorist, overflew the peak in homage.</p>
      <p>Hitler and his closest advisors were said to have been part of a neo-Cathar pagan secret society. German engineers were said to have excavated Montsegur during the Occupation and come away with the Holy Grail. In this last tale (suggesting the films Raiders Of The Lost Ark and its sequel Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade), Esclarmonde's Cathar stone - or, according to extreme right-wingers, a non-Jewish tablet of commandments - was buried in a glacier in the Bavarian Alps just before the fall of Germany. These rumours had stubborn staying power. In 1978 there was a minor diplomatic incident when rowdy German boy scouts were accused by locals of trying to steal blocks of stone from Montsegur. The alleged prank was taken as proof that the boys had neo-Nazi leanings.</p>
      <p>The legacy of Peyrat did not degenerate wholly into nostalgia for the Third Reich. In fact, Rahn's competition overwhelmed him. There was an obvious comparison to be made between Cathars and members of the French Resistance, fighting an invading force. This came up again and again in works published in the 50s. The Cathars - bourgeois liberals, Buddhists, gnostics, Nazis etc - had now joined the maquis.</p>
      <p>The propaganda of Roche and Magre also led to a serious archeological search of Montsegur for signs of hidden chambers and tunnels. Nothing was found. This did not stop Fernand Niel from publishing a study showing Montsegur to have been constructed as a solar temple, and including one of his diagrams in a volume he wrote about the Cathars for a French collection of handbooks destined for schools and reference libraries.</p>
      <p>His explanation of the solar nuances of Cathar construction has since been vitiated by the scientific conclusion that the ruined castle atop Montsegur was built long after the Cathar crusade. (The original castle was demolished in the 13th or 14th century, then replaced). The same conclusion about other ruined castles in the Corbieres and the Pyrenees has not prevented them becoming "Cathar castles" - evocative remnants visited by eco-hikers convinced that they are looking at solar temples destroyed by Catholicism.</p>
      <p>The 60s updated the lore surrounding Cathars to suit the counter-culture. The babas-cool , French back-to-the-land hippies, made the Pyrenees a prime target for returning to nature and making goat's cheese. When they began arriving in the late 60s, they were met by Dutch Rosicrucians, neo-gnostics from Belgium and other groups who had already moved to Cathar country summer camps. The babas-cool found the idea of the Cathars appealing: they were vegetarians; they were said to disapprove of marriage - therefore they were pro-free love; women could be Perfect - therefore the Cathars were feminists; and they partook of the troubadour love culture of Occita nia. Rock groups serenaded crowds at the foot of Montsegur, where the billows of smoke came now only from reefers.</p>
      <p>British psychiatrist Arthur Guirdham gained notoriety in the 70s through occult books that inspired many Britons to explore south-western France. He described several of his patients who independently exhibited signs of being reincarnated Cathar Perfect. He, himself, is/was Guilhabert de Castres, the greatest of the heretical holy men. Why so many of these Cathar spirits congregated in Bath, the home of Guirdham's practice, is not answered, but his new age updating of Parisian salon seances has proved enduring.</p>
      <p>By the late 70s, people measured the cosmic vibrations at Cathar castles. Occitan nationalists gathered for ceremonies at Montsegur. Weekend archeologists turned up what they always claimed were Cathar crosses, pendants and stone doves. Replicas of these became the staples at craft fairs through Languedoc. Stonehengers and other neo-pagans took an interest. French television did specials on the enigmas of the Cathar story, all more or less inherited from the work of Roche in the 30s.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Roche's death, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln published the most successful book ever about Cathar country: The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail, now past its 35th printing in English. The trio made Catharism a mass phenomenon and turned the international Glastonbury Arthurian followers on to a new medieval romance. The writers took the legacy of Magre, Roche and others and wrote a thoroughly entertaining occult detective story, marketed, however, as non-fiction.</p>
      <p>The mystery goes like this: at the turn of the 20th century, Berenger Sauniere, a country priest in the remote parish of Rennes-le-Chateau, near Carcassonne, suddenly took to living very well and constructing additions to his church and residence, spending millions of francs. Where did he get them? The short and true answer is that he master-minded a system of mail-order fund-raising and conned local notables into leaving him money in their wills. The long answer is in the 500-plus pages of The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail wherein the priest found the treasure that the Cathars smuggled out of Montsegur during the siege. He sold off parts of it, and blackmailed the Vatican.</p>
      <p>In the book, the Cathar treasure, besides containing an incalculable hoard of Visigothic gold, contained proof that Jesus was not God, but a king who had married Mary Magdalene. Their son founded the line of Merovingian kings, who were, incidentally, Jewish. This secret, along with others debunking the divinity of Jesus, had been found below the Temple of Jerusalem during the Crusades. It had been transmitted to both the Cathars and Knights Templar.</p>
      <p>The story continues that, after the treasure's narrow escape at Montsegur, an occult society had kept the secret to themselves until the priestly discovery at Rennes-le-Chateau. In the past, the secret society was supposed to have been headed by, among others, Leonardo da Vinci, Nicolas Poussin, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo and Claude Debussy. There are hints that not all of the treasure has been found. Since the book's publication, the land around Rennes-le-Chateau has become pockmarked with the spadework of treasure-hunters. A landing pad for UFOs has been constructed and tours are now conducted through what is a very ordinary country church.</p>
      <p>The imaginary landscape first outlined by Napoleon Peyrat has become progressively weirder. The Cathars are now a protean bunch, ready to transform into just about anything that a questing soul could desire. Religious cults of the 80s and 90s used them in lethal delirium: the Order of the Solar Temple - the Franco-Quebecois-Swiss suicide cult - based some of its arcane calculations on the nonsense written about the Cathar castles.</p>
      <p>The website of Marshall Applewhite's Heaven's Gate cult teemed with references to the asceticism of the Cathars and "the god hidden behind the god". He eventually persuaded his followers to commit suicide, in order to go to the "level beyond human" - a state similar to that attributed to the Cathar Perfects - and have their souls ascend and speed away in the wake of the real, celestial Hale-Bopp Comet.</p>
      <p>The Cathar industry continues to expand: wineries, websites, restaurants, estate agents, tinned duck packagers, and many other businesses in modern Languedoc have appropriated the label Cathar. There is also a movie in preparation, a French film, The Hand of God, directed by Yves Lombard, to be released this or next year. The film will deal with the great unsolved mystery of the Cathar drama: who killed Peter of Castelnau?</p>
      <p>The Cathars are also likely to have a bright future on the internet, a matter-free medium perfect to serve as an echo chamber of esoteric thought. (At least 5,500 websites have already co-opted the Cathar name, if not the original beliefs.) The medieval heresy, which the Catholic church thought it had so successfully quelled, has, thanks to fabulists, cranks, wishful thinkers and romantics, proved remarkably enduring.</p>

      <title>New Zealand 47-9 Tonga: Rugby World Cup 2015 - as it happened</title>
      <subtitle>The All Blacks overcame a nervy first half to beat Tonga 47-9, bagging seven tries in the process including a score for Ma'a Nonu on his 100th cap for New Zealand</subtitle>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <p>What a difference a half makes. 40 minutes ago, New Zealand were six inches from going into the break just 14-10 up, and they had their captain for this evening, Kieran Read, in the sin bin.</p>
      <p>But the All Blacks were simply sensational in the second half. Ben Smith and Nehe Milner-Skudder were the stand-out players, but Sam Cane also played very well at flanker. New Zealand can now put their feet up and watch France v Ireland on Sunday - they will face the loser of that contest in the quarter-final.</p>
      <p>Now confirmed as the runner-up in Pool C, Argentina will face the winner of that clash. Tonga are out, but that is more down to their crucial defeat to Georgia a few weeks ago than their performance here tonight, which fluctuated from the sublime to the frazzled. They finish in fourth behind the Georgians, who automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Nonu got his try, and organised the All Blacks midfield defence stoutly. He certainly had a night to remember and was carried off the field at St James Park on the shoulders on his team-mates: a nice touch, that.</p>
      <p>Tonga's players give their supporters a cheer on a lap of honour around the pitch. Tonight at least, they've got a lot to be proud of.</p>
      <p>That's all from me, thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!</p>

      <p>80 min: Tonga have the ball as they push for that all-elusive try. It's not happening.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.53pm BST</p>
      <p>79 min: Milner-Skudder gets the man-of-the-match award - he's been excellent especially in this second half, but it could just have easily gone to Ben Smith, who has been at the heart of everything for the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.52pm BST</p>
      <p>Try! (Nonu 77) New Zealand 47-9 Tonga</p>
      <p>He's got his try! A loose Tongan kick again isn't chased up and New Zealand have acres of space to counter attack once they move it left. Milner-Skudder has the freedom of St James' Park but draws Fosita nicely and released Nonu on the wing, who canters into the corner for his landmark score. Carter is the first to congratulate his old mucker, everyone is obviously delighted for the dreadlocked centre. Carter misses the conversion, his first mistake of the night with the boot.</p>

      <p>76 min: STREAKER ON THE PITCH! It is Friday night in Newcastle, after all.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.47pm BST</p>
      <p>74 min: Tonga aren't done yet. They win a penalty and go for the corner. But they can't secure the ball, and New Zealand clear. Nonu showed all his experience, rush defence there. Not the most memorable match for Nonu on his 100th cap, but he's gone about his business efficiently.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.45pm BST</p>
      <p>Conversion! New Zealand 42-9 Tonga</p>
      <p>Ah, that's why Hansen didn't bring Carter off. The No10 knocks it over 10 metres from the touchline.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.44pm BST</p>
      <p>Try! (Cane 71) New Zealand 40-9 Tonga</p>
      <p>Predictably, New Zealand make Tonga pay. It's a simple set-piece but Latu can no nothing to stop Cane from five yards out.</p>

      <p>69 min: Tonga's frustration finally shows: Taumalolo, the replacement hooker, dump tackles Carter to the turf, leaving him in a heap. That is a horribly dangerous tackle, he completely upended the All Black No10, who has taken a battering all night. Yellow card for Taumalolo, fully deserved. When will Steve Hansen hook Carter? Give the guy a break!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.38pm BST</p>
      <p>67 min: More substitutions for the All Blacks: Liam Messam and Keven Mealamu on for Sam Whitelock and Dane Coles.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.37pm BST</p>
      <p>Try! (Sonny Bill Williams 65) New Zealand 35-9 Tonga</p>
      <p>Aaron Smith shows his class, looking left and passing right as Sonny Bill Williams walks through a Pacific-sized gap to score under the posts with his first touch. Carter does his thing. Suddenly this score looks respectable from the All Blacks point of view. They are smiling now! Something I don't think I saw in the first half.</p>

      <p>He's scored again! I said he might not be the quickest wing New Zealand have ever had, but he sure showed some wheels there, latching onto a clever grubber kick from Beauden Barrett.

      <p>57 min: Straight from the kick-off, Ben Smith retrieves the ball. New Zealand are on the offensive again. Tonga are looking a little ragged.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.25pm BST</p>
      <p>55 min: Milner-Skudder isn't the biggest, the quickest, the most dynamic wing New Zealand have ever had but he's got a frightening step and his footballing skills are up there with the best - he has also caught the high ball well and is always looking for the off-load. This is only his fifth All Black cap, but it's also his fifth try.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.23pm BST</p>
      <p>Try! (Milner-Skudder 52) New Zealand 21-6 Tonga</p>
      <p>From the line-out, New Zealand go back to basics. Keeping the ball in the forwards, they brutally march through the Tongan 22. There are maybe 15-16 phases as the Tongans never get anywhere near a turnover, such is the ferocity of Cane's clearouts. Aaron Smith eventually spins it right to Milner-Skudder who dodges Naholo and gets over for the try. Carter converts for a 15-point lead.</p>

      <p>50 min: Tonga are penalised for taking the man without the ball, and New Zealand kick for the corner. They don't need the bonus point of course, but that's what they're gunning for.</p>

      <p>47 min: This is hugely impressive stuff! Tonga's offloads are sensational, they are teaching the All Blacks a thing or two at the moment! Tonga are just 10 metres out, and spin it wide, but ahhhh, it's lost forward. But the referee was playing advantage, Tonga will have a kick at goal for their sterling efforts.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.14pm BST</p>
      <p>46 min: Again, Tonga look most dangerous around the fringes, picking and going with ball in hand. Vainikolo, who recently left Exeter for Oyonnax, then Latu, then Tonga'uiha all make ground. They're into the New Zealand 22 again!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.11pm BST</p>
      <p>44 min: The referee calls time off after Taione takes a blow to the head. But the hooker is back on his feet, he'll be OK to continue.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.09pm BST</p>
      <p>43 min: Just to remind you, Read has about two more minutes in the sin bin until he is allowed to come on again. Try-scorer Tony Woodcock has picked up a knock, he will be substituted for Wyatt Crockett. That will worry Steve Hansen, the last thing he needs is unnecessary injuries.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.10pm BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.08pm BST</p>
      <p>42 min: Ben Smith has probably been the pick of the All Black players and he makes another darting run through the heart of the Tongan defence after a cute pass from Aaron Smith. Lilo eventually brings him down and Tonga scramble a defence, eventually Ben Smith is penalised for not releasing.</p>

      <p>40 min+2 min: Eventually Tonga get it out and they pile it all their bodies with the ball just inches from the line. New Zealand are defending desperately as one Tongan body - is that Latu? - dives over. Did he get it down? It's impossible to tell and the TMO is none the wiser when he is asked for a decision. No try, and the referee calls for half-time. Boos rain down from the stands, the Tongans deserved something there.</p>

      <p>block-time published-time 8.45pm BST</p>
      <p>37 min: The penalty is probably within range of the posts, but Tonga kick for the corner! Great ambition from the islanders. They win their line-out and embark on an almightly driving maul, which the All Blacks have no answers for. New Zealand are driven all the way back to their own try line! Kieran Read collapses the maul, and promptly receives a yellow card. Deserved, that was cynical, off to the sin bin he goes. Penalty for Tonga under the posts.</p>

      <p>35 min: Oh that's a shame! Tonga spin it wide but just as the ball reaches Veainu, who is one on one with Ben Smith, the ball is passed forward. The whistle goes, and Smith upends the Tongan winger anyway. It looks like the referee is going to penalise Smith for a dangerous tackle! Penalty to Tonga.</p>

      <p>Tonga simply can't live with New Zealand when the Kiwis step it up a gear or two. Again, it's not a complicated score: Naholo comes off his wing to break a couple of tackles, Cane and Kaino clear out at the breakdown superbly and Aaron Smith uses the quick ball well, popping the ball right to Woodcock who crashes over from three yards out. There's no stopping him at that range.</p>

      <p>29 min: Two expert offloads, first from Milner-Skudder and then from Carter, mean that the All Blacks again break into Tonga's 22. New Zealand spin it wide and Coles - that is NEW ZEALAND HOOKER DANE COLES - chips a kick out to Naholo. Tonga scramble their defence but they're living on the edge here.</p>

      <p>The odds are certainly stacked against Tonga but the Pacific islanders are certainly capable of a shock. Remember 2011 anyone?</p>
      <p>In their last group game four years ago, Tonga beat France - which probably was the greatest ever World Cup upset ... until Japan did their thing against South Africa last month.</p>

      <p>There is plenty to play for in Pool C. Despite winning all their matches so far, New Zealand are still not yet assured of top spot going into their final game tonight, although only a bonus-pointless defeat to Tonga and a bonus-point victory for Argentina over Namibia on Sunday would mean the Pumas pip the All Blacks. Which isn't really going to happen is it?</p>
      <p>Tonga's task is simple: beat the All Blacks to finish third (ahead of Georgia) in the pool and automatically qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Simple to understand, anyway.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.18am BST</p>
      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>It may or may not surprise you that Tonga's biggest ever defeat came against the All Blacks, a 102-0 trouncing back in 2000. And so when the two nations met in the 2003 World Cup, somebody in the Tongan camp decided it would be a good idea to try and different tact. Something to disrupt New Zealand's rhythm. Something to throw them off. And so, on that day, Tonga interrupted the All Blacks' haka with their own Sipi Tau, resulting in an electrifying stand-off.</p>
      <p>The match finished 91-7 to New Zealand, which Tonga could count as an improvement. One of the nine try-scorers that day was 21-year-old Dan Carter, just was just four months into his All Black career, as was a certain Ma'a Nonu. The centre, with his long locks and imposing frame, is the kind of player that seems like he has played for New Zealand for all-eternity - and how All Black fans wish that was the case - but tonight is his 100th cap. Bravo Ma'a.</p>
      <p>For tonight's match, All Blacks coach Steve Hansen has made six changes, the biggest absence of course being Richie McCaw, who suffered a thigh injury against Georgia last week. He has trained this week and will be available for the knock-outs, but Steve Hansen has decided to rest his captain for this bone-crunching finale in Pool C. Probably for the best, that. Kieran Read skippers the side tonight.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Tonga coach Mana Otai has made one change to his team following their 45-16 defeat to Argentina with inside centre Latiume Fosita coming in for Sione Piukala.</p>
      <p>It's the All Blacks! We're going to see both the haka and the Sipi Tau, possibly at the same time (although Tonga will probably think twice about that). It's the freaking weekend baby, I'm about to have me some fun.</p>

      <title>Go West: Special report on public services in the south-west: Healthcare: Radical redesign: While the south-wests primary care trusts are suffering from inherited debts and managerial pressures, Patrick Butler discovers they can still make a huge change to how the regions healthcare system is developed</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Money - or lack of it - continues to dominate the development of primary care trusts (PCTs) in the south-west. The disturbing decline in Avon's health economy, after it emerged last month that the North Bristol NHS trust had run up an astonishing pounds 44m debt in 2002/03 and was on course for a pounds 38m overspend this year, will have tough ramifications for its local PCTs.</p>
      <p>For those PCTs, still finding their organisational feet, the prospect of yet more belt-tightening at a time when the NHS nationally is enjoying record investment, and when many of them have been battling to clear their own inherited debts, is deeply frustrating.</p>
      <p>But the financial cloud may have a silver lining. The disaster presents a huge, and positive, opportunity for the city's PCTs to be at the centre of plans to radically redesign the way healthcare is delivered.</p>
      <p>The sheer scale of the debts means that the pressure to shift services from hospital into the community - so often mooted since the creation of PCTs to deliver more localised, patient-focused primary healthcare - will be difficult to ignore.</p>
      <p>"The finance issue is a worry. We are still not sure of the impact," says Chris Born, chief executive of North Bristol PCT. "But it is an opportunity to move fast on reconfiguring and redeveloping the service. It is a chance to think about what we want in north Bristol, which is a smaller number of hi-tech hospitals and a lot more community services to replace them."</p>
      <p>The public, who have traditionally been wary of changes which move services out of the expensive acute sector - especially where this involves hospital closures - will need to be convinced that community-based teams in areas such as children's services, stroke treatment, and hospital-at-home care for elderly patients represents a way forward.</p>
      <p>But there is a recognition across the region that the opportunity must be grasped. "PCTs must not lose their big vision of moving services into the community. We must use the Bristol 'maelstrom' to press for change, rather than simply sit back and say 'it's all too difficult'," says Jo Whitehead, chief executive of South Gloucestershire PCT.</p>
      <p>Pushing through major change will test the nascent PCT's managerial skills to the full. PCTs nationally are notoriously lacking in management capacity. South Gloucestershire was one of the first PCTs to be inspected by the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), and its report, published last month identified this as a problem.</p>
      <p>"Staff at all levels have a heavy workload," the report says. "The PCT needs to review the staff capacity required to develop its commissioning role so that it can effectively tackle the financial deficits, deliver national priorities and improve the quality of care delivered to patients."</p>
      <p>The PCT has responded by agreeing to appoint a director of commissioning and capacity - an appointment shared with two neighbouring trusts. But until recently it had struggled to appoint a clinical governance manager. The CHI report also advises that it needs to expand its human resources management capacity and put more resources into workforce planning.</p>
      <p>Despite inherited deficits of around pounds 4.6m, and pressure to deliver national targets, South Gloucestershire was praised for its "loyal and committed" workforce, its "strong leadership" and "an open and honest culture".</p>
      <p>Areas for improvement include the renovation of some of its 30 GP practice premises and closer working with optometrists. Communications with the public needs to be developed, says the report, "to ensure that a dialogue can be continued when consulting on. . . difficult issues such as the Bristol health services plan."</p>
      <p>"The picture that CHI paints was one that we recognised, one that we felt was reasonable and fair," says Whitehead. "It confirmed our general sense of direction rather than giving us any big shocks."</p>
      <p>Alongside the signs of progress, however, is evidence that the pressures of reducing inherited debt and meeting government targets have put a brake on rapid change. In Wiltshire, plans to create a care trust in April 2004 by merging three PCTs with Wiltshire social care services have been put on hold.</p>
      <p>According to Ray Jones, director of adult and community services at Wiltshire County Council, a combination of the social services department losing a star in last year's performance ratings, the financial difficulties faced by the three PCTs, and an apparent cooling off at ministerial level on the care trust model, means the proposed start date has been dropped.</p>
      <p>"Care trusts are still on the agenda," says Jones. "We are in a strong position. But we will have to see where the government wants to take this."</p>
      <p>One of the major worries for PCTs has been GP shortages, although a recent British Medical Association survey suggests the south-west is suffering less than the rest of the country. Its poll of 150 English PCTs, published in January, included 11 in the south-west.</p>
      <p>The worst affected south-west PCT was North and East Cornwall. Of its vacancies, 2.91% of these went unfilled for longer than three months, compared to an English average of 3.40% and considerably less than the 16% three month vacancy rate in Greenwich, south London. Two PCTs, South Gloucestershire and East Hampshire reported no vacancies.</p>
      <p>"A year ago we did have problems with GP recruitment and retention, and the ups and down surrounding the GP contract have not helped," says Sheila Clark, chief executive of Portsmouth City PCT. "But the problem has not got worse. Introducing a salaried GP scheme and becoming a teaching PCT has helped. It has taken some of the stress out of GP work and that has helped us with retention."</p>
      <p>Despite financial, managerial and political pressures, PCTs in the region remain optimistic. "I'm not complacent," says Clark, "but what we have in Portsmouth is a pretty firm foundation for continuing to make progress."</p>

      <title>The Soviet 70s: how Russians made pools of light in the totalitarian darkness</title>
      <subtitle>On the centenary of the revolution, my memories are of people defying the regime around the kicthen table, with a togetherness missing in western lives</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>As the world commemorates the centenary of the Russian Revolution, the focus is rightly on the horrors of the regime it ushered in.</p>
      <p>Russians, and their captive nations, suffered a century of almost inconceivable pain. Tens of millions perished in the revolution and civil war, in the forced collectivisation of farming, the terror of the 1930s, and the second world war. Then came the postwar repressions, and finally the tumult of the end of communism and the bewildering attempts to introduce capitalism and democracy. Russians should be forgiven for being traumatised by their recent history.</p>
      <p>The intelligentsia's response was 'internal emigration': free thinking actually stimulated by the lack of freedom</p>
      <p>I lived in the Soviet Union for two years in the 1970s, at the height of the cold war, under the dead hand of Leonid Brezhnev's rule. It was a state that isolated itself from the world, in which the Communist party attempted to exercise total ideological control. It believed that central state planners could organise the economy more efficiently than the market. In fact, the planned economy turned out to be barely controlled chaos, further muddled by everyday corruption and sheer bloody-mindedness. If a shop assistant was more interested in painting her nails than in serving you, there was little you could do about it.</p>
      <p>Yet somehow the memory I retain most strongly is not of oppression and empty shops, but of a society that thrived on something that was missing in our hectic western lives - a sense of togetherness and sharing, by which Russians contrived to beat the system. Sugar and hope were equally scarce commodities, and friends shared them generously. What looked at first sight like a downtrodden nation was in fact a people practising passive, sullen, unspoken resistance to evil, helping each other to survive the idiocies imposed upon them by the system.</p>
      <p>If I were to design a monument to the Soviet Union it would be a kitchen table. Around it would be seated a group of friends, cigarettes and vodka glasses in hand, a loaf of bread and some pickled gherkins on the table. One friend stares wistfully out of the window. On a shelf, a tape recorder plays songs by the wonderful singer poets Okudzhava or Vysotsky, pouring out the pain that had no other outlet, on scratchy cassettes dubbed and redubbed and passed from hand to hand. On a stool lies a pile of "thick journals", Russia's literary magazines, which once in a while would include some gem of subversion or satire.</p>
      <p>The intelligentsia's response to totalitarianism was "internal emigration". In this world free thinking was actually stimulated by the lack of official freedom. Shortwave radio broadcasts provided the single lifeline to the world outside the cocoon in which the Communist party attempted to wrap its citizens. Western stations such as the Voice of America, the BBC and Radio Liberty were known collectively as "voices". I remember sometimes hearing their call-signs at night, ringing out in the darkness from a nearby apartment, and you knew that there were people around who thirsted for the truth. Without the invention of radio, the Soviet authorities could have kept their citizens in complete darkness.</p>
      <p>Two of my best friends were prominent scientists. I asked them once what they had been doing in 1968, the year Soviet tanks crushed the Prague Spring, and students staged revolts across western Europe. They had been on an expedition, camping in khaki tents in the Tian Shan mountains, singing quietly rebellious songs around a camp fire, their backs firmly turned against the anti-western hysteria coming out of the Kremlin. Later they took refuge in the "scientists' city" of Novosibirsk, where thought control was less stringent. They even held folk festivals there for banned singers.</p>
      <p>Related: Putin's Russia can't celebrate its revolutionary past. It has to smother it | Catherine Merridale</p>
      <p>For the intelligentsia, "Soviet" life - with its propaganda and party indoctrination sessions - went on beyond an imaginary fence. They observed it from a distance, like a dance of demons round a fire, while they created for themselves a better world of integrity and honesty, far from the century's horrors.</p>
      <p>The working classes had their own way of shunning the state, summed up in the words: "They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work." And people of every class found joy in the small, simple pleasures of life - in friendship, sharing, laughter, walks in the forest. In the pervasive atmosphere of fear and suspicion the only people you could really trust were your closest family and friends.</p>
      <p>The kitchen table conversations were a little warm pool of light in the totalitarian darkness. Today it's different. My Russian friends say those meaningful (drunken) conversations about life have given way to the mundane preoccupations of western societies - jobs, money, holidays, gadgets.</p>
      <p>No one would wish back the darkness. But it's a shame that mellow light had to go out too.</p>

      <title>Weekend: A COLD SHOULDER FOR SADDAM'S VICTIMS: The government uses Saddam's persecution of Iraqis as a justification for war. But when those same people escape to the UK, they are given a wretched reception.</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In a sparsely furnished lounge in a flat on the 14th floor of a Salford tower block, a group of Iraqi Kurdish asylum seekers gather to talk. Their hosts, Mohammed Saeed and Aso Baram, make them welcome, observing Kurdish hospitality in spite of their poverty, handing round a dish of strawberries.</p>
      <p>Three of the men have been given permission to remain in the UK, two others have had their appeals rejected and are technically homeless, and a third has had his initial claim turned down; the rest are in limbo, waiting for a decision on their claims. These young men, and many hundreds like them, lead lives of longing for the homes they have left, of uncertainty about their futures, and of fear for the family and friends they left behind.</p>
      <p>It is an unpalatable irony that the UK government, in the midst of its crusade to liberate the people of Iraq from Saddam Hussein's tyranny, should be giving such a wretched welcome to many of those who have escaped his regime, condemning them to misery in our cities or sending them back where they came from. For Iraqis from Saddam-controlled Iraq, "enforced removals are not possible", a Home Office spokeswoman says. However, different rules will "shortly" apply for Iraqi Kurds, she adds. Even as war loomed, Iraqi Kurdistan was considered a safe haven for deportees. Until now, the Home Office has not gone so far as to forcibly eject Iraqi Kurds because none of the bordering countries would accept asylum seekers in transit. This has not prevented the National Asylum Support Service (Nass) issuing letters to Iraqi Kurds instructing them to leave the UK immediately.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years, Iraqis have accounted for the largest number of UK asylum seekers. In 2001, 6,210 were refused asylum; how many subsequently won their appeals is unknown. The following year, the situation improved: of nearly 12,000 Iraqi applicants, some 9,000 were granted "exceptional leave to remain" or, in a few cases, refugee status. Now, exceptional leave, which guaranteed four years' asylum, is being replaced - for Iraqis coming to the UK as war breaks out - by a new category, "humanitarian protection", which permits only six months' stay. In 2002, of the 3,000 refused leave to stay, 60%-70% were again rejected on appeal. Unable to go home, many of them will now be destitute.</p>
      <p>The Home Office will not give a breakdown of how many of these applicants are from Saddam-controlled Iraq and how many are Iraqi Kurds. On the ground, in drop-in centres and in bleak hotels and hostels, you meet many more Iraqi Kurds - it is not clear whether this is because it is easier, or more urgent, for them to escape, or whether non-Kurdish Iraqis are treated more sympathetically in this country and are less caught up in the bureaucratic quagmire that is the lot of most asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>There are exceptions. I met Wafa at a meeting of an Iraqi refugee group in a London pub. She and her husband had been tortured in front of each other during several months in prison in Iraq. She was released, her husband was executed. She had to leave Iraq when an underground magazine she had been distributing fell into the wrong hands. She came to the UK in a truck and was dropped somewhere, she doesn't know where. Luckily, she met a woman who took her in for the night and the next day she applied for asylum "in country". She needed to do so in a hurry: Section 55 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, which became law in January, denies support to refugees who fail to claim asylum as soon as is "reasonably practicable" after arriving; in some cases, this is being interpreted as within as little as 24 hours. After a day being interviewed or waiting to be interviewed, without anything to eat or drink, Wafa was turned out on to the street with nowhere to go.</p>
      <p>The Section 55 ruling was condemned in February in the high court as transgressing the European convention on human rights, but the home secretary, David Blunkett, plans to challenge this. The situation has eased thanks to the court's intervention, but if Blunkett is successful, Iraqi refugees fleeing from war could find themselves in the same plight as Wafa.</p>
      <p>Mohammed Saeed, the host in the tower block flat that day, has exceptional leave, a flat to live in and some financial support. He and his flatmate Baram have become community leaders for Salford and Manchester's homeless Iraqi Kurdish refugee communities. (Manchester's refugee community is one of the biggest outside London.) They began to build a social network after meeting through Dr Rhetta Moran, a sociologist from Salford University's Revans Institute, who has developed a research project with Salford's refugee community.</p>
      <p>Farman Kdir is a shy 22-year-old. His father was an army officer with the Iraqi forces and his family lived in the city of Mosul, which is within Iraq, but very near Iraqi Kurdistan. It is dangerous territory at the best of times, and his father was working secretly against the regime, says Farman. One night his father woke him and his brother. He told them that they were to take possession of guns coming in by mule over the demarcation line from Iraqi Kurdistan. Iraqi security forces ambushed them. His father and brother were caught and are now, he thinks, in a Baghdad prison. Farman escaped.</p>
      <p>His asylum claim has been rejected. "They didn't believe me because I have no evidence," he said. He pins his hopes on getting leave to appeal. He is depressed and finds it hard to concentrate on anything. He sleeps a lot.</p>
      <p>All the men in the room have lost someone to Saddam's regime - vanished, tortured or executed. Beside Farman sits a man in his 30s, Marewan Rasoul Rashid, who arrived, as do most Iraqi Kurds, in the back of a truck. They take their chances on the asylum route: many don't make it, dying in freezing conditions on border crossings through Turkey or caught by hostile Turkish authorities; there are reports of others drowning as overloaded traffickers' boats sink on the crossing from Greece to Italy. Nobody wants to dwell on the details of their journeys. The trucks are horrible, they say - the traffickers put you in a compartment behind boxes, they let you out once at night for a few minutes, they give you no food or water, it's very cold.</p>
      <p>Marewan had a successful restaurant in Kirkuk, an oil-rich Kurdish city just inside Iraq. One night, two of his customers were assassinated. I ask if it was reported in local newspapers and they all laugh - only pictures of Saddam and his speeches make the papers, they tell me. Marewan was imprisoned and tortured: "Beating, electric shock, they asked me who shot these people." While he was in prison he witnessed a mass execution in a "field". (In Tony Blair's recent dossier on Iraq, there are details of mass prison executions; in one, 3,000 people were said to have been machine-gunned in part of the prison known as "the garden".) The Iraqi authorities then offered Marewan a deal: if he worked for them as an agent in Iraqi Kurdistan, they would release him. He agreed, but as soon as he was freed, he left the country.</p>
      <p>On arrival in the UK, Marewan was given temporary admission, which is renewable every two months. He is desperate to resolve his claim for asylum, but has been unable to speak to his lawyer despite repeatedly leaving messages. He asks if I would ring the firm. I do, and it turns out that the solicitor whose card Marewan has carried in his wallet for a year has not worked in the practice for almost that entire time.</p>
      <p>Neither Marewan nor Farman can work - asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected or remain unresolved are forbidden to do so - and it's hard to survive on the Nass handouts of pounds 25-pounds 37 a week; tales of 12-hour shifts in sweatshops for pounds 20 to eke out the allowance are common.</p>
      <p>Rebwar Kemal has been here four months and is more optimistic than the others, even though he is still waiting for his immigration interview. He used to have a photography shop in Kirkuk. "The Iraqi authorities wanted me to take photographs, to spy. They force people to go to Kurdistan and cause explosions, to harass and assassinate their enemies. I refused." He also resisted joining Saddam's "volunteer" army. Such defiance is suicidal in Iraq. He had to leave.</p>
      <p>These men may be in an uneasy limbo, waiting for the results of their asylum claims, but they at least have hope, unlike one of their companions. Soran (not his real name) reached the end of the UK asylum appeals process last June - he was refused. Since then he has been destitute, dependent on other asylum seekers, one of whom had given him pounds 2.50 for his bus fare to Salford from Bolton, where he is sleeping on someone's floor.</p>
      <p>When his appeal was rejected, Soran got the standard letter from Nass telling the rejected asylum seeker to pick up his final payment cheque and leave his accommodation within seven days. Then it reads: "There is no right to appeal against this decision and (you) should make immediate arrangements to vacate the premises. You must now leave the United Kingdom." The letter provides the number of an immigration service helpline for advice on returning home. Bearing in mind the difficulties of returning to a war zone, I rang the number to ask what advice they had for a recipient of this letter. An irritated woman said, "We don't provide that service." Baffled, I repeated the question. "We're just voluntary departures," she said, growing more exasperated. The confusion is mind-boggling - they tell people such as Soran to leave, knowing that he can't and doesn't want to; they offer a helpline, but it's only for people who want to leave.</p>
      <p>Returning home is simply not an option for Iraqi Kurdish asylum seekers, for several reasons. They arrive here via underground routes run by agents and traffickers. It's the only way out. There is no way back. Because Iraqi Kurdistan is not diplomatically recognised, most do not have the necessary travel documentation. Even if they did, to make it viable they would need to get it stamped by the authorities in Baghdad. This, says Ihsan Qadir, an adviser to the Commons all-party committee on Iraqi Kurdistan, is impossible.</p>
      <p>When Soran got the letter last summer telling him to leave the UK, he received another from his landlord. Failure to vacate within seven days, it told him, would result in "legal action against you, which you will have to pay for". The letter ended: "Good luck for the future." When he moved out, his landlord gave him 100g rice and some oil in an empty film canister. Soran is proud, dignified, cautious and, despite his homelessness, dapper and exact. He carries a neat plastic folder containing all his legal correspondence. Despite his superficial poise, he is deeply traumatised. He has nowhere to live, no right to work, no source of income - nothing but his folder, the clothes he stands in and the goodwill of others. Since last July, he has been dossing with fellow Kurds, always on the move, so as not to outstay his welcome.</p>
      <p>He tells me he has nothing to do but think, and makes circular motions with his index finger pointing to his head. He is afraid to tell his story, saying it is enough to say that Islamic fundamentalists put a fatwa on him in his home in Sulaimaniya in Iraqi Kurdistan. He did not want to flee in the back of a truck to a strange country with nothing to his name, leaving a good life behind him. He just wanted to stay alive.</p>
      <p>Middle East expert Sheri Laizer provides a dozen law firms with "expert witness" analysis of asylum claims. She says that senior political figures in Kurdistan never travel without bodyguards, fearful of attacks by fundamentalists who have killed officials of the two ruling parties in Iraqi Kurdistan, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). "The Islamists represent a highly militant strand of Islam," says Laizer. "Their goal is to create an Islamic state in Kurdistan. This is a serious ongoing situation, and one that threatens further violence. People against whom fatwas have been issued cannot safely go about their activities."</p>
      <p>In an ironic twist, Soran might manage to stay in the UK when the plans to deport Kurds are finalised (shortly), because the immigration snatch squads that round up people for return to their countries will have difficulty finding people such as him who are of no fixed abode.</p>
      <p>The dangers awaiting returning Iraqi Kurds are well-known to the British government. "Under Saddam's rule, Iraq's Kurdish communities have experienced terrible suffering . . . the persecution of the Kurds continues today," reads a recent dossier used by Tony Blair to justify war against Iraq. The list of atrocities against the Kurds includes the chemical attacks in Halabja in March 1988, which left 5,000 dead and thousands maimed, the subsequent expulsion of 94,000 Kurds from Iraq, the massacre or disappearance of almost 200,000 people and the razing of 4,000 villages. The Kurds themselves are as convinced as Blair and Bush that Saddam still has chemical weapons, and are terrified that he will use them in Kurdistan again.</p>
      <p>The territory is vulnerable and unstable, a geopolitical pawn eyed by its more powerful neighbours. In 1991, after the crushed uprising by Kurds in the north and Shi'a Arabs in the south, more than one million Iraqi citizens became refugees as they fled to the mountains on the Turkish and Iranian borders. Hundreds died, some pounded by Saddam's helicopter gunships, others freezing to death or killed by Turkish security forces preventing them from crossing into Turkey. It was after this that the UN created the so-called Kurdish Autonomous Area, also known as the safe haven and as Iraqi Kurdistan. In the run-up to war, the US offered Turkey billions of dollars in exchange for allowing 60,000 US troops on to Turkish soil for incursions into Iraq via Kurdistan. At the time of writing, Turkey had refused the deal. Should the Turkish attitude change, many Kurds fear the outbreak of war would enable Turkey to invade and rid itself of an independent Kurdistan on its border - it already has 5,000 troops stationed along the border .</p>
      <p>Iraqi Kurdistan is no place to go home to - even the KDP and PUK, nominally backing a war against Saddam, agree with that. But the alternatives here for refugees are destitution or the aptly named "hard cases support" administered by Nass. People such as Soran, who have had their appeals rejected, can apply for hard cases support, which, at the discretion of Nass, confers board and lodging at a YMCA, but no cash. According to the Home Office, there have been 1,600 applications for such support since April 2002.</p>
      <p>Tony Fuller, head of development and human resources at Migrant Helpline (one of six voluntary agencies funded by the Home Office to assist asylum seekers), has heard conflicting accounts about how many are successful in their application: "The system is operated haphazardly by Nass. The voluntary sector reports that only a very small proportion of destitute Iraqi asylum seekers actually receive hard case support. One set of figures from the Home Office indicates that, between July and September 2002, in excess of 700 Iraqis were without any form of support at all."</p>
      <p>At the Portsmouth Area Refugee Support drop-in centre, they see increasing numbers of destitute young Iraqis, including, in the last week of February, one man who had been injured in a bomb blast in Iraq. It was below freezing, and he didn't think he'd survive a night on the street. Similar stories of homelessness are reported from Manchester, Dover, Margate, Liverpool, London and Glasgow. One leading charity has been forced to send people away with maps of soup kitchens because current rulings prevent them from housing asylum seekers either on arrival or at the end of their appeals.</p>
      <p>Those who are granted hard cases support receive a letter telling them that accommodation is provided on a "no choice" basis, in most cases away from London and the south-east. The accommodation is in one of a dozen YMCAs. The organisation says it is currently housing 93 people in this category. If asylum seekers leave their designated YMCA, they forfeit their hard cases support and are left with nothing.</p>
      <p>Along with destitution comes racist abuse. Michelle Cox, a nurse at the Great Homer Street Medical Centre in Liverpool, which operates a drop-in service, says that a year ago they had 10 destitute asylum seekers spending time there. Two of these, young Iraqi Kurds, were sent to the Grimsby YMCA on hard cases support. But the town of Grimsby wasn't ready for asylum seekers and they were attacked by racist youths. They returned to Liverpool, to sleep in derelict cars and parks. Cox says there are now 120 destitute asylum seekers coming through the drop-in centre, 80 of them Iraqis.</p>
      <p>Racist abuse is part of an asylum seeker's daily experience - although the men at Saeed's flat also say that many English people have been kind. The abuse comes mostly from gangs of teenage boys who accuse them of being terrorists. Marewan says that there have been fights and knife attacks.</p>
      <p>The UN has predicted an exodus of 1.5 million people from Iraq in the event of war. However, the British government does not expect the number of Iraqi asylum seekers arriving here to increase dramatically, according to Tony Fuller of Migrant Helpline, "because of the increased security on the French coast".</p>
      <p>This came about as part of quid pro quo with the French government last December: Britain agreed to allow 1,000 Iraqi Kurdish asylum seekers into Britain on work permits (lasting four years, and on condition that they did not apply for asylum); in return, the French closed Sangatte camp in Calais, and allowed the UK immigration services increased powers along the French coast to prevent asylum seekers getting into the UK. "The government apparently believes," says Fuller, "that most Iraqi refugees fleeing the war will end up in Iran and other parts of the Middle East. Whether or not this assessment is overly optimistic, it is certainly questionable on ethical grounds. It is morally indefensible to erect security barriers to prevent refugees from entering the UK when those very refugees are displaced precisely because of a war conducted by the UK."</p>
      <p>Blair's dossier talks the talk - "Iraq is a terrifying place to live. People are in constant fear of being denounced as opponents of the regime. Between three and four million Iraqis, some 15% of the population, have fled their homes rather than live under Saddam Hussein's regime" - but the tone changes when these same people find their way to this country.</p>
      <p>Azim Younis had 10,000 hectares of farmland near Kirkuk. The Iraqi authorities took it by force. When someone broke under torture and gave his name as a member of an opposition group, the security forces came looking for him, but Azim wasn't there so they took his brother instead. "Brother, sister, mother, father - they take anyone they find," he says. Azim, an Iraqi Kurd, has been in the UK for more than two years, and is housed by Nass at a grim hostel in Manchester where I saw cockroaches. He is still waiting to hear the outcome of his claim for asylum. Sitting in a spiritless kitchen under a dim lightbulb, he smooths out a letter on the table. Dated last April, it's from the immigration department of the Home Office apologising for their failure to reach a decision in his case. At the bottom of the letter is their slogan: "Building a safe, just and tolerant society."</p>
      <p>Ahmed (not his real name), an Iraqi from Baghdad, fled aged 18 in August 2000. He knows what a "terrifying place to live" Iraq can be, even - or especially - if you have close links to the regime. His father was a "legal translator for senior officers in the presidency of Iraq". Ahmed doesn't know much about what his father did, because his work was secret. One night in July 2000 his father did not come home; his mother became anxious. Glancing out of the window, she saw some men approaching the house and swiftly hid her son in the attic. The men searched the house and, after 10 minutes, took his mother away.</p>
      <p>A family friend warned Ahmed of the danger he was in and arranged for him to be taken by an agent to London. Abandoned by the agent who brought him in, Ahmed did as he had been told and approached immigration officers at passport control. He was taken to a room and questioned by two men. " 'You're a liar,' they kept saying to me. They took my photo and fingerprints and I was terrified, I thought I would be taken to prison." He was taken to emergency Nass accommodation, where for six weeks he shared a small room with a man he never spoke to. "I felt completely lost." In spite of everything, he has since managed to get several A and A/S levels with excellent grades and has begun a university course.</p>
      <p>Ahmed received a rejection letter after his asylum interview in November 2000, but the reasons for refusal were not sent for almost another two years. One of the grounds given was the Home Office's inability to understand why the security forces failed to find Ahmed on the night his mother was taken. It is difficult to imagine what the bureaucrat involved was thinking when he implicitly blamed Ahmed for not being caught that night in July 2000. The Home Office also found that Ahmed had "not demonstrated" that he was "likely to be of adverse interest to the authorities should (he) return to Iraq". They were suspicious because it had taken a week for his friend to arrange false papers and an exit route. Sheri Laizer was an expert witness in Ahmed's case: "Any Iraqi citizen will tell you that if the finger has pointed at your family, your life will not be safe one moment longer."</p>
      <p>All the asylum seekers I spoke to - the men in the Salford flat, Azim in his hostel, Ahmed in London - long for the overthrow of Saddam, but none of them welcomes the war. War is not the solution, says Ahmed, and in the next breath, his voice faltering, he says he can't stop thinking about his parents.</p>
      <p>Ahmed heard last week that he had won his appeal. It is not clear yet whether he will be granted refugee status, or simply temporary permission to stay. And that's about as close as it gets in this story to a happy ending</p>

      <title>G2: Arts: 40 years of wicked wit and wisdom: In tribute to Simon Hoggart, the Guardian columnist, who died on Sunday, here are a selection of extracts from some of his finest and funniest articles</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Christmas round robins</p>
      <p>27 December 1997</p>
      <p>Those round robin letters that people tuck into Christmas cards have suffered from ridicule lately, not least because their news seems to be always unremittingly good.</p>
      <p>"Work on our Umbrian farmhouse proceeds apace, with the swimming pool almost finished in spite of the best efforts of the Italian authorities! So it will be 'welcome, gentles all' next summer, and we hope to see many of you passing through. Tatiana's hard work and lashings of 'midnight oil' resulted in four As at A-level, and a coveted place at Balliol, preceded by a gap year on a well-drilling project in Angola . . . sadly, Rob's father (Doug, aged 87) passed away peacefully at his nursing home in Thurso during October, though a conflict with Rob's acceptance of his Design Centre award prevented us from attending the funeral. But the plaque has pride of place on our mantelpiece!"</p>
      <p>Now the self-deprecating circular is fashionable, and we've had a few this year.</p>
      <p>"Much excitement during our Cretan villa holiday, as Tarquin was arrested in a local disco for buying some of the dreaded weed after his release (a bundle of notes equivalent to the National Debt of Chad having changed hands) we were all able to see the funny side! Late payments and 'overstretch' meant that Jim's business went 'belly-up' in October, so we were able to try at first hand Tony Blair's principles of Welfare to Work. Turns out that there's no work, and precious little welfare! Jessica's GCSEs were disappointing, to put it mildly . . . On a brighter note, Munchkin, our two-year-old Siamese, got rid of a nasty tapeworm."</p>
      <p>I exaggerate, but only slightly. The trouble with all these processed letters is that they are never quite right for the recipient, either telling you too much about people you barely know, or, if they are among your dearest friends, a pile of old news. But the alternative, a personal handwritten message, can be worse. One of our cards this year contained the names of four in a five-person family, with the single line: "Stephen walked out on us all in April."</p>
      <p>William Hague at the Tory conference</p>
      <p>13 October 1977</p>
      <p>There will soon be a new word in the language: to heseltine, meaning to build up a monumental pile of blonde hair, fix it in place with a complicated system of scaffolding and webs, and then spray it with lacquer. It would be advertised in hairdressers: "Unisex shampoo and heseltine, £3."</p>
      <p>Young men have their hair specially heseltined for their first speech at a Tory conference . . .</p>
      <p>One young man who had obviously had his hair heseltined for the day was a 16-year-old from the Rother valley called William Hague. One hesitates to say too much about the young men at this Tory conference, except that there are an awful lot of them and they are terrifyingly confident.</p>
      <p>Young William had a surprisingly elderly-sounding Yorkshire accent, which made his voice sound almost exactly like Harold Wilson's, to the obvious confusion of delegates who had their backs turned. He had, however, a far greater command of the cliche than the former prime minister, and he marked the economic debate with phrases such as "rolling back the frontiers of the state", "home-owning democracy", "large and progressive cuts in public spending", and "a society where effort and initiative are rewarded". The sight of these aged saws coming from so young a head had the entire conference on its feet at the end of his speech.</p>
      <p>The most disconcerting thing of all was that William did not even look surprised as Mrs Thatcher herself leant over from the platform to applaud him. He merely seemed faintly pleased, as if he had won the hundred-yard dash or the school prize for diligence.</p>
      <p>Stupid labels and signs</p>
      <p>27 March 1999</p>
      <p>Geoffrey Mann bought a packet containing a scart lead, the thing you use to connect your DVD player to the TV. It warns: "If in doubt, consult a qualified electrician." Since nobody needs a qualified electrician to tell them how to push a plug into a socket, Mr Mann wonders whether it is referring to existential doubt, and that an electrician might help. "We can be live, or we can be neutral about life. But we must always remain earthed." Actually, I would give a lot to know what the stupid EU colour code is.</p>
      <p>Tony Blair's first party conference speech as leader</p>
      <p>5 October 1994</p>
      <p>Tony Blair scooped the Labour party in his strong arms yesterday, gazed long into eyes like amber pools of light, and told it how deeply he cared. Then almost before the party knew what was happening, he led it, softly yet insistently, towards the bedroom door.</p>
      <p>The speech was as artful a seduction as I've seen. He left the party quivering with anticipation, helpless in the face of his throbbing desire for office. Which leaves the question of whether, like James Hewitt, Mr Blair will turn out to be a Love Rat.</p>
      <p>This is, of course, the view of the left, and specifically Arthur Scargill, who sat scowling during what was probably the longest standing ovation a Labour leader has received.</p>
      <p>But he was virtually alone. Around him people cheered and bayed their support. In the plangent words of Anna Pasternak, "it was too beautiful a love to remain a secret".</p>
      <p>The speech included some dazzling sleight of hand. The ending of Clause Four was never even mentioned, being murmured in the party's ear as "it is time we had a clear, up-to-date statement of the object and objectives of our party", and cunningly linked to the name of John Prescott, who has in this business the same role as the princess's detective - aware of what is going on, but powerless to prevent it. It took the delegates quite some time to realise what Mr Blair meant. We journalists, however, were luckier, since we had the benefit of Mr Blair's spin-doctors.</p>
      <p>This profession, once thought unnecessary, has now become a youth employment scheme with starred firsts in osculatory medicine.</p>
      <p>This is necessary, since quite a lot of Mr Blair's speech did require at least a gentle twirl. For instance, a boilerplate attack on the Home Secretary ended with a passage that could have come from a Daily Express leader: "Michael Howard said he was building six tough new prisons. Butlins wouldn't win the contract, he said. He was right. The Savoy got it."</p>
      <p>His style is to pass over the reality and get on to the dream. After that he was free to rouse the party's fantasies. And the special achievement of the spin doctor is to furnish innumerable explanations of each passage, so that a single oration becomes a blend of several speeches, the pattern emerging, as in those Magic Eye books, only after you squint at it for hours.</p>
      <p>But that's enough Labour party metaphors for one day. It now remains to be seen whether they still respect Tony Blair in the morning. They certainly adored him last night.</p>
      <p>Budget night at the opera</p>
      <p>28 March 1980</p>
      <p>The souvenir programme promised "knights, esquires, ladies, ruffians, pages, maskers, soldiers, ushers, halberdiers, cupbearers and gondoliers." How true, and that was only the audience. You should have seen the stage.</p>
      <p>On to it walked Joan Sutherland. She was wearing even more jewels than the Queen Mother. If their tiaras had met, they would have fused all the lights. Her voice was superlative, soaring above even the rustle of chocolate wrappers and the rumbling of tummies waiting for the first batch of smoked salmon sandwiches. You could tell it was gala night, because the intervals were almost as long as the acts.</p>
      <p>You can tell the very rich by their evening dress: the more they earn, the sillier it is. One man wore something that looked like a pair of paisley pyjamas with a black tie on top. Some wore quilted affairs like sawn-off dressing gowns. Others had yards of ruffling on their shirts, so their chests were puffed out like swans on heat.</p>
      <p>Sir Richard Branson and the national lottery</p>
      <p>13 January 2001</p>
      <p>I had to go to Oxford one evening this week. On the train I saw a newspaper picture of the dejected Sir Richard Branson, who has decided not to go to law in a last attempt to win the national lottery franchise. As I stepped off, the station PA system was announcing that a Virgin train to Manchester, due in five minutes, had been not merely delayed, but cancelled. There, I reflected, are a dozen or so people who won't get to Manchester tonight, and who will now curse the name of Branson - to say nothing of hundreds of others along the route.</p>
      <p>I suspect the Branson story will be taught as a case study to future generations of business students, warning them how easy it is to destroy an excellent brand image. Five years ago Branson was seen as an amiable entrepreneur in a sweater who had the novel idea of offering innovation and good value on a wide range of services. Then he bought a train company. Since then many of his enterprises, Virgin Cola, record shops and clothing, have flopped, and he's had to sell half of his one great acknowledged success, Virgin Atlantic, to pay off his debts.</p>
      <p>Last year the author Tom Bower brought out a critical biography, in spite of the worst that Branson's multitudinous lawyers could do none of whom has yet managed to land a glove on the book. I was not surprised to learn that all the lottery commissioners had read this book before giving the franchise straight back to Camelot.</p>
      <p>A cunningly cultivated image might work for a while, but it won't last unless it reflects reality. The reality is that Branson is just another grasping, ambitious businessman. By now the public realises it too. I doubt that his temporary half-price ticket offer will do much to restore matters.</p>
      <p>Farewell to Margaret Thatcher</p>
      <p>8 April 2013</p>
      <p>Clive James says that if you lack a sense of humour you have no sense of proportion, and she probably had neither. "The lady's not for turning" had to be explained carefully, and only went into the speech on sufferance. When Callaghan compared himself to Moses, her speech included the line "keep taking the tablets". She didn't get it and wanted to say "keep taking the pills".</p>
      <p>Her double entendres were unintentional but much loved: bending over an apprentice in Putney ("I've never seen a tool as big as that!") or declining to fire a field gun on her Falklands victory tour ("Won't it jerk me off?"). Hundreds of people record having to stifle laughter because the thing they dreaded most was being asked to explain what was so funny.</p>
      <p>By the end, she thought she could do everything better than everyone else. Someone who was there described her annual visit to Balmoral. The royals have a picnic and, once a year, the Queen washes up in a little hut. Thatcher tried - but failed - to stop her and do it herself, because she could do the dishes and run the country more efficiently than anyone. At all.</p>
      <p>But the story that sums up her whole style was when she was a guest at the press gallery children's party and was being shown around by Father Christmas. They came upon a small boy crying into his dessert. "Miss," said the boy, "they've given me blancmange, and I don't like blancmange!"</p>
      <p>"That," she said sweetly, "is what parties are all about - eating food you don't like." And it was her recipe for government, too.</p>

      <title>Comment &amp; Debate: It's up to the superdelegates to prove Democrats believe in democracy: It will be a travesty if party apparatchiks choose a presidential candidate against the wishes of ordinary voters</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In December, the president of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, stood for re-election. Karimov, a one-time ally in the "war on terror" who in 2002 had one opposition leader boiled alive, has long faced criticism from human rights groups and the United Nations. Having already served two terms, he was he was not even eligible to stand. A minor detail for a man like Karimov. His three opponents all endorsed him and did not ask Uzbeks to vote for them. Those who would notendorse him were disqualified and imprisoned. Karimov won the day with 88.1% of the vote.</p>
      <p>There is a profound difference between holding an election and having a democracy. Elections are the best means that we have come up with so far for giving people a voice in the running of their affairs. Democracy is the system which ensures that voices are heard by empowering them with the ability to change those who run our affairs.</p>
      <p>Elections, in and of themselves, are a purely technical matter. The authorities name the day, tell the voters, provide the booths and the equipment. The voters make their choice. The authorities then tally the results. But, as we know from countless incidences, from Kenya to Florida, the technical elides effortlessly into the political. Which day? Which voters? Where are the booths? How does the equipment work? Who's counting? Whose votes count? All this has a bearing on the result. That's why democracy, if it is working, gives us the right to kick out the authorities.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of January, the Democratic party in the US has held elections that have provided great excitement and held the attention of much of the world. We are about to see if its commitment to democracy is equally impressive. Having started this election season with scenes of rural folk gathering in frontrooms and schoolhalls to stand up and be counted, the final decision is now likely to be made by party apparatchiks accountable only to themselves. Or worse still, the courts.</p>
      <p>For the one thing we do know at this stage is that unless something dramatic happens, winning the Democratic primaries and winning the Democratic nomination will not be the same thing. The elections we have all been watching account for 80% of the total voting delegates who will nominate the candidate. The remaining 20% goes to "superdelegates" - Democratic legislators, governors, former presidents and vice-presidents, and other party officials.</p>
      <p>At present, Barack Obama is winning by a narrow margin. By most calculations, voters have given him around 133more elected delegates than Hillary Clinton - a mere one-eighth of the total in states yet to vote. Predictions of Clinton's imminent demise - like most other predictions in this race - are premature. It is far more conceivable that she will turn this around by April than itwas on New Year's Day that Obama would be the frontrunner. This race has the peculiar distinction of being both volatile and close.</p>
      <p>So close in fact that the superdelegates will almost certainly determine the outcome. If they do, it will not just have the potential of making the entire process a travesty of democracy but also a tragedy for the Democratic party. For if the superdelegates go against the popular will of the voters, whoever emerges as "victor" will enter the presidential election shorn of democratic legitimacy and devoid of electoral credibility. Indeed in much the same shape as George Bush emerged in 2000 after Florida.</p>
      <p>In short, it would be a monumental own goal. The Democrats are passionate about their candidates. A recent Gallup poll showed that 80% of Democrats were more enthusiastic about voting this year than in previous elections - the highest figure since the question was first asked in 2000. Meanwhile, almost 50% of Republicans said they were less enthusiastic than usual - also the highest on record. This enthusiasm has been borne out in the polls. So far 15.7 million Democrats have voted in primaries compared with just 10.9 million Republicans. In Virginia, a swing state waiting to happen, Obama received more votes than the entire Republican field combined.</p>
      <p>The effect of party officials overturning whatever decision the voters make would be to squander all the energy and hopefulness that has characterised the campaign so far, leaving the millions who have been drawn into the process for the first time disaffected. Whoever feels hard done by is likely to stay at home during the presidential election.</p>
      <p>And that's before we get to Florida and Michigan. These two states decided to hold their primaries in January, in defiance of Democratic party rules. The party warned them beforehand that if they persisted their delegations would be disqualified. They went ahead anyway. The party asked the candidates not to campaign in those states. The candi dates obliged. The elections went ahead without them - Clinton won both, but Obama's name was not even on the ballot in Michigan. Now Clinton's camp wants to change the rules and is calling for those delegates to count. The lawyers are on standby.</p>
      <p>All this would present a much-needed gift to the Republicans, who are struggling with entirely different demons. They have chosen a candidate. The trouble is, they don't like him. Or at least not enough of them. John McCain, who, barring a miracle, will be nominated in August, was booed last week at an American Conservative Union conference. Since then, his attempt to pose as the presumptive nominee has appeared, well, presumptuous.</p>
      <p>Mike Huckabee may not stand a prayer of winning enough delegates to beat McCain at this point - even if he won every contest (which he won't)by a 60-40 margin (which he definitely won't), McCain would still be the nominee. But Huckabee believes in miracles and prays a lot. Last week in Virginia, where McCain won just 51%, henearly pulled it off. When 49% of an electorate turn out to vote for candidates they know cannot win, they are really voting against the candidate they know will win.</p>
      <p>Conversely, while the Democrats may be evenly divided, they are not rancorously split. Atthis stage, the overwhelming majority would be happy if either Clinton or Obama won. That could change depending on how they win. Obama says superdelegates should respect the wishes of the voters; Clinton says they are part of the process and should exercise their independent judgment. Clinton has found relatively few takers for her position so far.</p>
      <p>But these are early days. Over the past few weeks Clinton's huge superdelegate lead has dwindled with her electoral performance. Over the weekend, a number of African-American superdelegates abandoned her and pledged to back Obama, who has a narrow lead in both regular and superdelegates combined. Before this process is over, each candidate could be arguing the opposite.</p>
      <p>"It would be a problem for the party ifthe verdict would be something different than the public has decided," said Nancy Pelosi, the House of Representatives' speaker. Too true. But while Pelosi's argument answers the question about what the superdelegates should do at the party convention in August, it begs another. If superdelegates are going to follow the popular vote anyway, why have them in the first place?</p>

      <title>Greece in crisis: Day 2: The cash panic that reveals the depths of a nation's despair: Fear is driving a silent bank run - but some see the government's austerity plans as a chance to transform Greek society forever: - Correction Appended</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In one of the biggest banks in the centre of Athens a clerk is explaining how his savers have been thronging to pull out their cash.</p>
      <p>Wary of giving his name, he glances around the marble-floored, wood-panelled foyer before pulling out a slim A4-sized folder. It is about the size of a small safety-deposit box - and those, ever since the financial crisis hit Greece 18 months ago, have become the most sought-after financial products in the country. Worried about whether the banks will stay in business, Greeks have been taking their life savings out of accounts and sticking them in metal slits in basement vaults.</p>
      <p>The boxes are so popular that the bank has doubled the rent on them in the past year - and still every day between five and 10 customers request one. This bank ran out of spares months ago. The clerk leans over: "I've been working in a bank for 31 years, and I've never seen a panic like this."</p>
      <p>Official figures back him up. In May alone, almost euros 5bn (£4.4bn) was pulled out of Greek deposits, as part of what analysts describe as a "silent bank run". This version is also disorderly and jittery, just not as obvious. Customers do not form long queues outside branches, they simply squirrel out as much as they can. Some of that money will have been used to pay debts or supplement incomes, but bankers put the sheer volume of withdrawals down to a general fear about the outlook for Greece, one that runs all the way from the humble rainy-day saver to the really big money.</p>
      <p>'Clueless' government</p>
      <p>"Every time the markets move, I get phone calls," says an Athens-based fund manager. "They're from investors asking: 'How can I get my money out of the country?' "</p>
      <p>One senior investment banker is more blunt: "People are scared that the government doesn't know what the fuck it's doing." He tells a story about an acquaintance who took out euros 30,000, wrapped it in a bag and stashed it in his garage. "The bag had previously had some food inside," he says. "So it attracted rats, who ate the notes."</p>
      <p>Bags of money in garages, frightened savers fleeing banks and even the country: these aren't the sort of stories you associate with a comparatively-prosperous European country, but with a developing one facing a life-or-death economic crash. The fact that they are now emerging from Greece not only indicates the scale of financial distress, it suggests something else: Greece today looks like parts of Latin America in the worst moments of its financial crisis.</p>
      <p>In an echo of the days of Jim Callaghan, the International Monetary Fund is back in Europe, doing what it is more accustomed to doing in Buenos Aires or Brasilia: making emergency loans and telling the government how to run its economy. What is more, the scale of the changes an overborrowed Athens is now making are so vast and so rapid that they will leave Greece looking like a different country.</p>
      <p>The government itself describes its plan to slash public spending and jack up taxes as one of the most ambitious deficit-reduction programmes in the world. But what often goes missing from this discussion of a fiscal crash-landing is the impact on the lives of citizens who have precious little time to adjust. When salaries of civil servants are slashed by up to 30% within a few months, as happened last year, and over 20% of public-sector workers face unemployment within the next four years - plus whole swathes of national assets are to be privatised before Christmas, with more job losses doubtless to follow - then you are talking about a wholesale transformation of a workforce.</p>
      <p>Greece is already one of the poorest and most unequal societies in Europe, reckons Christos Papatheodorou at the Democritus University of Thrace. Among the few countries that look worse are Romania, Bulgaria and Latvia. So what will Greek society look like after the austerity measures take effect? He pauses, then says: "It will probably look like a developing country."</p>
      <p>That message has not been lost on workers either: one of the new nouns used by trade union members and others who oppose the cuts is kinezopeisi, or China-isation. The claim is that such large drops in wages will lead to a workforce paid barely more than their counterparts in Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>The oddest thing of all is that some of the leading lights in the government appear to see nothing wrong in a wholesale transformation of Greek society, albeit not into one that resembles an enterprise zone in eastern China. Elena Panaritis is widely tipped as one of the up and comers in Greece's government, and it is not hard to see why: smart, formidably well-trained in economics after a career with the World Bank, funny and fluent in English, she is exactly the sort of person any prime minister would choose to give a keynote address to fretful institutional investors.</p>
      <p>And for a Greek politician involved in pushing through some of the most abruptly painful economic measures in the country's history, she does not seem especially Greek. When I observe how many Apple computers are in her office, she replies: "That's because I'm not Greek, I'm American." Her speech is American-accented and peppered with "darn" and "have a nice day". When asked to describe how Greece needs to change its economy, her answer revolves around changing its institutions and its structures - in other words, making Greece less Greek. Castigating the bureaucracy, she says: "It's not a kibbutz, it's a big country!"</p>
      <p>This is a line that you hear often enough from those who want Greece to change. By European standards, Greece has an average-sized public sector, but a very leaky tax collection system. What the public sector is, however, is under-resourced and inefficient. On my last day in the country, I wangle my way inside a public pensions office for those working in the tourism industry: there are just two Dell computers in one large room, and lever-arch files dating back 30 years. No one ever paid for the data to be computerised, I am told, and the result is that one day's work takes three.</p>
      <p>Private sector woes</p>
      <p>The other big problem is in the private sector, with few industries that are able to pay their way in the world. Jason Manolopolous, who is author of Greece's 'Odious' Debt, says that for years Greece was buying more from the rest of the world than it was selling. "We were buying BMWs from the Germans and selling them tomatoes."</p>
      <p>For now, those days are well and truly over. In Athens' upmarket shopping district of Kolonaki, boutiques that used to have waiting lists for designer handbags have shut. One sign says the owners have relocated - to Rome. In one clothes shop, with racks of discounted Calvin Klein and DKNY, the manager, Sav, explains what's happened: "In this crisis, the middle classes have been hollowed out." That is just what happened in Buenos Aires during its crash last decade.</p>
      <p>The result is that people who thought themselves used to one way of life, and in one social class, are getting used to a sharp downgrade.</p>
      <p>In one factory, where a staff of 200 is now down to 30, the manager points to empty floors and idle machines. They're now all on unemployment benefit, he says. "Mind you, our pay has been cut too, so we're not that far off."</p>
      <p>Outside the soup kitchen of the Aghia Triada church in Piraeus, near Athens, more of Greece's new poor are waiting for a handout. Anna and her two daughters have walked in the midday sun to get here and are now queueing up with the long-term homeless.</p>
      <p>That is not Anna's situation though; she lost her job three years ago but has still hung on to her house. That said, she no longer has the income or the benefits to pay bills and the electricity was cut off last month.</p>
      <p>Inside, Pater Daniel, the head priest, says that he's noticed a lot more "well-dressed, clean" people taking free meals from the church. He reels off stories of a 23-year-old man who left last week for Australia, and a 40-year-old woman who lost her job on Friday.</p>
      <p>Because the Greek Orthodox church is partly on the state payroll, the clergyman's salary has fallen by almost 10% to euros 15,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Is he saying that the Orthodox church is also subject to public spending cuts? Pater Daniel laughs, then holds up five fingers: there are five priests in Piraeus, and soon there will only be one. He's pondering taking a second job.</p>
      <p>"There is too much pain, and people are looking for someone to listen and squeeze their hand." He sighs. "Everyday I leave this church with a headache."</p>
      <p>Captions:</p>

      <p>Correction</p>
      <p>In an article about the Greek debt crisis, Elena Panaritis, a member of the Greek government, was quoted as replying - in answer to a question about why her office sported so many Apple computers - "That's because I'm not Greek, I'm American". Ms Panaritis was evidently using a figure of speech to describe influences on her life, as she made clear in a later unpublished remark noted during the interview: "I was born here (Greece) but I am one of the diaspora." For the avoidance of doubt: as a parliamentarian she is, by definition, a Greek citizen; the constitution requires this (The cash panic that reveals the depths of a nation's despair, 2 August, page 18).</p>

      <title>G2: Arts: Confessions of a late starter: She failed all her art-school exams, joined a band and didn't get going until she was in her 40s. Now Elizabeth Price has won the Turner prize. She talks to Charlotte Higgins about the long game</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Winning the Turner prize can take a person in all kinds of ways: artists can be bashful, weepy, overcome, euphoric, or any variation thereof. On Monday night, when 46-year-old Elizabeth Price was handed the cheque, it was a notably composed woman who gave her acceptance speech: she thanked her fellow shortlisted artists; paid delicate tribute to Michael Stanley, the Turner prize judge and director of Modern Art Oxford who died this autumn; and, finally, launched into an impassioned critique of the Ebacc, the proposed certificate at 16 for school pupils who have passed GCSEs in five subject areas - the arts not among them.</p>
      <p>When we speak the following morning the artist, who won the prize for her powerful, allusive video work, is equally eloquent on what she regards as the urgent politics of the arts. She says of the previous evening's moment on the podium, "I felt very grave and unelated, and serious, and focused." Her career, she says, would have been impossible without the "generous opportunities I've had through education and public funding". She sees a triple blow: the introduction of the Ebacc; the removal of state funding for the arts in universities; and the reduction of the arts budget - with more cuts feared. "What's depressing about the Ebacc is not only that it will be difficult for individuals to fulfil their ambitions, or get to identify their capabilities and shape their lives around them. But also what you end up with is art becoming something that is available only to privileged people, and expressive only of that experience. That's also what's so damaging about the withdrawal of state funding for humanities and arts at universities: these will become the subjects of the privileged, and history-writing and novel-writing and art-making and poetry-writing will become homogeneous."</p>
      <p>Price is not one of those artists who has made a fortune, or even much of a living, from her work. She teaches a couple of days a week ("that's how I pay the bills"), and for many years "scrapped around" for jobs. It wasn't until she was in her 40s that her career took off. Even five years ago, she says, "the idea that I would be nominated for the Turner prize was just absurd, preposterous. Completely off the map."</p>
      <p>Until then, she had been working in a tradition of pop-inflected conceptual art. But there was something missing. The work felt "too polite, too nervous". She remembers looking at it and thinking: "It's not like I am. It's not pissed off about things. The jokes aren't the jokes I find funny. It's too self-conscious and not direct enough and not candid enough." She considered dropping the whole thing, giving up art: she would mentally scroll through alternative careers, like social work. Then she started making video, and with the first piece, called A Public Lecture and Exhumation, which combined a sort of documentary-style text with images, she felt completely "emancipated". The work ventriloquised the kind of language used by local-authority committees - a language she knew very well: for six years she worked as a part-time administrator for Hackney Council in London. She was a pretty bad administrator, she says, but she learned a lot.</p>
      <p>The work on display now at Tate Britain, The Woolworths Choir of 1979, takes three apparently disparate elements: church architecture; the 1960s girl band the Shangri-Las; and the fire that killed 10 people in the central Manchester branch of Woolworths. The choir of a church is a place of assembly and singing, which takes us to the 1960s pop music; and all three elements are connected by a curious twisted-arm gesture - a girl's arm waving from the burning store; the choreographed dance movements of the pop singers; the arms of figures on medieval funerary monuments. An apparently authoritative, documentary-style text accompanies the images. The piece's power is impossible to articulate in writing, but there is something in its poetic confidence that is completely compelling.</p>
      <p>Not bad, in fact, for someone who did "disastrously" in her first year at art school, and "failed all my exams". That was at the Ruskin School of Drawing at Oxford University in the mid-1980s, where she now teaches. At first, she says, she was lonely and "a bit chippy". She came without the ready-made social circle that she saw those from grander schools bring; she had been to a Luton comprehensive, which she praises. "Anyone could be in the orchestra, or sports team, or arts club at my school. It was precisely the kind of inclusivity that now meets with a sort of scorn and derision as a prizes-for-all culture that generates only mediocrity. There's something so insulting about the idea that including lots of people means mediocrity." She met Amelia Fletcher, now a prominent economist: the two would go on to form the successful indie band Talulah Gosh. Price left the band in the end - she hated being on stage, she said. But the group meant she had "friends and a social life"; and then her art and everything else went better, too.</p>
      <p>Working in video means she can finally bring music back into her work. "I have a pretty expanded view of what art is. I include pop music and even some sports," she says. What sports, I wonder? "Well - football and cricket," she says. "Part of what makes them enjoyable is the culture, the language. I used to listen to the cricket in my studio. I have never played cricket, I have no idea what the rules are, but I enjoyed the terminology."</p>
      <p>There have been 28 winners of the Turner prize, but Price is only the fifth woman. Why? "Because it's difficult to have a career as an artist, and in every situation where it's difficult to have a career, it's even harder for women, for all the other reasons that it's harder in other fiercely contested fields. For women who have children, the economic difficulty of sustaining a life as an artist maybe makes it impossible. There's no maternity leave, there's no pension." Price has no children, but she does have a big family of proud siblings who gathered at Monday's prize ceremony. The award has, she says, involved her not-especially-arty parents in "this slightly cranky thing that I did" - an experience that has been "completely unexpected and very pleasurable".</p>
      <p>In the end, though, we are back to politics. Price is hugely concerned about the government's position on the arts: "It doesn't even look very thought-through. It looks like an ideologically driven set of prejudices." What she is also clear on, is that her career - moulded as it has been by a comprehensive and free university education, and supported by public funding for the arts - "would be impossible now. And the Ebacc is part of that."</p>

      <title>Travel: The Big Trip: Here be dragons: Trekking in Bhutan, Gemma Bowes finds a spectacular, unspoilt country steeped in ancient traditions - and a 'history' as tall as the Himalayas: Way to go: The Pa Chhu is thunderous, milky emerald, and swarming with dragonflies and butterflies</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Near the top of an acclimatisation hike to Bhutan's most famous attraction, Taktshang Goemba, the tigress's nest monastery 900m above Paro valley, I got my first taste of our guide Rinzin Dorje's particular way of imparting Bhutanese history. "The monastery was built by Guru Rinpoche," he said, pointing ahead along the stony path to the tiered temple of red and gold clinging to the cliff-side, "he flew here on the back of his mistress, who had turned herself into a tigress."</p>
      <p>Like the tigress and monk, one of the many mythical figures worshipped in devoutly Buddhist Bhutan, we too had arrived on an incredible flight, eastwards along the Himalayas from Delhi in a plane painted with dragons, passing nine of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Everest. Everest! One minute you're nibbling peanuts and doing ankle exercises and then, right there in your little window is the huge and terrifying peak where, for almost 100 years, climbers have lost their lives in pursuit of the highest frontier.</p>
      <p>The notion that Bhutan is a fairytale, mystical kingdom unchanged by and isolated from the modern world, appeared to be true even at Paro airport, which looks like a temple and displayed a banner saying: "Welcome to the Land of the Thunder Dragon."</p>
      <p>This land that famously measures Gross National Happiness, where mystical Buddhism thrives, archery is the national sport, smoking is illegal, and almost everyone wears national dress, is top of many travellers' wish-lists, yet is tricky to visit.</p>
      <p>Only travellers on packages booked through tour operators are allowed visas, so independent tourists and backpackers can't get in, plus there's the infamous tourist tax of $250 to $280 a day, though in fact most of that goes towards accommodation, transfers, guiding etc, and is included in package prices.</p>
      <p>Discounting 51,910 Indians - who can drive over the border and don't need visas - only 53,504 foreign tourists visited Bhutan in 2012.</p>
      <p>Though unwilling to change its high-value, low-volume model, the Bhutanese government - a new democracy created in 2008 by the modernising king - now says it wants tourism growth. At the end of last year, three new airports were built, providing links to regions such as the tropical east, previously only accessible by several days' difficult driving, though problems mean they rarely operate. Bhutan has always been isolated - the first roads were built in the 1960s, the first tourists arrived in 1974 - but its rulers are ready to embrace the outside world, a little, just not at the expense of its culture and traditions.</p>
      <p>Cultural tours of the spectacular dzong monasteries, temples and festivals is what 90% of visitors book, but it's a bit of a tourist conveyor belt, and once you've seen a few, the best way to escape and experience more of the real Bhutan is on a trek. There are a dozen or so to choose from, but the Jomolhari circuit, or Yaksa trek, a nine-day loop through spectacular mountain scenery, is one of the most popular, challenging without involving 25 days in snow (the Snowman trek), or being too easy (the Druk path).</p>
      <p>Rinzin, smartly dressed in his red-checked gho, long socks, and walking boots, introduced our team: Thinley Namgyal the horseman, Sherab the cook, and Tenzin the cook's assistant, who were busily loading three horses with sacks of food, tents, cooking gas and our own bulging backpacks at the start of the path, 10 minutes' drive from Paro, beside small Drukgyal Dzong.</p>
      <p>Unlike trekking regions in Nepal or Ladakh, Bhutan has no infrastructure to support independent travellers so you must travel with a support team. I found this slightly embarrassing but, as Rinzin said: "If it wasn't this, men would use their horses for smuggling from Tibet. The border is just a day's walk that way," and he gestured up at the grey-white peaks encircling the green farming valley where we began.</p>
      <p>The Pa Chhu river, thunderous, milky emerald, and swarming with dragonflies and butterflies, led our way towards the high mountains across turnip fields and rice paddies.</p>
      <p>At the village of Mesizam, Rinzin explained why most Bhutanese houses are painted with giant erect penises, alongside tigers, monkeys and lotus flowers: "The Divine Madman was a Buddhist saint who came from Tibet, hundreds of years ago, and made many miracles. Once some demons wanted to eat an old lady, but the Divine Madman went to her home first, and told them, 'put your mouths at the hole in the door and I will feed you'. But he tricked them and hit them in the mouth with his penis, his magical thunderbolt! So we paint them, to stop demons."</p>
      <p>Later, at the river's edge, a family had piled stones to form a traditional hot stone bath, and diverted in water into which they dropped sizzling rocks heated on a fire. We were jealous of their wonderful-looking soak, especially with an impending eight days of wet wipes and rough camping.</p>
      <p>After our first camp at Shana Yekha, at 2,898m we entered a forest of pink birch, peeling like sunburned skin, and climbed through Daphne bushes, maples, poplars, bamboo and rhododendron, which cover entire hillsides in colour in spring. Bulbuls, snow pigeons and laughing thrushes flew by, and we crossed little suspension bridges under strings of prayer flags, passing small waterfalls, lagoons the colour of expensive infinity pools, and roughly built stupa and mani walls, carved with Buddhist mantras.</p>
      <p>It was an idyllic route, but soon the experience became less about the landscapes and the pleasant strain of the uphill hike, than about the fantastical stories of local deities, demons and mystical Buddhist beliefs with which Rinzin peppered our walk.</p>
      <p>Even serious Bhutanese history involved reincarnations, flying and levitating lamas (Buddhist leaders), and magical transformations, indistinguishable from religion and myth. In return, Rinzin had a few questions for us.</p>
      <p>"I want to ask you something," he said one day. "I have heard people say that in some western country, Australia or somewhere, they have put a man onto the moon. Have you heard this? I know it cannot be true, it is too unbelievable!"</p>
      <p>We passed stones engraved with "3,000m", then "3,500m" and the snowy Drake range, then Jomolhari, 7,326m high, came into view. Icicles formed now where the river splashed the rocks. In a forest of silver birch hung with wispy old man's beard, Rinzin threw pebbles at yaks to stop them charging, and then we hiked higher onto the barren plains beneath the peaks.</p>
      <p>Each night, camping became colder. Trek routine was to arrive at camp by three or four, eat hot fresh salted popcorn or cake with tea outside until sunset at around five. Wash, read with headtorches in our tent and nap until 6.30pm, eat in the freezing dining tent, talking to Rinzin (the rest of the crew were very separate and never spoke to us, even when we gave gifts of whisky and chocolate). Fall asleep at 9pm. Two layers of thermals, wool top, two fleeces, a huge down jacket, fleece hat, two pairs of gloves, Arctic sleeping bag and hot water bottle were necessary until the middle of the night, when I was warm enough to remove the down jacket. At around 6.30am, Tenzin's gentle call of "bed tea!" woke us and steaming mugs were passed through the zip of our tent, the inside of which was covered in sparkling ice crystals.</p>
      <p>The nights were hard but we loved the adventure of it. And every day was sunny enough for T-shirts. We walked for a few hours then Tenzin, who walked alone, caught us up with our lunch, unpacking stacked tiffin dishes of tasty meat and vegetable stews, mild curries, rice and fresh fruit.</p>
      <p>Though we were in a remote area, and saw no other trekkers bar a group of three Americans who always camped at a different site, there was a steady stream of smugglers and locals walking between isolated villages. In one, Dam Ngo Shong, we were invited in for tea by Nima, Rinzin's friend.</p>
      <p>Piles of fabric, yak-hair ropes, horse blankets, rusty tools, arrows and an old wooden butter churn packed two back rooms to the rafters, and from those rafters hung strings of gnarly yak cheese resembling soap on a rope, and slivers of dried yak meat - even Buddhists can eat animals that died by accident. The biggest room was the altar room, painted bright turquoise, and empty but for Buddhist statues and pictures, rugs and red chillies drying on the window sill.</p>
      <p>We sat on wooden stools in the dark kitchen, eating rice snacks toasted by Nima's teenage daughter. Pictures of Bhutanese kings covered the wall, and diagrams of a strange rare fungus that grows on the root of certain plants in these high altitude areas. A decade ago, life changed dramatically for yak herders such as this family, as a changed law allowed them suddenly to harvest this "caterpillar fungus", a valuable ingredient in Chinese medicine, which fetches £10,000 per kilo. Many yak herders have made a fortune selling it, and Rinzin told us about farmers carrying sacks of money to the bank.</p>
      <p>But despite new wealth, traditional life continues. Astrologers and mystics are usually consulted about illness, - believed to be caused by bad spirits - before western-style doctors, though healthcare is free for all. Marriages in remote villages still often result from a dodgy sounding tradition, nighthunting, in which a young man sneaks through a girl's window in her family home in the middle of the night, wakes her up by whispering in her ear and tries to get her to talk to him, or more, all night.</p>
      <p>"If the girl shares a room with her sisters," Rinzin giggled, "you have to remember what jewellery she wore and what her hair was like, so you can feel them and find the right one. And sometimes they scream for their parents!"</p>
      <p>We camped for two nights at Jomolhari base camp, a flat grassy space with an old ruined dzong on a hill in the foreground, beneath the colossal glacial mountain, and its beautiful neighbour Jitchu Drake. Mountaineering to the summit of any peak is banned in Bhutan, because deities are believed to live there, but we hiked as high as we could to Jomolhari, spotting blue sheep, Himalayan rhubarb, griffon vultures and golden eagles, and, struggling to breathe, reached 4,895m - higher than Mont Blanc.</p>
      <p>The next four days took in more spectacular landscapes. The turquoise Tsho Phu lakes, scree slopes and frozen river crossings; the high passes of Bonte La (4,890m) and Tagulun Lung La, where we hung prayer flags and shouted the customary celebration: "Lha gyal lo!" (may the gods prevail). Rows of Himalayan peaks spread like teeth to the horizon, and we could even see Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain. On the ground, we found curious woolly bundles, the dung of snow leopards, and we camped on an amazing vast plateau, Thangbue, an eastern wild west at 4,120m.</p>
      <p>Eventually, a gruelling trudge down a steep dusty gulley of a path brought us back to the Paro valley, for our final night, celebrated with two Druk 11000 beers. We were exhausted, a bit ill, and desperate to head off to try the posh spa version of a hot stone bath at our next accommodation, the luxurious Uma Paro lodge, and enjoy cosy meals and archery sessions in the pine forest. But I also felt overwhelmed with affection for our kind, funny, fascinating guide, and didn't want the trek to end. When I thanked him for his stories he said he feared they'd soon be lost. "My great grandparents taught them to me, but the stories aren't written down anywhere. I try to pass them on but young kids today aren't interested." Yet Bhutan only got TV in 1999, modernity is slow to come.</p>
      <p>After Paro we drove east to see Thimpu, then to Punakha, in a lush tropical valley, to relax and recover at Uma Paro's new sister hotel, Uma Punkha, a Balinese-style lodge overlooking the Mo Chhu river. We visited the stupendous Punakha dzong, full of gold Buddhas and red-robed monks, and also a fertility temple devoted to the Divine Madman. Inside its dark inner temple, a young couple had brought their new born baby to be named, both first name and second name, in the traditional way, by the chief monk. It would be called Kinley, after the Divine Madman. Even for the very newest generation, the old culture is a powerful living force.</p>
      <p>The trek was provided by Blue Poppy (020-7609 2029, bluepoppybhutan.com), a Bhutan specialist. A 10-day Yaksa trek trip costs from £1,600pp including guiding, tourist taxes, food, Paro accommodation and transfers.</p>
      <p>Virgin Atlantic (0844 209 7777, virginatlantic.com) provided flights from London to Delhi; from £640 return. Flights from Delhi to Paro with Druk Air (drukair.co.bt ) cost around £530 return. Uma Paro (comohotels.com) has rooms from $300 a night; Uma Punakha from $400.

      <subject>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</subject>
      <title>Weekend: Living: Food: Less is more: The secret of good cooking has a lot to do with knowing when to leave well alone. Jeremy Lee kicks off an occasional series to show that often, the fewer the ingredients, the better the dish</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>'Six?!" I said, incredulously. "Six," he said, emphatically. "Sounds dangerously populist, if you don't mind my saying so."</p>
      <p>"Six."</p>
      <p>In spite of my protests, a meal consisting of three courses made up of dishes with no more than six ingredients each (although, none too generously, I was allowed not to count basics such as oils and seasoning in that number) was firmly on the agenda. My initial thoughts on this theme are pretty unprintable - after all, that number has more in common with the hairline of a child of the devil than good grub.</p>
      <p>Sure, great food is little more than a simple matter of good ingredients cooked well - inventive thought, quirk and novelty are best left in the hands of toy manufacturers - but the creation of teeny-weeny recipes that are supposed to have the cook in the kitchen for just 10 minutes yet still be able to produce a dinner that will knock your socks off are on the whole, and in the politest terms, a complete nonsense. Or so I huffed.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are some grand dishes with scant ingredients that do require only the minimum of preparation. A risotto of leeks, even using a stock cube, that hated lump of poison, takes 35-40 minutes to bring to fruition. Omelettes, on the other hand, are quick, yet curiously absent from daily life; the fact that they require a skill achieved through plenty of practice appears unworthy of mention - some chopped herbs, a little truffle, smoked haddock even, simply and elegantly accompany this greatly neglected dish.</p>
      <p>A little more thought can bring to mind other great dishes that require few ingredients and not much more effort than bending down at the oven now and again. To pop a roast in the oven requires little more than a good butcher and skill in timing. Liberal seasoning with sea salt and freshly ground pepper are all that is required, along with some roast potatoes, perhaps, and a salad. Hamburgers, likewise, spring to mind as a possibility, as do watercress soup, moules marinieres and fried fish . . .</p>
      <p>Gosh, now I come to think about it, there are loads of lovely dishes, all with six ingredients or fewer. So, to start, I think we'll have some prawns, not least because there is much satisfaction in peeling them and then leaving them to steep in bread and oil and a little garlic. That's it, more or less - all that's left is to skewer and grill them. Quite delicious, and delightfully free of quirk.</p>
      <p>It is an oddity that those countries, such as France or Italy, with many a grand cooking tradition also have a surfeit of sublimely simple one-course meals that may consist of nothing more than a few thin slices of cured meats, a bowl of olives, some bread and a bottle of wine; some cheese and fruit may feature, also, if you're going to push the boat out. Then again, in those countries you can, generally, buy very good stuff for such a feast, but it is difficult to pay dear old Blighty the same compliment, not least because the survival rates of a good butcher continue to plummet dramatically.</p>
      <p>That said, spare ribs do seem to be something of a constant, here, although they are generally reserved for a severe charring on a savage barbecue. When treated with a degree of respect, however, they become notable. And when made with the ribs of a superior breed of pig or cow, they are great. To accompany them, some mashed potatoes flavoured with Parmesan, which speak for themselves, and a salad, if desired.</p>
      <p>And for pudding? Oranges in a caramel-flavoured syrup are a refreshing and delicious finish, as well as simplicity itself to prepare.</p>
      <p>Such a meal makes a convincing argument for the delights of the simple approach. In this case, less is certainly more. As ever, the secret - how often do I say this? - lies in the quality of the raw materials. Even when they number only six, ingredients of top quality require minimum handling and embellishment, so long as this is done in a sympathetic manner. The results are revelatory - to me, at any rate.</p>
      <p>All recipes serve six.</p>
      <p>GRILLED PRAWN SKEWERS</p>
      <p>A great recipe from the great Marcella Hazan. The end result is a testament to keeping it simple.</p>
      <p>900g plump prawns</p>
      <p>31/2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</p>
      <p>31/2 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
      <p>75g fine, white breadcrumbs</p>
      <p>2 cloves garlic, chopped very fine</p>
      <p>2 tsp flat-leaf parsley, picked and chopped very fine</p>
      <p>Sea salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>Shell the prawns, but leave their tails on. With a small, sharp knife, remove the dark vein that runs along their backs. Wash the tails in cold water and then pat dry with a tea towel. Put the cleaned, prepared prawns in a roomy bowl.</p>
      <p>Add as much of the olive oil and vegetable oil, in equal parts, and the breadcrumbs as you need to coat them evenly but lightly all over - you may not require all of the oil and breadcrumbs indicated in the ingredient list, but if you have a large number of very small prawns you may need more of each (in which case, ensure that you use olive and vegetable oil in equal quantities).</p>
      <p>Add the garlic, parsley, salt and pepper to the bowl, and toss thoroughly. Allow the prawns to steep in their coating for at least half an hour, and preferably for two hours.</p>
      <p>Heat a ridged griddle pan. Skewer the prawns tightly (on toothpicks, say) curling one end inwards and pushing the skewer through at three points, which will prevent the prawns from slipping from the skewer when you turn them. Cook the prawns briefly on the griddle, about two minutes, depending on their size and the intensity of the heat, turning frequently.</p>
      <p>SPARE RIBS ROASTED WITH SAGE AND WHITE WINE, TREVISO-STYLE If you've been reduced to poverty and misery after the wanton indulgence of the December bender, this marvellous dish from Marcella Hazan (yes, her again, but you can never have too much of a good thing) soothes and satisfies. Serve with the Parmesan mash below.</p>
      <p>4 tbsp vegetable oil</p>
      <p>1.35kg rack spare ribs, divided into single ribs</p>
      <p>3 cloves garlic, peeled and cut into thin slices</p>
      <p>2 tbsp fresh sage, chopped</p>
      <p>250ml dry white wine</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>Take a heavy-bottomed pan large enough to accommodate all the ribs without crowding them. Put in the oil and turn the heat to medium-high. When the oil is hot, put in the ribs, and turn them as they cook until they are browned all over.</p>
      <p>Add the garlic and sage, and as soon as the garlic turns a very pale blond add the wine. After the wine has simmered briskly for 15-20 seconds, reduce the heat to a simmer, then add salt and pepper and cover the pan with the lid slightly askew. Cook for about 40 minutes, turning the ribs from time to time, until their fleshiest part feels very tender when prodded with a fork and comes easily away from the bone. If the liquid in the pan looks like evaporating entirely, which is likely, add a couple of tablespoons of water from time to time, to keep the ribs moist.</p>
      <p>Transfer the cooked ribs to a warm serving platter using a slotted spoon or spatula. Tip the pan and spoon off about a third of the liquefied pork fat. Leave more than you usually would when degreasing a pan, because you'll need it to season the Parmesan mash.</p>
      <p>Add 100ml water to the pan and raise the heat, scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to dislodge any cooking residues stuck there. Pour the resulting dark, dense juices over the ribs and serve at once.</p>
      <p>MASHED POTATOES BOLOGNESE-STYLE, WITH MILK AND PARMESAN</p>
      <p>500g best mashing potatoes (Maris Piper, or somesuch)</p>
      <p>50g unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</p>
      <p>6 tbsp Parmesan, freshly grated</p>
      <p>Sea salt</p>
      <p>Nutmeg</p>
      <p>100ml whole milk</p>
      <p>Scrub the potatoes clean (do not peel them), and put them in a large pot of salted water. Bring to the boil and simmer until cooked through. Do not pierce the potatoes too often, as the skin may break. Drain and peel while still hot.</p>
      <p>Place a pan of water on a moderate heat and set a heatproof bowl over it. Put the butter in the bowl, then put the potatoes through a mouli, or mash them, and mix with the melting butter. In another pan, warm the milk, ensuring that it does not boil. Begin beating the potatoes, adding a little milk at a time, then mix in the cheese and any extra milk, if required. Add salt and a little grated nutmeg, and serve immediately.</p>
      <p>CARAMELISED ORANGES</p>
      <p>In honour of oranges being so good at this time of year. This most simple of desserts is delicious and refreshing.</p>
      <p>12 oranges</p>
      <p>320g caster sugar</p>
      <p>150ml cold water</p>
      <p>Grand Marnier</p>
      <p>Pare the rind from six of the oranges and cut it into very thin strips. Place a small pan of water on to boil, drop in the prepared rind, simmer for a minute, then drain under cold running water. Peel the remaining oranges, discarding the pith, and slice the flesh of all 12 oranges into segments. Remove any pips, then rearrange the fruit into their original orange shape, securing them with cocktail sticks. Put the oranges into a handsome serving bowl.</p>
      <p>Put the sugar in a heavy-bottomed pot and pour in just enough water in which to dissolve it. Over a moderate heat, melt the sugar, stirring all the while, until it forms a syrup, and continue cooking, stirring all the while, until the syrup becomes a rich dark caramel. Cover your hand and forearm with a cloth, to avoid painful splashes, and pour the 150ml of cold water into the pan, averting your face as you do so: the hot caramel will react very violently. Simmer until all the caramel has melted, and then add a generous splash of Grand Marnier. Pour the syrup over the oranges and, when the syrup has cooled down, sprinkle over the blanched rind, cover and refrigerate. Serve chilled</p>

      <title>Why are there so few women in tech? The truth behind the Google memo</title>
      <subtitle>An engineer at the company has suggested male domination of Silicon Valley is down to biological differences between the sexes. But the root causes are much more complicated</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is time to be "open about the science of human nature". This was the assertion of software engineer James Damore to his colleagues at Google, in an internal memo that has since led to his sacking. "I'm simply stating," Damore wrote, "that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership." He went on to imply that women's "stronger interest in people" and "neuroticism" might make them less naturally suited to being coders at Google.</p>
      <p>The company's leadership viewed the matter differently, firing Damore and sparing his female colleagues the need to prove their biological aptitude for working with computers.</p>
      <p>Sacking one errant employee doesn't alter an awkward fact, though. Only 20% of Google engineers are women - a statistic that is matched roughly across big tech companies. So, does Damore have a point? Is there an underlying biological explanation for why so few women work at a company that prides itself on its progressive ideals and family-friendly ethos?</p>
      <p>There are countless scientific studies that claim to identify differences between male and female cognitive aptitudes and, in the UK, far fewer girls choose to study computer science at GCSE level (20% of the total number of students), at degree level (16%) and beyond. There is something seductive about the idea that professional success springs from our innate abilities, rather than the degree to which society tips the odds in our favour.</p>
      <p>After the contents of the memo became public, through a leak to tech site Gizmodo, the "scientific" argument for innate biological differences quickly found favour with some tech insiders, albeit those writing anonymously on sites such as Hacker News and the gossip app Blind.</p>
      <p>On Blind - which requires users to prove who they work for before posting - one Google employee wrote: "Can we go back to the time when Silicon Valley were [sic] about nerds and geeks, that's why I applied [to] Google and came to the US. I mean this industry used to be a safe place for people like us, why so fking complicated now." "I used to dislike conservatives until I started working in tech," wrote another. "Now I sympathise with them due to the hostility and groupthink, as well as the fact that they are the only ones standing up for classical liberal values."</p>
      <p>While the biological hypothesis seems to appeal to some tech workers, the notion that Silicon Valley's gender gap can be explained away by such factors is questionable. Prof Dame Wendy Hall, a director of the Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton, points to the wide variation in gender ratios in computing internationally, which she argues would not be seen if there were a universal biological difference in ability between the sexes. While only 16% of computer science undergraduates in the UK - and a similar proportion in the US - are female, the balance is different in India, Malaysia and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>"I walk into a classroom in India and it's more than 50% girls, the same in Malaysia," says Hall. "They are so passionate about coding, Lots of women love coding. There just aren't these gender differences there."</p>
      <p>In fact, in the west, female participation in computer science has plunged since the mid-80s, while female participation in medicine and other scientific fields has increased steadily.</p>
      <p>Over the past decade, even with a number of initiatives being set up to boost girls' participation in coding and computer science, the proportion of female computer science undergraduates has continued to fall - 10 years ago, the proportion was 19% of the UK total.</p>
      <p>Hall believes that the gender gap and the "male computer geek" stereotype can be dated back to the advent of the home computer in the early 80s, when the machines were marketed heavily as gaming systems for men. She suspects this might be more culpable for women's low participation than men having evolved a mindset better suited to writing lines of code.</p>
      <p>"Women were turned off computing in the 80s," she says. "Computers were sold as toys for the boys. Somehow that cultural stigma has stuck in the west in a way that we can't get rid of and it's just getting worse. The skills gap is going to get huge."</p>
      <p>Jane Margolis, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, agrees. Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students in the 90s at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programmes in the country at the time.</p>
      <p>"Many of the women at Carnegie Mellon talked about computers being in [their brother's] bedroom and there were a lot of father-son internships around the computer that weren't happening with the girls," she says. "There was a cultural assumption that the norms of being in computer science were that you would do it 24/7, were obsessed with it, wanted nothing in your life but computers - and that was very much associated with male adolescents," she added. "It was very much based around a male norm. Females were made to think that, if they didn't dream in code and if it wasn't their full obsession, they didn't belong or were not capable of being in the field."</p>
      <p>Prof Gina Rippon, a neuroscientist at Aston University in Birmingham, has studied extensively cognitive differences between men and women. She says that, while Damore pointed to scientific evidence for men and women having different aptitudes and personality traits, he "seemed to miss the point that, even if there were well-established sex differences at any level, they're always very tiny. Certainly not enough to explain the gender ratios of Google programmers - even if you didn't want to get into the nitty-gritty of arguing about the science."</p>
      <p>Rippon's work suggests that, in many cases, the differences between male and female performance, if present, are very small, can disappear with training and are not consistent across cultures.</p>
      <p>In one study, Rippon found that British men performed significantly better on a spatial rotation task than women. However, when the experiment was repeated with Chinese participants, there was no difference between the male and female participants. Other similar studies have found that gender differences in spatial rotation tasks disappeared when the researchers controlled for video game experience. Rippon points to another study, which showed that differences in personality traits between men and women varied wildly across countries, depending on the status of women in that society.</p>
      <p>So, Damore's suggestion that women are "more prone to anxiety" does not imply that this difference is a function of hormones or hardwiring of the brain. Plus, there is compelling evidence that unconscious biases have a powerful effect on what people expect themselves to be good at and how they perform. For instance, girls tend to score worse on a test if they are told their maths skills are being assessed than when they are told they are taking part in a study investigating how people solve problems.</p>
      <p>Even assuming that there are fundamental differences between male and female cognition and personality, there is no clear, logical line between such findings in a laboratory setting and performance in the workplace.</p>
      <p>Priya Guha, the UK lead of tech incubator RocketSpace and a former UK consul general in San Francisco, argues that, even by its own arguments, Damore's memo missed the point. "The description of an engineer as somebody who has their head down, focused on developing the next line of code, is the sort of engineer that won't be adding value," she says. "We need engineers out there who are both very strong developers, but also people who understand the world around them and are comfortable interacting with society. So, by that description, women would be better engineers even by the stereotypes he proposes."</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, many such multiskilled people are likely to be deterred by the perception of hostility engendered by claims like Damore's. "We have a historical challenge to encourage girls, let alone women, into careers such as engineering, which then creates an imbalance in the people who enter tech industries overall," says Guha. "Tech has a particular problem in this area. Wherever there are instances of people creating a hostile environment, companies need to stamp that out quickly. His dismissal sends a really powerful message: the environment in these companies needs to be thought about to ensure that it improves day by day."</p>
      <p>But Eileen Burbidge, a partner at venture capital firm Passion Capital, argues that tech does not have a significantly worse gender gap than other high-pressure industries such as finance or the media. "I think it comes down to cultural norms and female representation in general," Burbidge says. "It is what affects the rest of the business world: it's around the same time that women start thinking about having families that they think about the opportunity cost of staying in a work environment, and if it's not positive or they get negative influences it's going to affect their decisions."</p>
      <p>She argues that, in many ways, tech is better placed than most large industries to tackle its gender gaps. "I don't think there's anything specific that needs to be done for technology: I think the tech sector is more introspective and likes to think of itself as more progressive, so remedies that work for other sectors will help here, too," she says.</p>
      <p>"In Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] in particular, we're seeing the tech industry trying to be more proactive about outreach. The industry is trying to have this discussion a lot - companies don't always follow what they say, but they say it, at least."</p>
      <p>Peter Daly, an associate in the employment team at the law firm Bindemans, agrees with Burbidge. "The clients I've had from the tech world are pretty evenly split by gender," he says. "But, because it encourages risk-taking, tech doesn't fit well with maternity and pregnancy, so that can be a source of a lot of friction. You see people in the industry who see pregnancy as a genuine problem." That, he says, is the main cause of gender-specific issues in technology - at least, those that reach the stage of requiring a legal recourse.</p>
      <p>Internal documents such as Damore's are the soft end of the sort of hostile working environment female employees can face at overwhelmingly male tech firms. At the extreme end, as companies such as Uber and Tinder have learned, this environment can result in claims of sexual harassment and illegal discrimination.</p>
      <p>At Uber, where 85% of technical employees are male, one engineer, Susan Fowler, wrote a tell-all blogpost that revealed a workplace where managers proposition female employees for sex and human resources does little to stop the issue. Tinder faced a similar scandal when former VP Whitney Wolfe sued the company over "atrocious" misogyny in 2014, entering into evidence abusive texts allegedly sent by Tinder's chairman, Sean Rad.</p>
      <p>Beyond the egregious cases, the wider culture of even the most diverse Silicon Valley firms can still end up being offputting to would-be employees: the campus-style culture, which encourages workers to be on site from dawn till dusk, renders it hard for any primary caregiver to be "part of the team", while in some companies an antipathy for part-time work or on-site creches can also limit flexibility.</p>
      <p>Addressing the gender gap isn't only an issue of perception. Companies with homogenous workforces make worse products and earn less money, argues Guha. "We know large numbers of women are struggling to get funding. A female founder is 86% less likely to be funded than a man," she says. "That's crazy when we know the return on investment is higher; it is about 34% higher for companies with a gender diverse leadership. It's not about 'corporate social responsibility': a diverse range of thinking will bring better value for the company."</p>

      <p>As we move into a future in which algorithms have greater influence on our lives - from communication to healthcare, transport to the law - the gender balance in tech companies goes beyond what is fair for their employees. The result of male domination of tech has led to the development of, for example, voice recognition technologies that, trained and tested solely by men, struggle to understand female voices. It has resulted in virtual reality technologies that disproportionally impose motion sickness on women. At this early moment in its history, the tech industry is already littered with products that have gender bias effectively programmed into them.</p>
      <p>"The most objectionable point about that memo was the notion that there are biological differences that make women less capable," said Burbidge. "Obviously, I have an issue with that and I think it's fundamentally incorrect. The thing I can't answer is how, in 2017, do you stop people thinking that? I don't know how you change people's minds."</p>
      <p>"As we go into the world of AI, when people are designing algorithms that help us live our lives, it will be very bad if that's all done by men," says Hall. "Social care, looking after kids, so many aspects of our lives. We really need as many people as possible doing this. It's really important and it's going to get more important."</p>
      <p>Hall invokes her late mentor Karen Spärck Jones, a pioneering British computer scientist who campaigned hard to encourage more women into the field. As she used to say: "Computing is too important to be left to men."</p>

      <subtitle>Why is Aids an epidemic? Edward Hooper spent years searching for the source, and his book has sparked controversy over claims of human error in vaccination programmes</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In June 1981, two unusual events occurred in very different parts of the world. In Los Angeles, five gay men fell sick with rare symptoms suggestive of immunological problems, which prompted two local doctors to write a paper for the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Meanwhile, in Mugana, northern Tanzania, a German missionary doctor saw five women from the Ugandan border region, all suffering from untreatable anaerobic ulcers of the groin and anus. Some new pathogen was abroad, and these doctors were among the first to recognise that fact.</p>
      <p>Before long, the beast was named. By 1983, the condition of immune collapse had swept through gay communities in the western world, and was given the acronym Aids. Meanwhile, in Africa, the condition spread almost as rapidly among men, women and children. Tanzanian villagers christened the newly -arrived disease 'Juliana' and Ugandans named it 'Slim'. By 1985, it was realised that the US and African outbreaks were caused by the same pathogen. In both cases, it seems, this pathogen, HIV, had been planted in fertile seed -beds (the gay bath-houses of Los Angeles; the smuggling zone around Lake Victoria) and had prospered. But this begged a further question: where had the new virus sprung from?</p>
      <p>The classic view about emerging viruses is that there is an unprecedented interaction between humans and their environment (traveller visits bat cave, logging company opens up virgin rain forest), which triggers a zoonosis - a human disease caused by crossover of an animal pathogen. This scenario seems to work well for killer diseases like Ebola, Marburg and Lassa Fever, and has considerably boosted funds to American virology labs. But does it apply equally well to HIV?</p>
      <p>The disciples of 'natural transfer', such as the microbiologist Beatrice Hahn, from the University of Alabama, and geneticist Paul Sharp, from the University of Nottingham, believe it does. They propose that a hunter or bushmeat- seller who had skinned or butchered a chimpanzee somewhere in west-central Africa became infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and that this gave birth to the HIV variant (HIV-1 Group M) which has now infected more than 50 million persons worldwide, causing 16 million deaths from Aids.</p>
      <p>Two other outbreaks of HIV-1 infection (Groups O and N) have been recognised in the 1990s, and these, they say, arose in the same way. When asked why there have apparently been no Aids outbreaks before the late 20th century, they reply that perhaps there have been, but that it took road-building, urbanisation, and new sexual freedoms following independence, to allow the viruses to break free from sequestered African environments and begin their awful spread.</p>
      <p>This theory of west-central African origin was presented in February 1999, with Hahn adding that a reduction in the chimpanzee bushmeat trade would lessen the chances of future Aids outbreaks. She further claimed (misleadingly) that the local subspecies of chimp was in danger of extinction, which might prevent the development of an effective vaccine. It was a sexy package and it grabbed headlines.</p>
      <p>However, there were some problems with the theory. First, in the slave trade up to the 1860s, more than 10m Africans from the western seaboard were transported to the Americas. Their viruses and retroviruses came too, but apparently no SIVs or HIVs. Furthermore, there were huge internal population movements in Africa - caused by colonial labour recruitment for plantations, mines and the construction of roads and railways - in the early 20th century, while millions of Africans fought in the two world wars. Yet there was not one visible outbreak of Aids.</p>
      <p>Second, although the two minor HIV-1 variants, Group O and Group N, have a clear epidemiological hearth in west-central Africa, the pandemic variant, Group M, does not. There is no evidence of Group M being present there before 1981.</p>
      <p>There is, meanwhile, another HIV, HIV-2, which appears to have descended from the SIV of the sooty mangabey, and which has a hearth in West Africa, especially the tiny state of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
      <p>The American virologist, Preston Marx, carried out extensive research on sooty mangabey SIV and HIV-2 infections in West Africa and he reached a startling conclusion: that sooty mangabey SIV acquired by hunters or bushmeat sellers resulted in non-pathogenic infections that were hardly, if at all, transmissible; 'dead-end infections', in short. Natural transfer, he decided, was not by itself enough to cause Aids.</p>
      <p>Marx felt that an extra factor was needed to turn such viruses into epidemic forms, and he proposed needles - either those reused in poorly-equipped 'country clinics' or those inadequately sterilised during mass vaccination programmes. What Marx was proposing was a natural transfer from sooty mangabeys, followed by an iatrogenic (physician-caused) amplification of the virus in humans.</p>
      <p>So, could the needles hypothesis apply in west-central Africa also, and explain the outbreaks of HIV-1-related Aids?</p>
      <p>The natural transfer school thought it could. In February this year, one of Hahn's colleagues, Bette Korber, addressed a press conference about her research on the dating of the pandemic. She had used a 'super-computer' to compare many different Group M viral sequences, and proposed that the date of the 'last common ancestor' was 1930, plus or minus 20 years. Most reporters interpreted this as a chimp hunter getting infected in west-central Africa in 1930, and Korber did not disavow them.</p>
      <p>When other scientists looked for mass vaccination campaigns in the area, they came up with inoculations against smallpox, yaws, sleeping sickness and yellow fever, starting as long ago as the late 19th century and continuing right through to the present day.</p>
      <p>I believe, however, that this actually weighs against the natural transfer theory, for despite claiming mechanisms for crossover and amplification, Hahn and Korber still cannot provide evidence of Group M infection in west-central Africa before 1981. However, there is considerable evidence further east, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and Burundi, where M-infected blood is seen from the late 1950s onwards, and Group M-related Aids from the early 1970s.</p>
      <p>Hahn and Sharp argue that a chimp hunter from west-central Africa could have travelled here soon after getting infected, and sparked the Group M pandemic. The problem is there are approximately 12 subtypes of Group M, which appear to have emerged in the 1950s. Just how did the itinerant hunter start all these?</p>
      <p>The answer, I believe, is that he did not. I propose a different origin for HIV-1 Group M, pertaining to Chat, an experimental oral polio vaccine (OPV) which, I believe, was prepared in the kidney cells of chimpanzees, nearly 400 of which were sacrificed between 1956 and 1958 at Lindi camp, a vaccine research facility in the then Belgian Congo (now the DRC).</p>
      <p>The primate cells used to produce Chat were never documented at the time and have never since been revealed. But between 1957 and 1960, Chat vaccine was fed to over a million Africans in the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi - and 64% of all the earliest (retrospectively recognised) Aids cases in Africa, through 1980, come from the same places where Chat was fed. So do 82% of the earliest HIV-1 Group M infections, again through 1980. I have documented 28 Chat campaigns in these former Belgian colonies, and the introduction of different chimp SIV variants in different vaccination venues may provide the explanation for the very different Group M subtypes.</p>
      <p>It is only 200 miles from the Ruzizi valley, where the biggest mass trial of Chat was staged in 1958, to northern Tanzania, where the Tanzanian army camped for three months in 1978 before driving Idi Amin from Uganda, and where the first cluster of African Aids cases was seen in 1980. And the only other place where experimental variants of Chat were tested was on babies born at Clinton, a women's prison in New Jersey, which lies just 50 miles from where the first plausible HIV-1 infection in the US was identified.</p>
      <p>My own position has changed somewhat since my book, The River, was published. I now believe that both methods of transfer (natural and iatrogenic, cut hunter and contaminated vaccine) may work. Scientists are now finding 'sputtering forms' of HIV-1 in the Cameroon, variants which are not related to any of the known subtypes and which look suspiciously like those dead-end HIV -2 infections. Increasingly it seems that natural transfers of SIVs from sooty mangabeys and chimps may occasionally take in humans, but that they neither spread easily, nor readily cause Aids.</p>
      <p>But for an Aids epidemic or pandemic to occur, I believe what is needed is a mass exposure, as through a vaccination campaign. Perhaps SIVs stand a better chance of infecting humans when prepared in cell culture, and are then introduced by an 'unnatural' route. Or perhaps it is simply a question of numbers - and only 1 in 10,000 (or 100,000) human exposures to SIV results in a productive infection.</p>
      <p>My bet is that even those smaller outbreaks of HIV-1 Group O and HIV-2 may have been sparked by experimental vaccine trials. In the late 50s', French polio vaccines, prepared in cells from African primates, were tested in the French colonies of west Africa and west-central Africa. The preferred primates were Guinea baboons which, records reveal, were frequently gang-caged with other monkeys, including sooty mangabeys.</p>
      <p>However, scores of chimps were also present in the manufacturing labs for vaccine safety testing, and it may be their kidneys (undamaged by this testing) were later incorporated into the French vaccines - just as I believe happened with the Lindi chimps and Chat vaccine.

      <title>G2: Opening salvoes: It may have had a £40m revamp, but is the Imperial War Museum now as much of a relic as its Spitfires and doodlebugs? As the dustsheets come off its new exhibits, Stephen Moss goes behind the scenes</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>'Imperial, war and museum - the three worst words in the English language." Imperial War Museum director Diane Lees is quoting one of her predecessors, Alan Borg, who reckoned he ran the museum with the most forbidding title in the world. I had asked her why, since she is overseeing the biggest overhaul at the museum for a generation, she didn't drop the word "imperial"; maybe even "war". Anyone for the Museum of Global Conflict? Or maybe Battle Space?</p>
      <p>"We've had that conversation several times," she admits, "and I'm fascinated by the archive of the trustee discussions on that very matter." The museum's peculiar title has, it seems, long been up for debate, but all three words have survived the latest Big Think. "War," says Lees by way of explanation, "is always going to be fascinating to a certain section of the audience, and our job is to broaden that audience. The imperial bit is accepted as a historical fact as opposed to a political agenda. And museums have changed their image - more people now visit museums than attend football matches. The Imperial War Museum is an internationally recognised brand, and any brand consultant will say, 'Throw that out at your peril.'" Battle Space will have to wait.</p>
      <p>The great naval guns outside the museum, which is housed in the old Bethlem Hospital in Southwark, south London, have also survived. They are the first thing you see as you walk into the park that encloses the museum - municipal land over which she has no control, Lees tells me, disowning the down-at-heel cafe near the guns that will sit oddly alongside the three snazzy new cafes being installed as part of the £40m refurb.</p>
      <p>The museum is still a bit of a bomb site when I visit, even though the reopening on 19 July after a year-long refit is only a couple of weeks away. I am allowed to peer at the redesigned atrium from a balcony, a dustsheet being peeled back to reveal a decluttered space with just nine iconic military objects. The Mark 1 Spitfire and V1 and V2 rockets that have always been there have now been joined by a Harrier jump jet, the car mangled in a suicide bombing in Baghdad in 2007 that Jeremy Deller turned into an art installation, and a Reuters Land Rover - symbols of wars in which the UK has been busily engaged over the past 20 years. The Sopwith Camel biplane that used to hang in the atrium has gone into the enlarged first world war galleries, and many of the other objects that used to be in the entrance area have been rehoused or pensioned off.</p>
      <p>Most of the £40m has been spent on opening out the atrium and remodelling the first world war galleries - to coincide with this summer's centenary - but this is only the first phase of redevelopment and refurbs of the floors devoted to the second world war and the world since 1945 are also planned. First world war, second world war, the rest - that is the tripartite narrative adopted by the museum, which, born in 1917 in the shadow of the battle of the Somme, remains essentially a record of the British empire's struggle in the two global conflicts. Nigel Steel, the museum's principal historian, makes no apology for this regimented portrait of the</p>
      <p>past century.</p>
      <p>"The Somme was such an enormous event for the nation that it was felt we had to make a record of it," he says. "The main mover was Sir Alfred Mond, commissioner of works and a cabinet member. When the second world war breaks out, our terms of reference immediately get expanded to cover that as well. Then in 1953, when the Korean war is ended with an armistice, it becomes all of the major wars of the 20th century that Britain and the Commonwealth have been involved in."</p>
      <p>Steel thinks it is inevitable that in this centenary year and with the new galleries it will look as if the first world war is unduly dominant. The million-plus annual visitors and all those curriculum-following school groups mostly come for the sections devoted to the two world wars, and there is a danger that everything else - grouped together on the third level - could get lost. But Steel insists it's all there if visitors are willing to look: Korea, Malaya, the end of empire, the age of the Bomb, the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Iraq, Afghanistan. Quite how you can manage to absorb all that in a visit that averages a couple of hours is, though, a moot point. My guess is visitors will be more inclined to dwell in the new "virtual trench" than head up to the area devoted to asymmetric warfare.</p>
      <p>Why, though, do we need a museum dedicated to British military endeavour? "We are now at a point where the first world war has fallen from living memory," says James Taylor, lead curator on the new first world war galleries, "and it's up to us to give a shape and context to that conflict, which the distance of time allows us to do. We mustn't use the objects as relics but make them speak."</p>
      <p>The museum tries not to express one view of history - the mantra, repeated by everyone I talk to, is that its displays are designed to encourage visitors to think for themselves. There is, for instance, no desire to blame Germany for the first world war, nor to glorify the allies' eventual success. Lees sticks to Mond's original prospectus that the</p>
      <p>museum should record "toil and sacrifice". But it is not possible to be</p>
      <p>entirely opinion-free, and in the great debate sparked off by the centenary over whether the first world war was worth fighting, it is clear where the</p>
      <p>museum stands.</p>
      <p>"The key thing is that Britain makes a conscious choice to go to war when it cannot be said that it is directly threatened, or at least that's how we might see it today," says Taylor. But, he insists, that view relies on hindsight. "At the time, Asquith and his cabinet are thinking, 'Our strategic aims are threatened.' A lot of what people understand about the war has been received through poetry, or Birdsong, or even something like Downton Abbey. It leaves them with a very different view from the one people had at the time. The key words that come up (among visitors) are 'senseless' and 'futile'. We try to show how people saw the war at the time. Visitors always ask, 'With all those casualties, why didn't they stop?' But, if you look at the evidence from the time, that's the very reason people can't stop - you need a justification for such terrible loss and that can only be victory."</p>
      <p>The museum's raison d'etre is to use contemporary objects and testimonies to recreate the world as those living through wars saw it - or see it, in the case of the soldiers in Afghanistan from whom it is currently collecting oral histories. What is on display is only a tiny part of the museum's total collection, which includes 32,000 objects, 10,000 sets of private papers and 750,000 photographs. Borg, who oversaw the last major refurbishment when he was director in the 80s, makes the point that the museum's key work is unseen. "Although the millions of people who go through the galleries are important," he says, "and we hope they go out thinking, it's the documents and film departments which are really vital. The important thing is to have enough money to keep the academic and collecting sides of the museum operating."</p>
      <p>Borg, who later went on to run the V&amp;A, tells me that during his tenure from 1982 to 1995 he sought to humanise the museum. "It seemed to me that, provided we didn't have another immediate world conflict, the role of the museum would have to change as there wouldn't be veterans around," he says, "and the way in which we attempted to change it was to get across the idea that the museum was actually about people. We had lots of large bits of hardware - tanks, aeroplanes and so on - but the real subject is people." This commitment to telling individual stories, he says, chimed with the new passion among the public for unearthing family history, which helped to stop the museum looking like an anachronism.</p>
      <p>Another reason it remains relevant can be found at the very top of the building, in a gallery devoted to contemporary art. The show chosen for the reopening - running alongside an exhibition of first world war art - is a series of films and photographs by Mark Neville, who spent 10 weeks embedded with British troops in Helmand province in Afghanistan in 2010. If anyone doubts that the museum is willing to give space to voices that question war, they should march up here, because, with his slow-motion films shot from a passing tank of bemused or accusing Afghan faces and photographs of desperately youthful British soldiers, Neville is quietly subversive. "What the two films I shot in Bolan market reveal is the deeply complex relationship between us as an occupying force and the locals," he tells me. "You can see that, although some people are smiling, there's a sense of something else going on behind the eyes." He also filmed locals against backdrops of photographs taken by the Irishman John Burke during the second Anglo-Afghan war of the 1870s - a simple and powerful comment on the cyclical nature of war.</p>
      <p>"What's important about Mark's work is how different it is from the journalistic images you see from the war in Afghanistan," says Kathleen Palmer, the museum's head of art. "It will ask questions and won't give easy answers, which is how it should be for contemporary conflicts. Artistic responses to war are an important part of the museum's programming. Artists look at things differently. We can talk about facts in lots of other exhibitions, but this reaches people in a different way."</p>
      <p>Palmer had a hand in acquiring Deller's bomb-mangled car for the museum, and believes the fact it has been chosen as one of the key objects on display in the atrium is significant. "It's not a sculpture, it's an object in the collection now and the artist is very clear about that," she says. "The project we did with Jeremy (in 2010) made us look at how the large objects in the gallery were displayed. Bringing in something that had been destroyed talked about the consequences of war. As well as having big objects that are fully restored and show what weapons would have been like at the time, it is a key moment for us to have something that embodied the destruction of war right at the heart of the museum."</p>
      <p>What, I ask Palmer, is the function of the museum - to record war, interpret war, or warn against its baleful consequences? "It's all those things," she says. "It's about telling the story, but it's about telling many stories, not just giving one overview. We offer a range of voices from a conflict and allow people to make up their own minds." She insists it will never be triumphalist. "It's about what people actually experienced, and trying to get that across."</p>
      <p>In that sense, it is pleasingly British and understated. Borg tells me that when the museum was conceived at the end of the first world war, there was a plan to give it a vast space in Whitehall. Instead, it began life as an open-air exhibition in Trafalgar Square, and was then shunted into cramped quarters in South Kensington, before finding its Southwark home in 1936. The proposed Whitehall museum might have fallen prey to glorification and political manipulation; here, among the park-dwellers of Southwark, it can offer a less statist take on war.</p>
      <p>Mrs Thatcher, when she was prime minister, wanted a bit more glorification, especially in the section devoted to the Falklands. Borg tells me a story about his first encounter with her. "She came round for a small dinner to launch our appeal in the 80s and I had to take her through the old galleries. My predecessor had done an exhibition called War, and it opened with a series of billboards - supposedly newspaper headlines but all, in fact, quotations from people about war. She immediately found one she didn't like - Benjamin Franklin's 'There was never a good war or a bad peace.' 'That's wrong,' she said. 'You should take that down.' I said, 'Prime Minister, you have to see that they're meant to be taking different views.' I rapidly scanned the wall for something I thought she would like, and said, 'Compare it to that one.' I forget what the line was, but I pointed to it, and then my eyes slipped to the attribution underneath. It said, 'Mao Zedong.' I thought, 'We are in for a bad evening.'"</p>
      <p>One day, some future Big Think</p>
      <p>really will have to consign the Imperial War Museum to history. There will come a point where the first world war ceases to look like the start of everything and becomes part of a continuum. How much longer can the war on terror and the struggles of the present century be treated as addenda to the great wars of the first half of the 20th century? Something will have to give. But, for the moment, we should celebrate the museum's reopening, and the British way of embracing difference - and diffidence. We may be unduly keen on going to war, but at least we haven't built a monument to our martial spirit. Which other country, after all, would have housed its military museum in a former asylum? War and the madness of war.</p>

      <title>Arab spring: Women sustained the uprising. But what can they expect in return?: Female protesters have had a key role in the tumult, but there are few signs that their rights will improve in an altered Arab world</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In a small room in Benghazi some young men and women are putting out a new opposition newspaper. "The role of the female in Libya," reads one headline. "She is the Muslim, the mother, the soldier, the protester, the journalist, the volunteer, the citizen", it adds.</p>
      <p>Arab women can claim to have been all these things and more during the three months of tumult that have shaken the region. Some of the most striking images of this season of revolt have been of women: black-robed and angry, a sea of female faces in the capitals of north Africa, the Arabian peninsula, the Syrian hinterland, marching for regime change, an end to repression, the release of loved ones. Or else delivering speeches to the crowds, treating the injured, feeding the sit-ins of Cairo and Manama and the makeshift army of eastern Libya.</p>
      <p>But as revolt turns into hiatus and stalemate from Yemen to Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, Bahrain and Syria, one thing is clear: for all their organising, marching, rabble-rousing, blogging, hunger-striking, and, yes, dying, Arab women are barely one small step forwards on the road to greater equality with their menfolk. Women may have sustained the Arab spring, but it remains to be seen if the Arab spring will sustain women.</p>
      <p>The first protests</p>
      <p>From the earliest rumblings of discontent in Tunisia at the turn of the year, it was clear that old images of Arab women as deferential, subservient and generally indoors would have to be revised. From the highly educated Tunisian female elite of doctors, barristers and university professors to the huge numbers of unemployed female graduates, women were key players in the uprising that launched the Arab spring.</p>
      <p>In Cairo, they were instrumental not just in protests but in much of the nitty-gritty organisation that turned Tahrir Square from a moment into a movement. Women were involved in arranging food deliveries, blankets, the stage and medical help. In Yemen, it was a young woman, Tawakul Karman, who first led demonstrations on a university campus against the long rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh. Karman emerged as one of the leaders of a revolution yet to run its course.</p>
      <p>In Bahrain, women were among the first wave that descended on Pearl Square in the capital - some with their children - to demand change. And the Bahraini movement has latterly found a figurehead in Zainab al-Khawaja, the woman who went on hunger strike in protest at the beating and arrest of her father, husband and brother-in-law. "Women have played a hugely influential role this time and put themselves in danger," said Nabeel Rajab, president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights. "They treated the injured in the streets and nursed them in their homes when they were too afraid to go to hospital."</p>
      <p>In Libya, women were at the vanguard too, when mothers, sisters and widows of men killed in a prison massacre in 1996 protested outside a courthouse in Benghazi after their lawyer was arrested.</p>
      <p>"Someone gave me a placard and I was not even sure what to do with it because we had never done anything like this before," said Muna Sahli, a literature lecturer at Garyounis University in Benghazi, whose brother-in-law was killed in the prison slaughter. "I even forgot to cover my face so I wouldn't be identified."</p>
      <p>In Syria and Yemen, more conservative societies, it took longer for women to join the movement en masse. In both countries, it took leadership blunders by the authorities to draw them in. In Syria, hundreds of women marched through the town of Beida to deplore the indiscriminate detention of many of their menfolk. In Yemen, when president Saleh said it was un-Islamic for male and female protesters to march side by side, thousands of women poured on to the streets just to prove him wrong. Women continue to support the demonstrations, working as nurses in makeshift hospitals and in ambulances, cooking food, delivering speeches and singing songs at the demonstrations. To the right of the main stage in Tagheer (meaning "change") Square, there is a large cordoned-off area filled with hundreds of women, most of them wearing black abayas, and small children.</p>
      <p>On the frontline</p>
      <p>Women have not escaped the human cost of this uprising. During the police repression of the Tunisian revolution, they were beaten by security thugs, and in rural areas around Kasserine some were raped by police after demonstrations. There were several reports of rape in Egypt amid the hurly burly, and a South African reporter for the US network CBS was sexually assaulted. In a notorious case in Tripoli, a woman, Iman al-Obeidi, said she was raped by about 15 pro-Gaddafi militia.</p>
      <p>Scores of women across the region have also been detained or disappeared. A number of Bahraini women have been seized by the authorities, including at least nine doctors and four nurses. In Yemen, Karman was detained for 48 hours, though the outrage caused was largely a function of the "shame" of male soldiers seizing a woman from her car in the night.</p>
      <p>But in some cases there was evidence that women were able to protest with relative impunity - and even used this to their advantage. "Since the beginning the riot police acted very brutally but the women stood their ground and waved their flags in their faces," said the Bahraini human rights activist Maryam al-Khawaja. "They were targeting the men, so the women kept coming out. Women have always had a presence (in public demonstrations in Bahrain) but this time it was very strong."</p>
      <p>In Syria, the reverse was true: women retreated in the face of the violence. On 16 March, a peaceful protest at the ministry of the interior by the families of political prisoners in Damascus ended in the arrests and beatings of many, including women and children. "I was hit several times but managed to get away," said the daughter of a prominent political prisoner, who asked not to be named.</p>
      <p>Another young woman in Damascus, who also asked not to be named, said that men were afraid for the safety of their women. "Since the start there has been live fire and men are afraid their mothers and sisters may be injured, as well as some of the women fearing this themselves," she said. She added that a lot of protests came out of the mosques, which are still largely male preserves. "Many younger women are going out, like at the university protest, but I think some women don't yet realise how crucial their participation is."</p>
      <p>Women of the regime</p>
      <p>Not every woman is for regime change. Yemeni women have staged vocal protests in favour of Saleh. And in western Libya, while women were largely absent from initial street protests that were suppressed by the regime, they have been conspicuous in more recent displays of loyalty to the Brother Leader, as Muammar Gaddafi is known. They chant, sing and ululate their praise - usually segregated from male supporters.</p>
      <p>At Gaddafi's Tripoli compound last week, hundreds of his female fans gathered late at night to act as human shields, many beautifully made up beneath their headscarves as if out for a night on the town. Which, in a way, it was.</p>
      <p>When Aisha Gaddafi, the leader's 34-year-old daughter, appeared on the balcony of a shelled building to address the crowd, they went wild. Aisha is an icon among many young Libyan women: smart, savvy, blond and with a penchant for designer clothes, she is known as Libya's Claudia Schiffer.</p>
      <p>The only daughter among Gaddafi's seven children, Aisha is the most high-profile woman in Libya. There is also a minister for women's and children's affairs, but few others in the regime. Among the phalanx of government officials dealing with the foreign media, only one is female. Women serve in the Libyan army, but do not take part in fighting. Gaddafi himself is famous for favouring female guards in his personal protection team.</p>
      <p>In common with many Arab countries, middle-class women in Libya tend to be highly educated and prevalent in professions such as medicine and the law. But their poorer sisters are confined largely to the home and the shadow of their menfolk.</p>
      <p>Legality, sorority, equality</p>
      <p>The Arab spring was not about gender equality. Women in all countries involved say that. But many are alarmed that their efforts risk going unrewarded, and that men who were keen to have them on the streets crying freedom may not be so happy to have them in parliament, government and business boardrooms. As one Egyptian protester told Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy supremo, during a recent visit to Tahrir Square: "The men were keen for me to be here when we were demanding that Mubarak should go. But now he has gone, they want me to go home."</p>
      <p>Egyptian women express concern that when the dust settles on their revolution and a new parliament is elected in November, there may be just as few female MPs as there were in the Mubarak era. The gender gap is gaping in Egypt. There were no references to equality in the new Egyptian constitution passed last month. Rebecca Chiao, founder of a women's rights group called Harassmap, said that there was already a backlash against gender equality. "There's a propaganda campaign against us, saying now is not the time for women's rights. I'm concerned about that," she said.</p>
      <p>"If you ask someone if they want gender equality, that's a loaded term here. Do you mean all women should be like men? Most would say no. If you mean women have choice and equal protection under the law, most would say yes."</p>
      <p>Tunisia's feminist lobby argues that the real battle is only beginning now, post-revolution. Of the country's young, well-educated unemployed - whose grievances sparked the uprising - two-thirds are women. There is still gross inequality in pay and in inheritance laws favouring sons. But the first battle is women in politics. Earlier this month, the commission reforming Tunisia's electoral landscape for the July elections voted that there must be 50% parity between men and women on electoral lists - and not just women on the bottom rung: they must alternate with male candidates from the top of each party selection and share the most important roles.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest opposition parties, the leftwing PDP, already has a female leader, the feminist biologist Maya Jribi. Campaigners hope others will follow.</p>
      <p>Leila Hamrouni, a secondary school teacher from a poor suburb of Tunis, is likely to run as a candidate for the party Ettajdid. She said: "We've got to really fight for 50% equality in the elections. I'm worried it won't be properly enforced. The smaller parties say it's great in principle but in practice there aren't enough 'competent' women. What rubbish! Even the rural areas have women lawyers, teachers and doctors.</p>
      <p>"Under Ben Ali, there were an awful lot of men who were far from brilliant, yet as soon as we talk of women in politics, everyone's asking about competence. Ben Ali used the issue of women's rights as propaganda for the west while stifling liberties and denying democracy. Some men might say to us now, 'Look what you've got. What more do you want?' It's difficult to explain that behind the orchestrated propaganda there is still so much to fight for."</p>
      <p>Khadija Cherif, a sociologist and university professor, is a member of the influential Association of Women Democrats and sits on the commission currently drawing up political rules for the July elections. Around 20% of the commission is female.</p>
      <p>"The women's role has been huge, not just in the revolution, but for years before it, from supporting the miners' strikes to staging sit-ins in textile factories. That role must now be recognised through gender equality on the political landscape."</p>
      <p>One concern on the secular left is that the return of Tunisia's Islamist parties could roll back the country's secular women's rights. The once outlawed Islamist party Ennahda denies it plans to limit women's rights, joining other parties in voting through the 50% gender equality rules for the election. Cherif said: "We're working with the Islamist parties. They supported us on parity. And they know we are staying vigilant."</p>
      <p>But elsewhere, women are adamant: this revolution was about regimes, not gender. "Men and women, we are all working for the same thing in this revolution," said Mervet el-Zuki, a Benghazi resident. "We want to be able to speak our minds, to be ourselves, to be Libyans. We want freedom in all sectors: psychologically, socially, economically. We want a happy ending, to be rid of this maniac family that controlled everything we did."</p>
      <p>Bahraini Noor Jilal added: "Women are not calling for their own rights but those of everyone."</p>
      <p>But Faizah Sulimani, 29, a protest leader in Yemen, hints that even though they are not calling for equality, women in Yemen have found themselves being taken much more seriously by men because of the impressive way they have contributed to the protest movement.</p>
      <p>"Our demands are somehow similar to men, starting with freedom, equal citizenship, and giving women a greater role in society," she says. "Women smell freedom at Change Square, where they feel more welcomed than ever before. Their fellow (male) freedom fighters are showing unconventional acceptance to their participation and they are actually for the first time letting women be, and say, what they really want."</p>

      <title>Comment: Today the tooth fairy turns cuts into efficiency savings: Forget ideology. The new dividing line in politics is not left and right but a quiet life versus tough decisions close to home</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>At least one unrealistic claim will be made today by the chancellor of the exchequer, Alistair Darling. He will say that swingeing cuts in the public sector need not damage frontline services. The reason is the tooth fairy. She alights each night on his pillow and turns £11bn of cuts into £11bn of "efficiency savings". This fairy is now the patron saint of politics.</p>
      <p>She has never been busier. According to the schools secretary, Ed Balls, £2bn of efficiency savings can be found in his budget "without affecting what happens in the classroom". A similar sum is available from the Gray efficiency savings at the defence ministry. Another £3bn a year is claimed by Gordon Brown from the central civil service over the next parliament. Then there is £500m available from quango administration, £500m from Alan Johnson's police budget, and £180m from Lord Mandelson's university overheads.</p>
      <p>Liam Byrne, chief secretary to the Treasury, is lyrical, claiming that "literally billions of pounds worth of efficiencies" are available from the £40bn he gives to local government. For a man whose own spending budget rose last year by 50,000% (thanks to bank bailouts), he should know.</p>
      <p>The tooth fairy is also dancing over the Tories and Liberal Democrats. David Cameron and George Osborne claim to have "discovered" £5bn of efficiency savings in the public sector. Cameron claims he can cut 20,000 bureaucrats and save £1.5bn from the NHS by setting up a giant quango to run it. The shadow Treasury spokesman goes even better. Philip Hammond can find "£60bn by persuading civil servants to work harder and be more efficient". He intends a "hearts and minds campaign" to this effect. Not to be outdone, Nick Clegg has £20bn of efficiency savings in his pocket, but is not revealing them.</p>
      <p>This is the politics of stupid, treating the public like idiots. Efficiency savings have become the ultimate political get-out-of-jail-free card to liberate us from a £175bn deficit. Apparently we can all avoid suffering because we have efficiency savings waiting in the wings, savings that will eliminate the deficit and yet save the nurse in the ward, the teacher in the classroom and the constable on the beat.</p>
      <p>If things were that easy, they would have happened. From Lord Rayner under Margaret Thatcher to Peter Gershon under Tony Blair, all incumbents of Downing Street nod in the direction of efficiency savings. Gershon even claimed to have "found" £21bn in 2007, over a decade in which statistics showed civil service productivity falling by 3.4% a year.</p>
      <p>The National Audit Office tut-tuts occasionally, but is dim of eye and blunt of tooth. It records only the remorseless rise in public sector employment, pay and expenditure under Brown. Meanwhile, Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, concluded last year that "most efficiency savings are exhausted" on the grounds that "the low-hanging fruit has already been picked".</p>
      <p>The efficiency savings gimmick received a boost in the 1990s with the techno-dazzle of e-government. By spending billions on huge computer systems, ministers could take on an aura of modernity and value for money while actually increasing the cost of government and reducing its efficacy. From child support through tax credits to student loans, the story is remarkable only in the immunity of ministers to accountability for the chaos.</p>
      <p>At the Rural Payments Agency, a computer has reportedly increased paper handling costs by 20% and led to the agency's 100 computer staff receiving an average wage of £200,000 a year. The agency is one giant taxpayer rip-off, but nobody cares. Hilary Benn is in charge and he would be more adept at ruling Paraguay. As for the defence ministry, not a year passes but its procurement executive is "overhauled" and made "subject to commercial discipline", to absolutely no effect.</p>
      <p>All who run big organisations know what can be cut. Otherwise they would not be running big organisations. In central government such leadership collapses for two reasons. One is that the money being wasted does not belong to those spending it, so why should they bother saving it? The other is that the boss is a minister or official who has seldom run so much as a sweetshop, and who hopes to move to another job before needing to cause pain to those round them.</p>
      <p>The routine is familiar. When asked for efficiency savings, the ministry plays for time and sends for consultants. Parliament is told to await a report. When it comes it is full of such phrases as "investing in change" and "driving forward the agenda of delivery". Nothing is done, except a computer is recommended that will "save the taxpayer millions". Britain buys the most government computers in Europe, with a fancy Office of Government Commerce to buy the best. Yet Whitehall is ranked bottom of seven western governments in the "scrap rate" of computer incompetence.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, cuts there must be and they are found as far down the food chain as possible, so the howls of pain are not heard at headquarters. Grants to charities are slashed, part-time staff laid off, sub-contracts cancelled, student grants cut, school trips ended, arts and historic buildings go. Nothing is new. All organisations grow from the head and cut from the tail.</p>
      <p>Over the coming year we shall hear much about cuts to government overheads, to red tape and "back of office expenses". We shall hear of a quango cull, an end to regional agencies, and a stop to prestige projects. We have heard of that from every incoming (and outgoing) government for a quarter-century. It does not happen. It takes too much courage.</p>
      <p>There is a new dividing line in politics that helps explain the conundrum of how George Bush could run for office against big government - as Cameron is doing - and create the biggest and most extravagant government in American history. The reason is that the divide in modern politics is not between ideologies. It is between styles of government, between "us and them" within the rambling citadel of public sector management. It is not left versus right, but overheads versus frontline, a quiet life versus tough decisions close to home.</p>
      <p>In Britain the divide is obliterated by frightened and inexperienced politicians eager for votes. They talk macho but when they walk the walk, they all join the quiet life party.</p>

      <p>Nadal speaks:</p>
      <p>The roof is too high so I don't think it affects [the match] a lot. A great opponent, I'm very happy to be through. I escaped some tough situations. Serving for the match at 5-4 I didn't play a good game. There are things to work on but the good thing is I'm going to have the chance to improve it.</p>

      <p>6-1, as he pounds Khachanov into submission. Five match points. Khachanov nets his first serve, makes the second, Nadal unwinds on the forehand side... but slaps into the net! 6-2. 6-3, after Khachanov, controlling play from the net, moves Nadal from one corner to the other. So match point No 3... and Khachanov, after four hours and 22 minutes of play, can't get the return back! Nadal, from a set and a break down, survives a brutal battle! Khachanov leaves the court to a standing ovation from the crowd - the 22-year-old's won some hearts today. That was a match to savour.</p>

      <p>Fourth-set tie-break: *Nadal 5-1 Khachanov</p>
      <p>Khachanov, having looked sluggish for much of this set, is moving so much better now, and is going toe-to-toe with Nadal on the opening three points, which go with serve. Nadal leads 2-1. But then Nadal seizes the initiative, taking the first mini-break by coming to the net, and then a second too. 4-1, 5-1 at the change of ends...</p>

      <p>There's nothing to choose between them on the total points won so far: 150-150, even though Nadal is ahead on the scoreboard. 15-0, 30-0. 30-15 after a Khachanov rocket. Nadal snatches at his shot and nets. 30-all. A wayward Nadal forehand later and the defending champion, from having served for the match, is set point down! Nadal rediscovers his forehand and Khachanov nets. Nadal hits deep and true and Khachanov goes long. Nadal's advantage. A game of cat and mouse, including a tweener from Khachanov, which has plenty of pace but Nadal is able to get his racket to it and volley away the winner. It's tie-break time again!</p>

      <p>Signs that Khachanov may be cramping as he hits his quads with his racket and shakes his legs. That break must have taken a lot out of him. At 30-all, you wonder whether he may be in trouble but he dismisses any danger. 40-30, game. He's earned himself a tie-break at the very least.</p>

      <p>It's Nadal who's had a greater success rate at the net today but Khachanov comes forward to take the first point. 0-15. That'll give Nadal something to think about. And after that winning volley from Khachanov, Nadal misses a routine one of his own! 0-30. A relatively straightforward forehand for Nadal... and he nets! 0-40. Three break-back points. Nadal is sending Khachanov left and right and left but Khachanov keeps up before producing the winner to break! Another twist in the tale. There's no doubt Nadal tightened up there.</p>

      <p>I'm sure Serena and Venus are cheering on Rafa too, they don't want their Friday night fight under the lights to be delayed. Khachanov holds but unless he can break Nadal pretty soon this match will be over. And Nadal isn't looking too charitable. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. He's increased the power on his forehand in this set and he's potentially a game away from a place in the fourth round.</p>

      <p>And then out of nowhere, Khachanov has 0-30 on Nadal's serve after a forehand blast down the line. I hope for his sake - and mine - he doesn't break here, because I'm not sure how much either of us have got left in the tank. He's been going nearly four hours now, I've been going for seven. Though admittedly it's only my fingers and neck that hurts, I can't imagine how he's feeling after going four hours and four sets against the world No 1. Nadal hears my plea, and knifes a volley for 30-all, before taking the next two points too. Thanks Rafa.</p>

      <p>A hold to love for Nadal. Khachanov, understandably, looks deflated. Two more double faults from the Russian, to add to those three in the breaker, and Nadal breaks to gain a stranglehold on the match. Nadal has done what Nadal does, grinding his opponent down with his relentless intensity. Taking a set against Nadal is one thing, but managing to consistently hit through him to win three is quite another.</p>

      <p>Khachanov hit three double faults in that breaker. Ouch. He'll be having nightmares about those tonight if he goes on to lose. But at 22, he's still learning how to deal with the big moments. And he'll have plenty more big moments in the future if he continues to play as well as he has today. Khachanov manages to put the tie-break out of his mind to hold at the start of the fourth set.</p>

      <p>Nadal wins the third-set tie-break 9-7!</p>
      <p>Nadal regroups. It's a fourth set point for Nadal at 7-6 - but it's on Khachanov's serve. Nadal can't make an impact. 7-7. But Khachanov then doubles! A fifth set point. And this is on Nadal's racket. Nadal nets his first serve, gets the second in... he's grunting, grunting, grunting, running, running, running, pounding, pounding, pounding, this point feels like it's never going to end... but eventually it does after 39 (THIRTY NINE!) shots when Nadal comes forward, forcing Khachanov into the error! Phew. That would have been a fine way to end the match. But we've still got at least another set of this. Sit tight.</p>

      <p>The first - on Khachanov's serve - goes by. As does the second. Both after unforced errors from Nadal, if you can call an error unforced at this stage of a match. But now Nadal has a set point on his serve... he's fidding with his hair, touching his face, bounce, bounce, bouncing the ball... and he gets a warning for going over the shot clock! Nadal doesn't seem too thrown, he sends down the serve but Khachanov goes on to save a third set point...!</p>

      <p>Third-set tie-break Nadal 6-3 Khachanov*</p>
      <p>... Nadal is dawdling a bit at 4-3, and with the shot clock ticking down he serves just in time. The longest rally of the match goes Nadal's way. 5-3. The pair mix some brutal hitting with some slicing and dicing on the next point, Nadal draws Khachanov in with the drop shot before rifling the winner. 6-3, three set points...</p>

      <p>Nadal, having taken the opening two points, should really win the third too but he blinks. A reprieve for Khachanov because that would have given Nadal two mini-breaks. 2-1. 3-1, after a superb half-volley from Nadal. They slug it out on the next point, and Khachanov hits with such depth on the backhand that Nadal can't reply. 3-2. They're back on serve... but not for long, because Khachanov hands the mini-break back to Nadal with a double fault...</p>

The result will be of interest to Nadal and Khachanov, because whoever emerges from this encounter - which is close to stretching over three hours - will play Basilashvili next. A fairly business-like hold from Nadal at the business end of the set.</p>

The crowd are on their feet when Nadal adeptly turns defence into attack for 15-all on Khachanov's serve. A Khachanov ace and a wild forehand from Nadal later, and it's 40-15. Khachanov catches Nadal out with a body serve to seal the game.</p>

      <p>Anderson has taken a two sets to one lead over Shapovalov, leading 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Given the way these two matches have been mirroring each other, it may be a good omen for Nadal. Right on cue, Nadal has 15-30 on Khachanov's serve. An inexplicable miss from Khachanov at the net and it's break point at 30-40! A serve missile down the middle, Nadal blocks the return back, it's high, it drops and clips the line... but no, Khachanov stops the point to challenge! And the Russian's right! Hawk-Eye shows it was out. Deuce. And Khachanov holds!</p>

      <p>Khachanov's forehand has been ferocious in this match but Nadal's forehand, of course, ain't too bad either and the top seed has more winners on that side, 20 to 14. Make that 20 to 15, as Khachanov lets rip once more. Jim Courier mentions on the commentary that Nadal lost to Djokovic under the roof in the Wimbledon semi-finals, a match he had enough chances to win. Will there be any scarring from that encounter here? His serving percentage has certainly dropped indoors in this set - and he's under pressure at deuce. Khachanov lets him off the hook with a loose lob, and the Russian then biffs a backhand well beyond the baseline.</p>

      <p>Nadal, having worked so hard to get into the match, could really do without crashing 0-40 down in the opening game of the third set. Khachanov has a good conversion rate on break points so far, taking four of six compared to Nadal's four from 11, but all three come and go this time.

Khachanov double faults on the first game point... and repeats the trick on the second! He didn't even get close with that second serve. Khachanov puts that out of his mind to move to his advantage, but two points later it's Nadal's advantage, set point. A strong first serve down the T... Nadal chops it back, Khachanov comes to the net, Nadal is having to run and run... and Khachanov's volley is out! Nadal, not at his best for much of this set, shows tremendous courage and commitment to level the match.</p>

      <p>Thanks Niall. Well, well. Some rain to add to the drama. There's a bit of indecision about whether to close the roof, eventually it's agreed they will do. Which means a break of about five minutes or so. Who does it favour? Hard to say. It'll give Nadal a bit of time to think tactics but it could check his momentum, having just broken Khachanov. And Nadal's much happier playing outdoors than indoors.</p>

      <p>The skies look ominous, a metaphor for Nadal's current situation. Khachanov's never taken a set off Nadal. He's going to here it seems. 15-0. 30-0. But how silly to doubt Nadal. 15-30. 30-all. 30-40, when Khachanov smacks into the net. Win this break point and Nadal will secure himself a tie-break. But he can't get his return back and Khachanov brings up set point with a winning volley! The Russian rifles wide! Deuce. Advantage Khachanov, a second set point, thanks to a seventh ace. An enthralling exchange... and Nadal eventually takes it with an outrageous forehand winner! Deuce. Advantage Khachanov, set point No 3. The pair give it everything they've got... and Nadal hits deep into the corner before dinking a volley over! Deuce. Advantage Khachanov, set point No 4. This time Khachanov does see Nadal off, with an ace. The Russian's staging a revolution on Ashe, he's taken the opening set against the defending champion!</p>

      <p>Nadal continues his revival with a drama-free hold. The defending champion's pounding away from the back of the court on Khachanov's serve but the Russian repels his opponent impressively, coming through to love. 5-5. With both looking strong on serve at this stage, there's a sense the set is heading for a tie-break. But as I write that, Nadal gives Khachanov a glimmer at 15-30. Khachanov clunks into the net but Nadal then frames a forehand. 30-40, break point. And Khachanov charges forward to punish a weak volley from Nadal! Khachanov will serve for the set!</p>

      <p>Khachanov hasn't missed a first serve yet. 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, game. This, of course, is far too early for Nadal to be too concerned but the opening games have highlighted the challenge Khachanov presents. The 22-year-old hits the ball bloody hard and has a stinging serve too. He's already struck eight winners and four aces. Nadal could do with a steadying service game here and he gets it. He takes the game with a forehand volley and looks pretty pumped. He needs to be against such a dangerous opponent.</p>

      <p>The roof, having been closed for the finale of Stephens v Azarenka, is now open again, which should play into Nadal's hands as he much prefers playing outdoors than indoors. It's almost a blink-and-you'll-miss-it opening service game from Nadal, but there again it's very hard to miss Nadal today given his luminous pink attire. And from a hold to 15, Nadal gets to 15-40 on Khachanov's serve. Two break points. Nadal goes long on the return and decides to wipe himself down with the towel to absorb his frustration. A 132mph ace and it's deuce. Khachanov dismisses the danger to hold.</p>

He ended Daveeed Ferreeerrrrrr's grand slam career in the first round, playing only one and a half sets before his fellow Spaniard retired injured, and then brushed aside Vasek Pospisil in round two. Having started the tournament as the bookies' second favourite for the title, behind Novak Djokovic, he's now taken top spot.</p>
      <p>Nadal leads the head-to-head with Khachanov 4-0, including a victory at Wimbledon last year, but the Russian pushed him in the Toronto semi-finals this month. Khachanov undoubtedly has the firepower to take a set or two off Nadal but the question is whether he can sustain that in a best-of-five match.</p>

      <p>Azarenka, knowing she must hold serve to stay in this captivating contest, loses the first point after a 22-shot rally of the highest quality. 0-15. Stephens's forehand dips just in time to graze the baseline. Wow. 0-30. Another breathtaking point as Azarenka scrambles back to retrieve the lob before going on to unleash a backhand winner. 15-30. But Azarenka will be diappointed with the way she gives Stephens double match point. A strong first serve is backed up by a backhand bullet from Azarenka but Stephens absorbs the artillery and then launches an attack of her own, charging forward to end with a forehand cross-court winner! Stephens advances, Azarenka is out, but the former world No 1 is undoubtedly on her way back.</p>

      <p>And they're back. I wonder if they were able to get any coaching during the break. The rules allow it during a rain interruption but during a roof-closing break, I'm not sure. Andy Murray certainly won't be happy if either of them have broken the rules after his row with Fernando Verdasco the other night.</p>
      <p>So Azarenka is serving. The break has perhaps broken her concentration because she's 30-40, break point down. Azarenka is banging her face in frustration. And she's chastising herself when a poorly-thought through point ends in Stephens's favour. They're back on serve.</p>

Azarenka comes out on top in a draining duel and it's 15-40, double break point. Her return on the first break point is long, she thinks about the challenge but then decides against it. 30-40. Then just as they're mid-point... my feed freezes. Gah! Though it comes back just as Azarenka nets a volley. Deuce. Advantage Stephens. Deuce. Advantage Azarenka. These games are so close right now.

And the 19th seed Anastasija Sevastova, a US Open quarter-finalist in 2016 and 2017, has beaten Russia's Ekaterina Makarova 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, closing it out with a perfect drop shot. And just as I'm watching that, Azarenka breaks back! Stephens's service level has dropped a little in this set and the American gives Azarenka a lifeline in this match with a double fault on break point.</p>

      <p>Stephens is serving superbly and has missed only one first serve in 20 so far, with her percentage at 95%. Another four first serves help her take the game to 15. But it's not only her serve that is firing today; her groundstrokes and movement is looking so secure too. Stephens has so much to her game. She's one of the best movers, has great balance and so much natural power. When she puts all this together and it's functioning, she's a phenomenal player. It's certainly clicking here, as she brings up a triple set point at 0-40 on Azarenka's serve... and Azarenka nets! Stephens is looking strong.</p>

      <p>The weather in New York is much cooler today but that's about the only respite Azarenka is getting, because Stephens is making this a fairly unpleasant experience for the Belarusian. Stephens, with one foot on Azarenka's throat, charges through on serve. But suddenly Azarenka wriggles free.

      <p>Stephens sprints to 40-0, before overhitting a forehand for 40-15. She does a little practice swing at the back of the court - remember the shot clock, Sloane! - but it does the trick and she secures the hold on the next point. Stephens, such a superb athlete, perhaps has a bit more of a spring in her step than Azarenka, and the American is asking questions of Azarenka's serve once more at 0-30. But she then batters a backhand into the net. Make that two battered backhands into the net. 30-all. 30-40, break point, courtesy of a 90mph forehand from Stephens. And Azarenka very generously gifts Stephens the first break of the match with a double fault!</p>

An errant backhand from Azarenka - which skids well into the tramlines - and it's 30-all. Stephens steps forward to put a forehand into a wide open space for break point. A "COME ON" from Azarenka as she saves it and gets herself to deuce. And from there the Belarusian holds.</p>

      <p>So this is a match between two grand slam champions, with Stephens the defending champion in New York and Azarenka winning the Australian Open in 2012 and 2013, as well as reaching the US Open final in both of those years.</p>
      <p>Stephens has been inconsistent in the opening two rounds, which sums up her season too. The American reached the French Open final and won the Miami title but also suffered first-round exits at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Azarenka's year, meanwhile, seems to be on an upward trajectory. The former world No 1 is playing with a weight off her shoulders, after the resolution of a custody battle that meant she couldn't take her son out of California. Serena Williams may be generating most of the headlines as a returning mother here - but Azarenka is making her mark too.</p>
      <p>Stephens beat Azarenka in three sets at Indian Wells and also in Miami this year but Azarenka is in a much better place now and has looked very sharp so far. If Stephens plays like she did in the second round, she could be out.</p>

      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>Serena and Venus Williams first played each other on tour in the second round of the 1998 Australian Open, with Venus beating her younger sister 7-6, 6-1. Their dreams and proclamations were, of course, already big, fuelled by their father, who for many years had told them - and the world - that they would be the best two players on the planet. But surely not even he, or a 16-year-old Serena or 17-year-old Venus, could have imagined that 20 years, 29 meetings and a combined 30 grand slam titles later, with the sisters boasting a collective age of 74, that they'd still be battling it out against each other at a slam.</p>
      <p>The Williamses' headline act under the lights tonight makes what comes before it on Arthur Ashe feel like a warm-up, even though the two defending champions are both playing in the afternoon session. Sloane Stephens will need to be at her best against the rejuvenated former world No 1 V ictoria Azarenka, while Rafael Nadal faces his first real test of the tournament against the rising Russian Karen Khachanov.</p>
      <p>Nadal isn't the only 30-something to be pitted against a Next Gen talent, with the man he beat in last year's final, Kevin Anderson, playing Denis Shapovalov on Louis Armstrong. That's where the 2016 champion Stan Wawrinka and Milos Raonic will meet too. Other names in third-round action include John Isner, the French Open runner-up Dominic Thiem, the former finalist Karolina Pliskova, the seventh seed Elina Svitolina and the Australian No 1 Ashleigh Barty. And let's not forget Daniil Medvedev v Borna Coric and the battle of the forehands between Juan Martin del Potro and Fernando Verdasco, which follows Williams v Williams XXX on Ashe.</p>
      <p>Play begins on Arthur Ashe at : 12pm ET/5pm BST.</p>
      <p>Play on the other courts : is already under way. Belgium's Elise Mertens has an early break, 3-1, against the Czech Barbora Strycova, while Ekaterina Makarova, who defeated the Wimbledon semi-finalist Julia Goerges in round two, leads Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova 4-2.</p>

      <title>Friday review: GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY: She caused shockwaves as a necrophiliac in Kissed. Now she's back in two new roles - a lap-dancer and a motel clerk who beds all the guests. Molly Parker tells Emma Brockes why these parts will help women gain respect</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Molly Parker is tired this morning, drained by the heat and the couple in the next-door hotel room. "They've been having sex pretty much for two days," she says, lifting her shoulders in a gesture of urbane exasperation. "It is so loud." Gallingly, it's all too close to the actress's recent work. In her two latest films, she plays by turn a motel clerk who articulates her despair by screwing all the guests, and a stripper. The 28-year-old rolls her acid-green eyes and looks at the ceiling; you just can't get away from it.</p>
      <p>Parker, a Canadian, is physiognomically at odds with both roles. From some angles she looks like Bjork, a child on the brink of doing something puzzling. From others she's more like an heiress in an Edith Wharton adaptation: almond-shaped face, chalk-white complexion, a willowy figure who looks as if she might exhaust herself in the engagement of anything more vigorous than beating a fan. Watching her cavorting on stage in Wayne Wang's The Center of the World and getting roughed up as a prostitute in Suspicious River, Lynne Stopkewich's film about self-destruction, brings on twinges of what's a nice girl like you doing in an ugly story like this? Her last memorable outing was as Sandra in Kissed, a film about necrophilia.</p>
      <p>Of course, Parker has done comedies and conventional thrillers in between the creepy stuff. She was Molly in Wonderland, Michael Winterbottom's portrait of London; and Daisy in The Intruder, a dumb, stylish film about a haunted apartment block. But it is the sexually explicit stuff that has brought her to prominence, a fact she finds significant. Parker is expert at exposing the hypocritical fault lines between public prurience and disapproval.</p>
      <p>The Center of the World, in which Parker's character Florence is paid to spend a weekend in Las Vegas with internet geek Richard (Peter Sarsgaard), is her most serious interrogation of the theme yet. The film is explicit enough to guarantee Parker the plaudit "brave", if nothing else. The film is a radical protest against punishing the sex-worker rather than her client, and two hours of watching her lap-dance for Richard - as he squirms and apologises and does his "I'm just an average guy looking for jollies" act - leaves you convinced that Florence is the norm and Richard the loathsome deviant.</p>
      <p>"Wayne was particularly uninterested in making it palatable to the mainstream," says Parker. "If anything, I think he was interested in going much further than he did. But I didn't think that was necessary. That's not what the movie is about. It is not about being sexy as much as about sex itself; therefore about power. It's about fantasy . . . performance. It's also about capitalism. I think we live in a fairly pornographic world - not in terms of imagery, but in terms of creating insatiable desires in people as the best formula to sell them shit they don't want."</p>
      <p>After she made the film, Parker's thesis on pornography was immediately ratified by the activities of the studio's marketing department. Given that the film critiques the idea of sex as currency, it is ironic - moronic - that it has been straightforwardly marketed for titillation: the publicity material depicts a woman fellating a lollipop. "I get a little annoyed," says Parker, brightly. "I mean the movie was marketed as a sex film, the posters were sort of . . . I mean . . . which is not the point of the film. It makes no sense to me whatsoever. I understand totally that in terms of putting people into the theatre you have too . . . but I mean . . ." She sighs desperately and gives up.</p>
      <p>This is the classic trap and she knows it. The risk of doing this sort of film is that the actress's efforts to justify the racy bits might not survive the director's cut. Wang was entirely sympathetic - he interviewed more sex workers than Parker did, to ensure that the tone was right. But she concedes that this was good luck rather than good management. "What the movie ends up being is not necessarily in my control. What I can do is ask questions that I think are important, such as: whose gaze is this? Whose point of view is this story coming from? Why are you putting the camera there? Why do you want to see that? It is to make sure, for me, that women are respected. That doesn't mean only choosing characters who are strong and correct - they can be weak and flawed, but the treatment must be responsible."</p>
      <p>I made the mistake of watching The Center of the World back to back with Suspicious River. Seen in tandem, they can wipe out your weekend. While the former film is depressing in a general, sad-old-state-of-the-world type way, Stopkewich's film is just randomly excruciating: the story of a woman's voluntary submission to the thugs who stay at her motel. With nerves deadened by childhood trauma, she tries to bring herself back to life by exposing herself to attack. The rape scenes (there are three) are horribly violent. Whatever wider points it makes, it is impossible to watch the film without thinking first of the actress: why would anyone put themselves through that?</p>
      <p>"There were days in both films when I thought, ugh, what am I doing?" says Parker. "But weirdly, this happened less in Suspicious River. It was really gruelling, physically - it just rained every day and was shitty. But it wasn't as emotionally demanding as I thought it would be, and at first I didn't know why. I had a feeling I was going to be really wrecked by it, and then when we started filming I was sort of OK. I could relax and laugh at the end of the day, read a book, whatever. And I started to think, oh God, I'm not working hard enough. I'm not doing it right, it should be more difficult. And then I realised that this woman I was playing was so disconnected, her mind and body were in such completely different places and she was so numbed by the life that she'd led, that it was sort of appropriate not to feel anything."</p>
      <p>The only time she cried was during the research period. "I went to a strip club in LA in the afternoon, and there was a dancer who had agreed to talk to me. And it was this seedy, seedy bar, which was really depressing. She was very generous. But there was a point after about an hour and a half when I had to go outside to put money in the meter and I just started crying and had to run."</p>
      <p>Parker was able to do the tough scenes in Suspicious River only because she trusted Stopkewich, her director in the equally difficult Kissed. Her test question ("Whose gaze is this?") was less defensively asked - generally the case, she says, when it is a woman directing her in a sex scene. Still, there were conflicts. "It took me almost to the end of shooting to understand what Lynne was looking for out of this woman. We would have these intense battles over scenes and they always had me on the side of realism and her on the side of a stylised performance. I didn't understand that this was what we were fighting about, and if I had, I would probably not have fought so much. The way Lynne has me look in her films, there's a feeling that it could almost be a dream, some sort of other world. And . . . and . . . I've lost my train of thought. There it goes."</p>
      <p>This is where the willowy pallor is put to use; on screen, Parker wafts around the desolate small town like a metaphor for vulnerability. Oddly, it is the town where she grew up, Pitt Meadows, outside Vancouver. The motel they used is five minutes from her mother's house. Her parents used to own a seafood store and a farm. "Not a dairy farm," says Parker, "but like a hippie farm with chickens and goats." Stopkewich calls the actress's upbringing a "60s experiment gone right".</p>
      <p>Parker started out as a ballet dancer, training between the ages of three and 17 before realising that acting was more her bag and enrolling in the Gastown actor's studio in Vancouver. She tried to develop style without conceit. "I'm probably an actor that tends to, instead of putting things on, think about it more in terms of taking away what's not in the character, until I'm left with what is. If that makes sense. That's probably a particularly American way of working, but maybe not. The end of any movie is a readjustment."</p>
      <p>One of the things she rated most about Peter Sarsgaard, her co-star in The Center of the World, was his unpreciousness. "I adore the fact that he's not concerned about being likeable. I think a lot of actors are overly concerned about being well liked in the parts they play. And that is so not a concern of his." She's not that fussed about it, either.</p>
      <p>Suspicious River is out next Friday. The Center of the World is out on September 21.</p>

      <title>England beat Pakistan by 84 runs to win ODI series 3-1 - as it happened</title>
      <subtitle>Jos Buttler guided England to 355-5 with a spectacular 46-ball century, the fastest in ODIs by an England player, and Pakistan fell 84 runs short with Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid taking three wickets each</subtitle>

      <p>England's players, weighed down after receiving an endless supply of novelty cheques, gather round the trophy. A job very well done in tough conditions, bouncing back from the Test defeat in style. As Eoin Morgan pointed out, everyone has played their part, culminating in Jos Buttler stepping out of his slump to guide England home in the third match, and clinch the series today.</p>
      <p>That's it from me; we'll be back for the three-match T20 series, which rounds off England's stay in the Gulf, and begins next Thursday. Won't you join us? Thanks for reading. Bye!</p>

      <p>Here comes Eoin Morgan. "Outstanding performance today, the most impressive thing was the batting... Jos Buttler was outstanding, and he was set up by Joe Root and Jason Roy early in the innings."</p>
      <p>On their bowling performance: "we were conceding runs at a clip but we kept taking wickets. This series has been a huge learning curve, but our big performances has been shared around.</p>
      <p>On the spinners, and Alex Hales, making the breakthrough: "the spinners haven't let us down in this series, today was no different. Moeen and Adil were brilliant. [Hales] held two after putting one two, and that shows a lot of character."</p>

      <p>Azhar Ali: "That big innings [from Buttler] was the difference, although we made a good start to our innings... it's a big loss, congratulations to England, they played well... over the series, we played some bad cricket."</p>
      <p>Azhar gives full credit to Buttler, but says he is disappointed with the bowling at the end of England's innings. A frank assessment from the Pakistan captain.</p>

      <p>The man of the match award goes to... Jos Buttler. Not a massive surprise. The man of the series award goes to... also Jos Buttler. He was England's leading run-scorer, and edges out Chris Woakes, who took eight wickets in the series.</p>
      <p>Buttler: "Today was really satisfying for me, great to win the series most of all. It was one of those days, it's amazing how things turn around."</p>
      <p>His favourite six? The one that got him to his century. "I'll remember that feeling for a long time".</p>

      <p>England win by 84 runs to win the ODI series 3-1!</p>
      <p>In the end, Jos Buttler's heroics put the match beyond Pakistan's reach, as they slumped to 271 all out after a defiant start to the innings. England win comfortably to complete an impressive series win, bouncing back from an opening defeat to win the series 3-1.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.12pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Anwar c Rashid b Moeen 24</p>
      <p>Anwar clubs the ball glumly to Rashid at cover, who scoops it up in front of him. Both umpires think it's out, but they check with the third umpire, just to delay the inevitable. It's out, and it's all over!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.08pm GMT</p>
      <p>40th over: Pakistan 271-9 (Anwar 24, Irfan 0) Irfan is stuck on strike, with each successful straight bat met with cheers that may or may not be ironic. Woakes fires in a bouncer which hits the lofty No11 in the armpit. A maiden, the first of the innings.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.06pm GMT</p>
      <p>39th over: Pakistan 271-9 (Anwar 24, Irfan 0) Anwar sees out the over. It's a matter of time now, with the crowd turning from cheers to disgruntled mumbling.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.04pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Yasir c Woakes b Ali 5</p>
      <p>Yasir offers a big swing into the on side, and it sails straight to Woakes at cow corner. Mohammed Irfan is all that stands between England and a 3-1 series victory.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 6.02pm GMT</p>
      <p>38th over: Pakistan 270-8 (Anwar 23, Yasir 5) Woakes returns - he would be especially keen to tidy up the tail end, with a place in the side against South Africa very much up for grabs. Yasir is composed enough, exchanging singles with Anwar, before a clip into the leg side for another.</p>
      <p>Pakistan need more than that though, and Anwar takes a big swing, the ball dropping way short of the boundary. Willey races in from long on, but can't reach it - the ball instead crushing his finger as it falls from the sky. He's clearly in some pain, and I wouldn't expect him to return to the attack today.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.56pm GMT</p>
      <p>37th over: Pakistan 266-8 (Anwar 21, Yasir 3) There's an appeal as Yasir looks to have edged through to Buttler, but replays suggest the bat struck the turf. Yasir picks up three runs either side of that awkward moment, before Anwar, who isn't licked yet, smacks the final ball of the over beyond midwicket in defiant fashion.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.53pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Wahab c &amp; b Ali 1</p>
      <p>No such heroics from Wahab, who is out second ball! Moeen gets a bit of turn to outfox the batsman, who prods the ball straight back to him. Pakistan's defiant chase is in danger of going out with a whimper.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.52pm GMT</p>
      <p>36th over: Pakistan 258-7 (Anwar 17, Wahab 1) Wahab, who hit an unbeaten 33 in Sharjah, is next to the crease. Anwar keeps motoring, spanking consecutive fours to keep the scoreboard moving, even if the wickets are running out.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.54pm GMT</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.48pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Sarfraz c Willey b Rashid 24</p>
      <p>Sarfraz sends Rashid for four with an impetuous slap shot down the ground. He tries to repeat the trick next ball, and sends it straight to Willey at mid-on. That rather sums up this series for Pakistan's batsmen - deadly one minute, daft the next.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.46pm GMT</p>
      <p>35th over: Pakistan 245-6 (Sarfraz 20, Anwar 9) Sarfraz, who has grubbed his way to 16 off 20, picks up another couple with a sweep to bring up 1000 ODI runs. A single puts Anwar on strike, and Moeen keeps the batsmen running for singles with an impressive, conservative over.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.46pm GMT</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.43pm GMT</p>
      <p>34th over: Pakistan 240-6 (Sarfraz 16, Anwar 8) Sarfraz lashes towards midwicket, and Morgan, diving full to his left, gets fingertips to it. That would have been an exceptional catch. Anwar, who is certainly capable of clearing the fence, picks up four along the ground with a well-timed sweep.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.43pm GMT</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.39pm GMT</p>
      <p>33rd over: Pakistan 231-6 (Sarfraz 14, Anwar 1) Malik joins Babar Azam in departing straight after reaching his half-century. Four of Pakistan's batsmen have departed on scores between 37 and 52; if any of them had stuck around, Pakistan would probably be favourites now. As it is, Anwar Ali comes to the crease with just four wickets required for England to win the series.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.35pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Malik c Hales b Topley 52</p>
      <p>If that first drop from Hales was the moment Pakistan started to believe, this quite spectacular catch may mark the beginning of the end. Malik tries to club a Topley full toss over midwicket, but it drops short. Hales still has plenty to do, racing in from deep square to take a diving catch. About ten times harder than the one he dropped.</p>

      <p>32nd over: Pakistan 227-5 (Malik 52, Sarfraz 11) Malik completes his half-century in just 31 balls - including five boundaries - picking up seven runs in three balls as Rashid goes fuller to little effect. Ten runs off the over, England proving unable to stem the tide at the moment.</p>

      <p>31st over: Pakistan 217-5 (Malik 43, Sarfraz 10) Topley continues, but the runs keep trickling in, with both batsmen poking tentatively around the field to pick up a slew of singles. Topley, conceding nine runs an over, has been England's most expensive bowler, and there's some competition.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.26pm GMT</p>
      <p>30th over: Pakistan 211-5 (Malik 39, Sarfraz 8) Dot, dot, dot, four from Sarfraz, as he bides his time with Rashid before sending a flatter ball sweetly through midwicket. This has been toe-to-toe stuff from the start, with momentum edging either way on a ball-by-ball basis. Pakistan will be happy with their run rate, England pleased with their haul of five wickets at the 30-over mark.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.27pm GMT</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.23pm GMT</p>
      <p>29th over: Pakistan 206-5 (Malik 39, Sarfraz 3) Topley comes back into the attack. Interesting choice. Sarfraz attemps a cut to point, but his momentum is stalled by his bat snapping at the handle in mid-air. That's a shoddy piece of kit right there. Sarfraz has to wait for a new bat, then prods a single away with Topley coming round the wicket. Sarfraz continues an eventful over with a hasty single, Moeen almost running him out with a direct hit from some distance away. It's another final-ball boundary, but a fortunate one, as Topley's yorker finds a thick inside edge and flies away past fine leg.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 5.17pm GMT</p>
      <p>28th over: Pakistan 197-5 (Malik 32, Sarfraz 1) England are chipping away at the order, with Rashid getting two key wickets to swing the momentum back in their favour. Sarfraz is another aggressive, intelligent batsman though - this game could hinge on how long Pakistan can preserve this partnership.</p>

      <p>Rizwan gets in on the act with a six, moving down the track to smack a straight Rashid delivery down the ground. Rashid isn't having that, and brings out a leg-breaker which Rizwan misreads, edging through to Buttler!</p>

      <p>27th over: Pakistan 188-4 (Malik 30, Rizwan 4) Pakistan's halfway mark score of 176 is their highest since the distant, nu-metal days of 2000. Woakes with a welcome quiet over here, restricting the batsmen to two singles - until, you guessed it, the last ball, which Malik drives cannily over mid on for four.</p>

      <p>26th over: Pakistan 182-4 (Malik 25, Rizwan 4) Pakistan have shown some uncharacteristic steel, with everyone (with the possible exception of Shahzad) choosing their shots nicely. Rizwan gets in on the act, with a masterful sweep for four, off the first ball faced.</p>

      <p>WICKET! Babar Azam c Hales b Rashid 51</p>
      <p>Redemption for Hales, clearing two other fielders out of his way and taking a one-handed catch from deep cover to dismiss Babar Azam, who went for the rope off Rashid and just got underneath it. That's a timely breakthrough, and no mistake.</p>

      <p>25th over: Pakistan 176-3 (Babar Azam 50, Malik 23) Azam inches towards his half-century with a quick double, as Woakes returns to the attack. On 49, Azam swings at a delivery outside off, and almost edges through to Buttler. He regains his composure to tuck a single through the off-side to get his half-century off 49 balls. We're halfway through, and Pakistan are, give or take a couple of runs, halfway to their target.</p>

      <p>24th over: Pakistan 171-3 (Babar Azam 47, Malik 23) Here's an eye-watering stat: England had seven fours after 23 overs; Pakistan have 17, and five sixes. Rashid, England's most economical bowler, keeps the batsmen on the defensive in this over, with just three off the first five balls... and then Malik ends the over with a booming six, crashed back down the ground. There's a pattern emerging here.</p>

      <p>23rd over: Pakistan 162-3 (Babar Azam 45, Malik 16) Pakistan have continued with their aggressive approach, and Malik dances down the pitch, sending a gigantic six over midwicket. That even cleared the first tier of the stands. Malik follows that up with two run from a tickle off his pads, and the batsmen run another quick double to end an expensive over for England.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.51pm GMT</p>
      <p>22nd over: Pakistan 150-3 (Babar Azam 45, Malik 5) Rashid continues, with Malik making his first impression with a cover drive that gleans a couple of runs. Rashid, left out of the Test squad for the tour of South Africa, has looked dangerous, and again has Babar Azam looking edgy with a couple of turning deliveries.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.48pm GMT</p>
      <p>21st over: Pakistan 146-3 (Babar Azam 45, Malik 2) Shoaib Malik, who was run out in similarly farcical circumstances in the last match, is next to the crease. Pakistan have suffered the most ODI run-outs this year, three ahead of New Zealand, with daylight to the rest. Azam gets his sixth boundary, sending a full toss through the off side for four, and adds a late double with a dab down to third man.</p>

      <p>20th over: Pakistan 138-3 (Babar Azam 38, Malik 1) So it seems the answer to the Mohammed Hafeez problem is to give him plenty to swing at, and wait for him to get himself out. That was a lucky wicket for England, in truth, but Rashid and Ali have done well to restrict the batsman, edging the required run rate up. That's until Babar Azam, who is putting together an intelligent innings, crashes Rashid over extra cover for six.</p>

      <p>Oh dear. It's another one for the Allan Donald's Ridiculous Run-Outs DVD, as Hafeez pushes the ball in David Willey's direction, and with Azam unmoved at the other end, Hafeez is forced to trundle back, but is out of his crease by a good foot as Buttler clears the bails.</p>

      <p>18th over: Pakistan 128-2 (Hafeez 37, Babar Azam 29) Pakistan have bagged at least one boundary in each of the last seven overs. England's inexperienced attack getting a bit of a workout here, and it's Adil Rashid's turn to try and make the breakthrough. He almost gets it with a corking ball that drifts from middle stump, almost nicking Babar Azam's outside edge. Rashid does at least stem the flow of runs - four from the over.</p>

      <p>17th over: Pakistan 124-2 (Hafeez 36, Babar Azam 26) Moeen leaks just a single from the first four balls, after the players return from drinks. Pakistan have tended to wait for their chances, looking for a boundary or two per over to keep things moving. They get it, with Babar Azam tickling the final ball round the corner for a slow-motion four, with Willey chasing in vain.</p>

      <p>16th over: Pakistan 118-2 (Hafeez 35, Babar Azam 21) England, and Hales in particular, will be keen to get shot of Hafeez. Breaking this partnership, now 50 from 45 balls, is also a pressing concern. Babar Azam mistimes a cover drive but it drops short of the fielder, before Hafeez cracks another four with a pull through midwicket. Drinks!</p>

      <p>15th over: Pakistan 111-2 (Hafeez 30, Babar Azam 19) Someone in the crowd has a handwritten sign that reads '356 is chaseable; Pakistan are unpredictable'. Sanguine stuff. Hales is back on the field, but probably wishes he wasn't; after an exchange of singles, Hafeez swings for cow corner, and Hales gets right under it - but it falls through his fingers and dribbles away for four! That's a dolly, and Moeen in the middle looks furious.</p>

      <p>14th over: Pakistan 105-2 (Hafeez 25, Babar Azam 18) Hafeez has all day to set himself for a slow Topley ball, getting down on one knee and clubbing it into the crowd for six. Topley offers up a couple of wides as he struggles to find his range - and Babar Azam is on hand to offer more hurt, smacking another meek effort back down the ground. Topley on 0-32 after three overs, with Willey the only England bowler impressing.</p>

      <p>13th over: Pakistan 91-2 (Hafeez 18, Babar Azam 13) Time for a bit of Moeen magic, although the spell is broken immediately by Babar Azam, who crunches his first ball straight through the covers for four. The bowler offers little else in the over, with only a couple of sneaky singles - but the scoreboard keeps moving.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.12pm GMT</p>
      <p>12th over: Pakistan 84-2 (Hafeez 17, Babar Azam 7) Babar Azam runs a single, and has to coax Hafeez out of his crease. He's finding his groove when on strike though, and sends Woakes packing with a one-bounce four over mid on. Woakes has bowled four overs, with figures of 0-31.</p>

      <p>11th over: Pakistan 77-2 (Hafeez 12, Babar Azam 5) Willey is frustrating Hafeez here, forcing defensive shots when the batsman needs to come out swinging. He does find the fence with a wide, shorter ball that he sweeps awkwardly to fine leg. It was a better, more deliberate stroke than it looked. Willey doesn't learn, and Rashid has to move over smartly to stop an identical effort from reaching the boundary.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 4.04pm GMT</p>
      <p>10th over: Pakistan 68-2 (Hafeez 4, Babar Azam 4) Woakes, who has been expensive in his opening two overs, is helped out by Topley, who dives full-length to stop a mow through midwicket from Hafeez. Just three singles from the over. After ten overs, Pakistan's run rate is bang on track, but those two cheap wickets will mean England won't be panicking.</p>
      <p>"A fine start from Pakistan, but when the rate is more than seven an over to begin with it's a tall order" says Simon McMahon. "And when wickets fall (as they inevitably will) and the required rate edges up towards double figures, it becomes nigh on impossible. So, Pakistan to win by 6 wickets with 4 overs remaining?"</p>

      <p>9th over: Pakistan 68-2 (Hafeez 4, Babar Azam 4) Pakistan's shot of choice at present seems to be the nervous top edge just past the slips. Babar Azam gets a four in this fashion, with a slip and gully in place.</p>

      <p>WICKET! Azhar c &amp; b Willey 44</p>
      <p>An inauspicious end to what was becoming an excellent knock from Azhar. After spearing a top edge beyond Buttler for a fortunate four, he chips a slower ball straight back to Willey, who gathers it in and does that sinewy celebration of his, square in the captain's grill.</p>

      <p>8th over: Pakistan 60-1 (Azhar 40, Hafeez 4) Woakes has impressed in this series, but he's had a tough start here, with Azhar smashing an enormous six into the stands, then flicking a loose, wide delivery beyond Buttler for four. Azhar, clearly in the mood, nicks a single to keep the strike. England were 42-0 at this stage of their innings...</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 3.50pm GMT</p>
      <p>7th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Azhar 29, Hafeez 4) Here comes Mohammed Hafeez, who will need to stick around if Pakistan are to really threaten that England total.</p>
      <p>John Starbuck asks: "do England have a special Cunning Plan for him? And when that doesn't work (no plan survives contact with the enemy), how do they adapt to the circumstances?"</p>
      <p>There are worse ways to start than with David Willey, the only man to get Hafeez out in this series - but his first ball to Hafeez, a full, swinging delivery, is clipped nonchalantly away for four.</p>

      <p>WICKET! Shehzad c Ali b Willey 13</p>
      <p>The opening partnership is broken, and in routine fashion. Shehzad gets two off a scrappy pull to square leg, but after a chat with Morgan, Willey bangs in a short delivery, and Shehzad sends it straight into the arms of Ali at deep midwicket.</p>

      <p>6th over: Pakistan 43-0 (Azhar 29, Shehzad 11) Woakes comes in, with Morgan hoping to stem the steady flow of runs, but after a short ball causes confusion - and a half-chance at a run out with Azhar stumbling back to h is crease - the Pakistan captain punishes a couple of tame short balls. The first is dispatched over midwicket for six, the second driven through the off side for four more. An excellent start from Azhar.</p>

      <p>5th over: Pakistan 33-0 (Azhar 19, Shehzad 11) Chris Jordan is on the field, in place of Alex Hales. Not sure what the issue is with Hales, but it can't hurt to have Jordan in the field for a short while. An eventful over for James Taylor, as he gets hands to a fizzing, head-height blast from Shehzad, but can't reel it in. A tricky chance, and he makes amends next ball, racing to the rope to save a boundary and sending the tiny hoardings skittering all over the place.</p>

Pakistan struggling to pick out the holes in the England field, with a thump into the leg side from Azhar, and a carbon copy stroke from Shehzad, both finding a fielder. Azhar offers up a heave over mid on to finish the over with a four.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 3.28pm GMT</p>
      <p>3rd over: Pakistan 20-0 (Azhar 12, Shehzad 6) It's been a positive start from Pakistan's openers, with plenty of early runs needed to stop that target drifting into the distance. Azhar gets set to spank a short ball through the covers, but only finds James Taylor in the field. A handful of singles from a scrappy over.</p>
      <p>A good point well made, from Oliver Wilkes: "Well done Eoin for promoting Jos up the order. Please tell me that someone on TMS or Sky was chuntering away about how important it is for batsmen to know where they bat. Preferrably Boycs."</p>

      <p>Thanks John. That wasn't bad, was it? Jos Buttler has just scored the seventh fastest ODI century in history, behind only AB de Villiers, Corey Anderson, Shahid Afridi (x 2), Mark Boucher and Brian Lara.</p>
      <p>Buttler's knock was also, as you may have deduced, the fastest ODI century by an England player. Buttler has hit three centuries in all formats for England; all came in ODIs, and stand as the three fastest by an England player. When he's on, he's on.</p>
      <p>Of more immediate importance is the fine mess his century has left Pakistan in. England added 109 to their score in the final ten overs, setting Pakistan a target of 356; their record successful ODI run chase is a measly 328. Even England will struggle to mess this up from here.</p>

Buttler waits like coiled spring ... and Wahab sends five wides down the leg side. The bowler responds with a slower dot ball outside off but then gets it all wrong from then next with a nipple-high no ball outside off. Free hit: clipped into the gap at square leg for four.</p>
      <p>He crumps the next between the sweepers at long on and midwicket for four more. They skitter two off the penultimate ball of the innings. And the last is again squirted away for two.</p>

      <p>Buttler almost castles himself with a mis-hit ramp shot but a miserable delivery from Anwar disappears over the rope at midwicket. He moves to 90 from 43 balls. A very decent yorker is dug out for two. And it's six from the next! A full ball just jabbed back over the bowler's head and into the crowds. 98 off 45 ... and that's it. Six more! England's fastest ever ODI century: 104 from 46 balls. Utterly incredible, otherworldly batting from Jos Buttler. Batting from the future, from outer space.</p>

Four. The next, though, is skewed into the leg side ... but somehow drops between three fielders. Two more. And a single pings away off the stumps at the non-strikers end. Buttler is 16 runs short of what would be the fastest ODI hundred for England. And there are two overs left. Moeen, though, has pinched the strike from the last ball of the over.</p>

      <p>James Taylor, who has had the best seat in the house for this astonishing innings, finally gets to face a delivery and quite sensibly he takes a single to hand the strike back to the whirlwind at the other end. Out comes the ramp ... and there goes another boundary to bring up the England 300, a total no team has ever chased in the UAE. A yorker is dug out for a single.</p>
      <p>Taylor flails the next into the evening sky and is a fortunate to see the ball drop safe. Taylor misses with a wild swing from the fifth ball and from the last he picks out the man at long on.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 2.21pm GMT</p>
      <p>46th over: England 298-4 (Buttler 72, Taylor 10) Swing-and-a-miss from Buttler as Anwar Ali returns to the attack. But the next - an attempted bouncer - as swatted to square leg for four. Again Taylor turns a single into two from the next, and from the fourth ball of the over there's the most casual of reverse-sweeps (again with no foot movement necessary) for four more.</p>
      <p>The fifth ball of the over disappears into the stands at square leg for six. AND SO DOES THE LAST! It's a big full toss from Anwar Ali, and Buttler gets it over the rope via the fingertips of the square leg fielder. He has 72 from 36 balls. The partnership is now worth 71, of which Taylor has scored 10.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 2.14pm GMT</p>
      <p>45th over: England 276-4 (Buttler 50, Taylor 10) This is some shot from Jos Buttler - Wahab strays a touch short outside off and the batsman, feet barely moving, allows his hand-eye co-ordination to take over and slaps the ball baseball-style over extra cover and away for four. And he follows that up with something even better - a ferocious pull for six to cow corner. Buttler moves on to 47 from 27. Wahab responds with a clever slower ball, full and outside off. Smart stuff. Taylor turns a single off the next into two with some superb running and the last is a single that brings up Buttler's half century (from 30 balls) and allows him to keep the strike.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 2.10pm GMT</p>
      <p>44th over: England 262-4 (Buttler 37, Taylor 9) Buttler keeps his foot firmly on the gas, planting his foot down the track and biffing four to midwicket. From the next, he almost makes a mess of a ramp shot but adjusts at the last second and instead picks up four more despite the fine leg fielder's dive. Overthrows from the next and four more from the last, thanks to some Pretty Average fielding from Yasir on the point boundary. Fifteen from the over.</p>

A few balls later, the bowler attempts to bounce Taylor (which pretty much means he bowls on a good length) and the batsman sways out of the way, bringing his bat around as he does so to club a huge flat six to long leg.</p>

      <p>41st over: England 229-4 (Buttler 14, Taylor 1) The Taylor-Buttler axis back in harness, then. But this has been a brilliant little spell from the Pakistan captain: his figures read 4-0-17-2</p>

      <p>WICKET! Morgan st Sarfraz b Azhar 14 (England 227-4)</p>
      <p>Azhar, whose three overs thus far have gone for just 14, gets another wicket! Again it's a stumping, with Morgan the man caught out of his crease on this occasion. The England captain skipped down the track and missed the ball by a good distance.</p>

      <p>40th over: England 226-3 (Buttler 12, Morgan 14) Shoaib Malik returns. Six! Buttler thrashes Malik to cow corner with a slog-sweep. Two balls later, Morgan latches onto a short ball from Shoaib and carts into the space at midwicket for four more. And he repeats the trick from the last ball of the over. Sixteen from the over.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.47pm GMT</p>
      <p>39th over: England 210-3 (Buttler 5, Morgan 5) Azhar Ali continues. And England have to be satisfied with singles again, five of them in all.</p>

      <p>38th over: England 205-3 (Buttler 3, Morgan 2) Irfan returns and Morgan gets off the mark with a single. It's a good over from Irfan, though - just three runs from it.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.40pm GMT</p>
      <p>37th over: England 202-3 (Buttler 2, Morgan 0) That's Azhar Ali's first ODI wicket and it comes at a vital time for Pakistan. England's momentum has stalled a touch with those two dismissals. Root's 71 came off 71 balls.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.38pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Root st Sarfraz b Azhar 71 (England 201-3)</p>
      <p>Root rocks forward looking for the reverse-sweep but misses and Sarfraz removes the bails.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.35pm GMT</p>
      <p>36th over: England 196-2 (Buttler 1, Root 67) Jos Buttler, back in the batting groove, comes up the order. I really like the flexibility the England ODI team shows at the moment - wouldn't have happened a year ago. He gets off the mark with a single.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.33pm GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Roy c Babar b Yasir 102 (England 194-2)</p>
      <p>Roy has gone! A skip down the track and Yasir just tweaks the ball a touch wider. Roy ends up stretching for the ball and can only send it steepling into the outfield. Babar takes a comfortable catch and a fine innings comes to a disappointing end.</p>

      <p>35th over: England 193-1 (Roy 102, Root 65) Azhar Ali brings himself on for a twirl. A roll of the dice from the Pakistan captain. It's tidy enough in the end, with neither batsman wanting to throw their wicket away needlessly against the part-timer. Four from the over.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.27pm GMT</p>
      <p>34th over: England 189-1 (Roy 100, Root 63) Yasir Shah (8-0-50-0) comes back into the fray. Roy drives for a single to move on to 99 ... and brings up his first international century with another smart push through the covers. He had a slice of luck in the middle of the innings and he was briefly becalmed, but in general it has been a really fine knock. It comes off 113 balls.</p>

      <p>33rd over: England 185-1 (Roy 98, Root 61) England should be looking for 310- or 320-odd from here. A Root cut whistles past the man at point and flies away for four more. Wahab strays onto Roy's pads later in the over and, with fine leg up inside the circle, that's a straightforward four runs for the opener. The bowler responds well, with three successive dots to end the over. Even so, nine from it.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.16pm GMT</p>
      <p>32nd over: England 176-1 (Roy 94, Root 56) Shoaib continues and Root brilliantly finds the gap in the on-side field - four runs down to cow corner, the ball bouncing perhaps a yard inside the rope. Two balls later he goes to his half century with a mammoth straight six down the ground. What a shot that was.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.12pm GMT</p>
      <p>31st over: England 163-1 (Roy 93, Root 44) Wahab returns as Azhar Ali looks to find some control from his bowlers. And he gets it from the left-armer. Roy, who has a shirt now utterly drenched in sweat and under the helmet a face reddened by effort, is beaten twice outside off. Three from the over.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 1.06pm GMT</p>
      <p>30th over: England 160-1 (Roy 93, Root 41) Roy gets out the reverse-sweep again and confidently thumps Yasir to the point boundary for four runs that bring up the 100 partnership from 109 balls. And eight in total from the over.</p>

      <p>block-time published-time 1.01pm GMT</p>
      <p>28th over: England 146-1 (Roy 85, Root 34) Yasir Shah is having a pretty miserable time here. Six more from this over means his figures read 7-0-42-0. And his series figures to 26-0-150-1.</p>

      <p>27th over: England 140-1 (Roy 82, Root 33) Roy pushes Shoaib through the covers for three and England pick up five from the over.</p>
      <p>"I'm something of a Roy fan-boy, so this might come over a bit one-eyed, but I think it's far too early to consider dropping him," writes Michael Avery. "He's meant to be in the team to get things going quickly, to be attacking from the off to counter Hales' tendency to build slowly. Roy's stats before this match were 15 matches, 421 runs at a 32.38 average. By way of comparison, Aaron Finch after 15 marches had 484 runs at a 34.57 average. The comparison does falter slightly because by that point Finch did have a high score of 148 (against Scotland), but I think Roy will manage something similar given time (or similar opposition)."</p>
      <p>I don't think his place was under threat even before this knock. There's a definite commitment to the Hales/Roy combo at the top of the order (although it's true to say there have been definite commitments to opening pairings before ...)</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.53pm GMT</p>
      <p>26th over: England 135-1 (Roy 78, Root 32) Roy is beaten all ends up by Yasir Shah here, a big slog-sweep goes for four at fine leg courtesy of the outside edge. And he picks up two more off another outside edge. That prompts Pakistan to put a slip in - bolting the stable door once the horse has bolted? Um, no: Roy edges the next too but the ball flicks of Sarfraz's and the man at slip can only fumble the rebound down to the turf.</p>

      <p>25th over: England 124-1 (Roy 70, Root 29) Roy goes over the top for six! He dances down the track to Shoaib and lofts, rather than smashes, a drive back over the bowler's head - it plops a couple of yards over the boundary rope and the fielder at long on. This is more like it from this pair - reverse-sweeps and shovel-sweeps agogo.</p>

      <p>24th over: England 114-1 (Roy 63, Root 25) Roy swats a drive through the man at mid off for a single. And Root crashes the first six of the innings off the next, crunching a slog-sweep into the stands at cow corner. Yasir responds by firing a few in.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.43pm GMT</p>
      <p>23rd over: England 106-1 (Roy 62, Root 19) Three from Shoaib Malik's latest.</p>

      <p>22nd over: England 103-1 (Roy 60, Root 18) Yasir Shah again. More singles. This is just drifting a touch into 2014 England territory.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.36pm GMT</p>
      <p>21st over: England 98-1 (Roy 58, Root 16) Shoaib Malik comes in for a twirl. Five risk-free runs are added to the total.</p>
      <p>Rob Smyth has weighed in on the No10/opener question, pointing out that both Phil DeFreitas and David Brain have batted in both positions.</p>

      <p>20th over: England 93-1 (Roy 56, Root 12) Roy comes down the track at Yasir but the spinner, perhaps chastened by the six scoring shots played off his last over, has the batsman tied down for the first four balls of this over. From the fifth, though, Roy crashes a slog sweep to the midwicket boundary for four.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.27pm GMT</p>
      <p>19th over: England 88-1 (Roy 51, Root 12) Jason Roy brings up his half century (from 64 balls) with the latest of late cuts down to third man off Anwar Ali. He needed this innings - it turns a mixed series into a pretty good one.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.23pm GMT</p>
      <p>18th over: England 83-1 (Roy 47, Root 11) Yasir Shah continues. And England continue to rack up the singles - five in a row from the first five balls of the over, then Joe Root ruins everything by driving wide of extra cover for two from the last.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.19pm GMT</p>
      <p>17th over: England 76-1 (Roy 44, Root 7) Root clips Anwar Ali away for four, then cuts a little uppishly for a single. Quiet accumulation is the name of the game at the moment.</p>
      <p>"Afternoon John, afternoon everybody," writes Guy Hornsby. "This is rather serene progress but while we need to get in, the run rate isn't stellar, and another wicket would put us right in the proverbial (add a wicket when each goes down [/Boycott]). Anyone else getting a bit nervous? Roy's in need of a big score to just cement his place after some good starts, and Root's not scored big bar his 3 in the last game. A 3-1 would be an excellent result, 2-2 would feel like a missed chance. In short: PRESSURE"</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.12pm GMT</p>
      <p>16th over: England 72-1 (Roy 43, Root 4) A little later than expected, Yasir Shah enters the fray. Four dots ... and then a misfield allows Root a single.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.08pm GMT</p>
      <p>15th over: England 71-1 (Roy 43, Root 3) Still no spin from Pakistan - Anwar Ali returns. Roy is finding the gaps nicely now but three singles and three dots are all England get from the over.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.04pm GMT</p>
      <p>14th over: England 68-1 (Roy 42, Root 1) Irfan continues. Joe Root gets off the mark with a sweetly-timed pull for a single, Babar making a fine stop on the midwicket boundary to prevent four. Roy, though, beats the sweeper from the next with another superbly timed flick.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 12.00pm GMT</p>
      <p>13th over: England 62-1 (Roy 37, Root 0) Shot! Roy unfurls a glorious straight drive off Wahab - makers name, high elbow, the full works, with mushrooms and a fried slice.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.54am GMT</p>
      <p>12th over: England 57-1 (Roy 32, Root 0) Excellent stuff from Irfan, who has Roy squirting the ball just wide of gully. And he finds a bit of seam movement later in the over, jagging one past Root's outside edge.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.51am GMT</p>
      <p>WICKET! Hales c Shoaib Malik b Irfan 22 (England 54-1)</p>
      <p>Pakistan have the breakthrough. Irfan bangs one in a little shorter, and Hales looks to pull from outside off but can only get a toe-ended top edge onto the ball. Over the keeper and down to the boundary it goes, where Shoiab, running round from third man, takes a fine tumbling catch.</p>

      <p>11th over: England 54-0 (Roy 29, Hales 22) Wahab keeps things tight. Just three from the over.</p>
      <p>"With Broad, Finn and Wood to come back in ODI-wise, and Tymal Mills as an option, they should be just fine for the pace bowling options behind those playing today," writes Dominic Gillan. "Lessens our batting a touch replacing Woakes/Willey with them, but having Willey at 10 in this series almost seems a luxury too far! If we want Stokes as the sixth bowler on the other hand, not sure who to drop. Roy, with Willey opening?"</p>
      <p>Has anyone ever batted at No10 and opener in ODIs? Robert Croft certainly on occasion opened for Glamorgan in one-day games and batted a few times at No10 for England in ODIs, but I can't think of anyone off the top of my head who has completed that particular international double. Anyone?</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.44am GMT</p>
      <p>10th over: England 51-0 (Roy 28, Hales 20) Irfan has switched ends here and there's a stifled appeal as Roy is clumped on the pad - it pitched outside leg and was bouncing over so there wasn't much going for it. Roy miscues a drive over extra cover and picks up three, then chops away for a couple more to bring up the England 50. And the umpire has a quiet word with Irfan, whose follow-through is sneaking into the danger zone ...</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.39am GMT</p>
      <p>9th over: England 45-0 (Roy 25, Hales 17) Some fine shots in Wahab's latest but few runs, with both batsmen picking out the fielders.</p>

      <p>8th over: England 42-0 (Roy 23, Hales 16) Just to expand a little on Alex Bramble's email in the last over, an equally interesting selection puzzler comes when England play on surfaces that might require more than one out-and-out seamer. Would a pace attack of Topley, Willey, Woakes and Stokes be adequate at, say, The Oval next spring?</p>
      <p>Anyway, in the here and now Alex Hales has just crunched Anwar Ali away for four to backward square and England are building ( shudder ) a Really Good Platform.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.31am GMT</p>
      <p>7th over: England 36-0 (Roy 22, Hales 11) Wahab Riaz comes into the attack. Roy has a big slash outside off and another inside edge whistles past the wicketkeeper for four. He moves on to 22 from 26, with eight of those runs coming in the V behind him.</p>
      <p>"I have no desire whatsoever to dampen the entirely justified love for James Taylor, but watching him bat so well has got me pondering what happens when Stokes is fit?" frets Alex Bramble. "Does the axe fall on Taylor again, or one of the two openers, or Moeen, or Rashid?</p>
      <p>"I think newfangled ODI England were reluctant to select Taylor as they essentially saw him as the back-up No3, not wanting to select more than one accumulator ahead of more expansive stroke players - have to think of the brand and all. So when Root was rested for the ODIs against the Aussies, Taylor logically came in (and took his chance). They dodged the headache of how to fit him in for this series because Stokes got injured (which was something of a blessing - disguised or not - as they could play the extra batsman on these tracks and play Moeen as the all-rounder) but what about moving forward ?"</p>
      <p>The choice is probably between Moeen and Rashid once Stokes is fit again.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.25am GMT</p>
      <p>6th over: England 30-0 (Roy 17, Hales 10) Wonderful fielding from Ahmed Shehzad, who makes a brilliant stop at backward point to deny Roy a certain boundary. Ali drifts onto Hales' pads with the last and the batsman smites the half-volley away for four to backward square leg.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.21am GMT</p>
      <p>5th over: England 24-0 (Roy 16, Hales 5) Hales clips Irfan off his hip for two more. The bowler comes round the wicket as a result, but Roy as able to shovel wide of midwicket for a couple more. And there's a lovely little push down the ground for two more from the last. Nine from the over in risk-free ones and twos.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.17am GMT</p>
      <p>4th over: England 15-0 (Roy 11, Hales 2) The first boundary of the day - Roy attempting a cover drive and getting a thick inside edge that whistles away to fine leg for four. The only runs of another sharp over from Anwar Ali.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.18am GMT</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.13am GMT</p>
      <p>3rd over: England 11-0 (Roy 7, Hales 2) Roy turns Irfan round the corner for two more. The bowler is finding an awkward length, though. It's nudge and nurdle from England so far and that's because they've been forced to be cautious by some excellent bowling.</p>
      <p>"This is the most comfortable I've been with England's middle order in a long time," writes Shola Clarke. "Root, Morgan and Taylor I have confidence in every time they walk to the crease. I don't think I've ever felt this way before." It's a strange feeling isn't it? Like seeing a hammer float in the bath or a donkey playing canasta.</p>

      <p>2nd over: England 6-0 (Roy 3, Hales 1) Rizwan misfields to allow Roy another single as Anwar Ali begins his first over. Hales gets off the mark with a risky single - a direct hit from midwicket might well have seen him run out.</p>
      <p>"In honour of James Taylor playing so well, are you gonna post us a bit of music?" writes Paul from Finland. " This for example ?"</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 11.03am GMT</p>
      <p>1st over: England 2-0 (Roy 1, Hales 0) JJ Roy could do with a few runs here - it's been a mixed bag of a series for him so far (and a mixed bag of an ODI career for him so far, in truth). Mohammad Irfan starts with the ball for Pakistan and immediately wangs one down the leg side. Roy cracks a couple off the back foot straight to the cover fielder but then picks up the first runs off the bat with a little dab down to third man.</p>

      <p>Preamble</p>
      <p>Hello all. I don't know about you, but I'm still reeling from Thursday's announcement of the Test squad to tour South Africa. Whither Ian Ronald Bell ? It was probably time for the Sledgehammer of Eternal Justice to be put out to pasture but still. I suppose we'll always have 2013.</p>
      <p>But the man set to take over the mantle as England's Most Aesthetically Pleasing Diminutive Middle Order Batsmen is in stunning form out in the UAE. James Taylor is busy chiselling out a role in the side for years to come and due in no small part to the Notts batsman, England now stand on the cusp of a series victory.</p>
      <p>The momentum is all theirs - they have now won seven of their last eight ODIs against Pakistan, with that one defeat coming in the opening fixture in this series. The XI is settled, in contrast to Pakistan, and there is a certain swagger about the side.</p>

      <p>The shots are not quite as loud as you might expect them to be, but still they are too close for comfort. The bullets fly past the head of a shocked Territorial Army soldier and embed themselves in the wall, just inches from where he is standing. A sharp voice shouts: iContact to our left, three or four rounds.i Seconds later, there is a small burst of fire.</p>
      <p>They call it a contact and what it means is that somebody, somewhere, shot at British troops. It happens every single day in Iraq. Today they think it might be a warning that they have stayed in this area for too long, but in truth they really don't know. It is one of the first forays British soldiers have made into the town of Amara, north of Basra, for quite a while and the locals aren't happy. On the wall of a nearby community centre, a scrawl in red paint reads: iDawn No No USA Brtish (sic)i.</p>
      <p>This group of 12 Territorial Army soldiers from 52 Lowland Regiment Y Company have been escorting a man from the Ministry of Defence to another British-built community centre. The civil servant n known as a political adviser, or ipoladi for short n has flown up from Basra to check that British government funds are being properly spent. Colour Sergeant Keith Irving from Hawick in the Scottish Borders is in charge of this expedition, and is standing on a street outside the community centre, watching for possible trouble, his SA80 rifle at the ready. He is surrounded by dozens of cheeky-faced children shouting, iMister, mister, Saddam donkey,i while showing him the soles of their feet. But as the convoy pulls off later, the children's faces turn resentful and they start throwing stones.</p>
      <p>It's just another day for the Territorial Army soldiers serving in Iraq n people who, most of the time, live daily lives every bit as ordinary and banal as yours or mine, but who find themselves, in times of war, called upon to do an extraordinary second job in a very dangerous place. The mobilisation of reservists for the war in Iraq was the biggest since the Suez Crisis, and it continues to grow through the postwar phase. There are 1,210 Territorial Army soldiers serving on Op Telic 4, as the current operation in Iraq is known, making up 14% of the 8,069-strong British force. Roughly 10% of the TA contingent are female, many of them nurses.</p>
      <p>As the British army has come to rely ever more heavily on part-time soldiers, the contrast between the jobs they do at home and what they do in itheatrei, as the military call the Iraqi conflict zone, has become more striking than ever. There is the Calor Gas tanker driver who is currently gathering intelligence; the joiner who runs a job creation scheme for Iraqi people; the marketing officer for the National Archive at Kew who now spends his days trying to liaise with public service officials; as well as the mechanics, plumbers and City analysts doing guard duty. Then there are those on a busman's holiday of sorts: the two electricity specialists working on the Basra power grid; the doctors and nurses working in the military field hospital; the chefs now preparing meals for thousands of soldiers stationed in the desert.</p>
      <p>The soldiers from 52nd Lowland Regiment have spent most of their time in Iraq on force protection, interspersed with what they consider the more boring job n guard duty. They are coming to the end of their six-month stint in Amara and their morale is still pretty high. At home, they belong to various TA units, training in their different bases in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Ayr and other towns across Scotland during the week, coming together as a brigade at periodic short residential camps. While they may have met each other's wives and families at dances and other TA events, they don't like to talk about home too much.</p>
      <p>Irving, the broad-accented Scotsman, is typical of the TA soldiers here in that he believes that he is just as professional as any regular in the field. He served in the regulars for five years, then signed up with the TA 10 years after leaving the forces. iHaving seen it from both sides of the fence, I think commitment-wise the TA guy is the better soldier,i he says. We are standing outside a British-funded blacksmith's shop. Inside, the owner is telling the MoD man that he is now employing five members of his family because of the funds he received to kit out his workshop. The MoD man is happy, even though this marks just a small success in terms of the British attempt to help rebuild the country.</p>
      <p>Outside on the street there is a perception that the tension is mounting. The road is busy with cars and bicycles and people, all of them staring: most don't look particularly friendly. It's not the numbers on the street you need to worry about, says Irving, it's when the crowd suddenly disappears that you know something might go wrong. I ask him if he ever gets scared. He shrugs his shoulders and quips: iWit's for ye will no go by ye,i a fatalistic Scottish expression which means whatever happens happens. In his other life, Irving delivers medical oxygen across the Borders of Scotland.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Another day, another scene. It is just past 7am and a watery sun is burning a hazy white light across the flat landscape that British soldiers have taken to calling the iGifai. Territorial army fusilier Michael Greville explains that it means the igreat Iraqi fuck alli.</p>
      <p>Greville is 26, and usually works as a credit analyst for Cazenove, a city investment bank. It's an office-bound job and most days he finds himself by a computer. In Iraq, when he is not soldiering, he goes back to his accommodation to study his notes for the chartered financial analyst exam which he hopes to take next year: iWhen I am really bored, which is pretty much 12 hours a day when we are not working, I go back to my room and study.i Being here means he is missing out on his city bonuses, but Greville is enjoying the tour anyway.</p>
      <p>This morning some of Four Platoon from Messines Company, the London Regiment, are on their way north, escorting three vehicles from the British divisional headquarters at Basra airbase to the Dutch army camp near the town of Samawa, south of the flashpoint city of Najaf. Like 52 Lowland, they provide armed escort and covering fire should the convoy of regular troops meet any insurgency on the road.</p>
      <p>They may work alongside the regulars, but ultimately all the TA soldiers in Iraq are under the command of the British Forces General Officer Commanding Major General Rollo, who is a regular soldier. Those serving with Messines Company are led by a TA Major Conrad Giles whilst those attached to a regular regiment such as the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment take orders from a regular commanding officer. The TA frequently provides protection for regular soldiers who are not fighting on the frontline but who have to move around southern Iraq. In such situations the regular soldier must obey the TA unit's senior ranking soldier.</p>
      <p>In this instance it is Colour Sergeant Rob Denman, and he is calling out orders through the radio to the two guys in each of the vehicles whose heads are sticking out through a hole in the roof to provide covering fire. They are known as itop coveri and find themselves in one of the most exposed situations of all the military n a number of the recent deaths and injuries in Iraq amongst British troops were of soldiers doing top cover.</p>
      <p>Up top, one soldier faces the front and another the back, one with an SA80, one with a Minimi light machine gun, both looking for a possible threat. They cautiously keep their eyes open for snipers, mortar teams, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) and the particularly lethal improvised explosive devices, IEDs, that can be left on the side of the road and detonated some distance away by remote control. If the convoy stops or slows for too long, they must dismount and try to move the traffic on while at the same time watching out for potential assaults. The rebels in the south have yet to use the suicide car bombs seen in Baghdad, but the soldiers are anxious that they soon could.</p>
      <p>iJust so you are aware, there's one pax (person) standing up on that flatbed coming towards us,i says Denman. iAs we move up the MSR (main supply route) make sure the vehicles are tight. I don't want no civvies in between us.i The previous night, another Messines Company force protection team was the target of an RPG, which shot through the gap between two of their vehicles. They need to stay close.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed the Colourman because of his rank, Denman is 37 and works as a principal officer at Wandsworth prison. An hour and a half outside of Basra, he spots a cloud of black smoke up ahead. He tells the boys to approach slowly. They soon realise it's a traffic accident involving a Dutch military vehicle and a local car.</p>
      <p>Three Iraqis have died in the accident (the casualties were quickly removed by locals), but the Dutch soldiers have been standing by the side of the road for a while apparently doing nothing to police the situation. iMaybe they are in shock,i says Denman. He jumps down from his wagon and orders his soldiers to enact the drill they have trained for to deal with this situation. Denman starts to set up a vehicle checkpoint and control the traffic; the rest of the guys are sent to guard the peripheral area. An hour and a half later, the Dutch iquick reaction forcei arrives and he can stand his men down. iIt's not very quick, the quick reaction force, is it?i someone pipes up. iYesh, we have just come from Camp Shpliffy,i cracks another. The Dutch, whose camp is called Smitty, are the butt of a lot of British jokes.</p>
      <p>Denman calls his boys ithe PlayStation generationi because iall they can use is their thumbsi, but really, he admits, iI think they are the mutts' nuts because they bring all their outside experience to the job n and today they showed that the TA can do the same job as the regular army.i</p>
      <p>In the team n as well as the prison officer, the nurse, and the City boy n are: Lance Corporal Ander Broadman, 30, who procures engineering works for Network Rail and missed out on a vital promotion by being in Iraq; private Ed Elliott, nicknamed Billy (as in Billy Elliott), who works for JP Morgan Fleming in the city and ilikes this sort of stuff, it's a break from delays on the Northern Line and fixing the photocopieri; Private Tom Kelly, nicknamed Forceps because of the shape of his skull, who drives a HGV lorry for the Post Office; Dean iDeanoi Moore, a shaven-headed joker of a joiner from Belfast; and Private Tim iWatesyi Wates, a recently-redundant recruitment consultant who joined the TA ito shoot stuff. Not people, but to shoot off weapons, the feel, the sound, the power, there's a huge adrenalin rush: it's boys' toysi.</p>
      <p>Pace, who could have been a medic in the TA but preferred to join the infantry, says: iIt's like training for a football match and wanting to play. I didn't want to train and just use blanks in a forest somewhere. We do use live rounds when we are training sometimes in the UK but there's a different apprehension about it.i Wates pipes in: iThat's what gives it the edge, you know there are people out there wanting to kill you.i</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Britain has a long history of reserve forces, with Volunteer and Yeomanry units being formed during the Napoleonic wars. The TA was established in 1907. First known as the Territorial Force, it encouraged Britons to join in ihomeland defencei: the word territorial signified that those who served with the force were under no obligation to serve overseas. By 1921 it had changed its name to the Territorial Army. In the first world war, a number TA units volunteered to go to war and did not come back for four years, bringing back 71 Victoria Crosses for bravery.</p>
      <p>With the abolition of national service and the advent of the cold war, it seemed the TA's role was assured, but with the fall of the iron curtain, the security of the homeland was deemed to be under rather less of a threat. The Conservatives cut TA numbers by 15,000 between 1991 and 1994, then the present government scythed the numbers further from 54,000 to 41,000 as part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review. The then defence secretary George Robertson said: iThe TA should no longer be a force of last resort, held against a major conventional threat to the UK and Nato allies. More units will be placed at significantly higher states of readiness. And we will now be prepared to call them up n in formed units if needs be n in situations that fall short of a direct threat to the UK such as the Gulf war.i This would, he added, give them a imore heavyweight rolei. The 40,000-strong TA now forms 25% of the British army, and can be called on to provide the army with entire formed units, or to supply individual specialists as required in IT, logistics, medicine, communications and other areas.</p>
      <p>Almost all of them, while essentially volunteers, have been compulsorily mobilised (the MoD calls it iintelligent mobilisationi, insisting that it accommodates people who can prove it would be impossible for them to go for professional or personal reasons). The Reserve Forces Act 1996 obliges all employers to keep a TA soldier's job open but some have returned from Iraq to find this isn't the case. At least 17 are believed to be taking their former employers to tribunals after losing their jobs upon their return.</p>
      <p>Compared to the training undergone by regular soldiers, the territorials' induction can seem light. Soldiers attend training on three evenings each month , and commit themselves to one Sunday a month, and six weekends and two full weeks camp a year, which they must take out of their annual work leave. For these hours they are paid the same as a regular soldier of equivalent rank, ranging from £29.10 a day for a private to £102.51 for a major. Each year they are awarded a tax-free bounty of between £350 and £1,380 depending on length of service and on passing an annual battlefield weapons and fitness test. While they are mobilised, their salaries from their employers are suspended. The theory goes that a TA soldier on active service will be no worse off than he or she would be at home but sometimes this doesn't work out: a City trader can't expect to get his or her bonuses, but will get their mortgage and other ireasonablei outgoings covered.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, the iTerriesi take a ribbing from both civilians and the regular army for iplayingi at being soldiers, a dads' army of weekend warriors. The comedian Jack Dee recently described members of the TA as ipart-time soldier, full-time banging on about iti, while the best-known fictional TA member, Gareth from the Office, never lets his own service go forgotten: iA lot of people think that the Territorial Army are not real soldiers. We are. We are well trained, highly disciplined fighting machines ready for war. We're just not available during the week.i</p>
      <p>iUntil the TA changes their courses to six weeks like the regular army we will never be seen as the same as them,i says one soldier from 52nd Lowland. iBut it takes them six weeks to do a course that takes us two weeks because they are not as brainy as us. That's why when regular guys leave the army the best job they can get is as a security adviser. But TA guys are different.i In addition, the concept of rank can work rather differently with the territorials. Often, highly qualified civilians prefer to remain privates in what they see as a break from responsibility. Better educated, white-collar professionals often find themselves taking orders from someone who comes from a blue-collar background.</p>
      <p>Certainly there can be a marked difference in culture between regular and territorial units. Last year, I was embedded with a squadron of regular soldiers during the invasion of Iraq. Spending time with the TA in a similar situation, it seemed to me that the diversity and breadth of experience that these men and women had gained in their normal daily lives gave them more interesting things to talk about than their regular counterparts n and a rather different view of their involvement in the conflict. Most had signed up for the TA out of a sense of patriotism and duty, but they are far from army machines; as one, who had copies of The Spanish Civil War and The Rise and Fall of the British Empire by his bed, told me: iI am a historian and I suppose I am in love with the romanticism of it all.i Another did not believe the war was justified but enjoyed the adventure of it.</p>
      <p>Denman has been in the TA for 14 years n ipromoted and demoted a couple of timesi n and got his call-up papers for Iraq in January 2004. It was a blow to his wife Sandy and his two children, Amy, 11, and James, 7, but he has worked every other weekend as a prison officer so he is used to missing key family moments. He has gone on exercise to Estonia, Germany, Cyprus and Romania, but Iraq is his first proper tour of duty. With a few qualms, he says, he would be happy to come back for another. iIt's given me an outlet physically, getting out and not being surrounded by walls, a feeling of not being hemmed in.</p>
      <p>Like other soldiers, Denman has his own opinion about the war, but out here considers it irrelevant. iI look at it the same way I do in the prison service: I am paid by society to carry out a task. I am paid to be a prison officer and to lawfully detain people and out here I am paid to be a soldier and follow the orders of my commanding officer and carry out foreign policy.i</p>
      <p>His worst day in Iraq, he says, was when he went to the field hospital at Shaiba Logistics Base and saw a 22-year-old private from his company being fed through a straw. He had received a shrapnel wound in his throat when an IED exploded under his vehicle. iBecause I am a platoon sergeant I feel really, really responsible,i says Denman. iIn a way you are a father figure; I feel responsible for my blokes. When you have been through all the training and the camaraderie and you see someone you don't want to see hurt hurt it makes you angry.i</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>This kind of attack has become more frequent in the British-controlled south since August, when Moqtada al-Sadr declared a holy war on British troops. It is now very rare to see British soldiers on the ground in their soft berets, a style of dress that was much trumpeted by the MoD in the days immediately after the war. The British claim they still have 90% of public consent, but it doesn't seem like that on the ground.</p>
      <p>The battle group further north in Amara, for instance, has been under the most sustained attack of any British unit since the Korean war, with 881 mortar rounds being fired at them since April. It is estimated that the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment has fired 30,000 rounds of ammunition, more than was used by all troops in the invasion phase last year. In August, the former family home of the governor of Maysan province used by the British as the headquarters of their civil and military cooperation unit (known as iCimic Housei) came under siege; during one 10-day period, 428 mortars were fired at it. The 100 or so soldiers there n a high percentage of them TA n had to sit and battle it out.</p>
      <p>Hanging out in the humid, malodorous tent that is their home in Abu Naji camp, five miles outside Amara city centre, some of Colour Sergeant Irving's ijocksi (as the infantry privates in the 52 Lowland are known) recall the three-week battle of Cimic House. One soldier filmed the engagement: the camera tracks red tracer fire as it thrashes across the sky towards the building and then back out in returning fire. The subtitles count the 595 mortars, 10% of which landed within the perimeter: 57 RPG attacks, five 107mm rocket attacks and 86 small arms engagements.</p>
      <p>iI wouldn't say it was horrific,i says Fusilier Derek Currie. iIt was mad. A mortar knocked our sanger (an elevated guard post on the edge of camp) and deafened me for 8? hours.i Currie is 21 and from Glasgow. In his normal life he works with children in after-school care: iI do training, I do workshops with new employers, I organise sports days.i Private David McCauley, 29, works in a call centre for the Manpower employment agency. iIt's not scary at the time but you sit down after and go, oh God, that was a bit hairy.i</p>
      <p>But a boy with chipmunk teeth pipes up that it's ibrillianti. Private Craig Hardie is 24 and a mechanic from Kelso, and he loves all this. He joined the TA 18 months ago, around the time of the fall of Saddam Hussein. Having trained in battlefield first aid he is the team medic, and the boys have stuck the label iwitch doctori above his campbed. This kind of engagement, he says, is iwhat we join the TA fori.</p>
      <p>But however much it may seem to some like a great game, these boys, unlike many of the territorials in Iraq, have killed people. They know it should bother them, but at the time, when the killing was done, it just didn't. iThey shoot first: it's them or us,i says McCauley. iI would rather go home and see my two kids. If you slot someone, they are usually quite a distance away, so surprisingly, when you see them fall over, it doesn't really affect you that much since they were firing at us first.i</p>
      <p>They say they are not worrying now about post-traumatic stress, or the many other psychological scars they may carry back to nine-to-five civilian lives. iMost of us here will be OK because we talk to each other about it,i says McCauley. iI have been (nearby) when a mortar has hit a civilian's house and the first thing I have heard is a woman screaming, a sound you would never want to hear. I might not forget that.i</p>
      <p>Later, a regular soldier tells me a story about being at Cimic House. iI was on top of the Pink Palace with Keith (Irving) and we were crouched behind a really low parapet. I was shitting myself. I was on my belt buckle (lying down). And Keith's up there with his rifle mounted over the parapet, bullets whizzing past him on either side and he's looking at me going: eWhen your time's up you time's up.'i He adds admiringly: iAnd he's in the TA.i Irving is not much of a stickler for ranks and titles. He and his sergeant Gordon Wylie, a plumber affectionately known as iWee Speccyi, believe that it is good for morale for the men to talk to each other like friends.</p>
      <p>That night, at 1am, a loud bang, followed by a dull thud, shudders the ground on the eastern perimeter. Ten 107mm rockets n ia beast of a munitioni, says Irving n have landed and detonated. They are met by outgoing rounds from a Warrior tank. Just another contact, but this time the assault is much more sustained and it comes as a shock to TA Corporal Lisa Lovell, who is in the Royal Military Police. Sitting up in bed, a worried look on her face, she tells me that this is the most scared she has felt on her tour. She is a solicitor from Newcastle and thinks this fear may be because her time here is coming to an end. The soldiers believe that this is statistically the time when something bad might happen to them because they are apt to let their guard down.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>Last month, the British moved out of Cimic House and handed it back to the Iraqis. Much of the work they were doing is now carried out from a cabin they call Cimic Hut that sits at the gates of Abu Naji; trips out of base are now very limited. On a table inside the hut sits a thick green file with the words iCompensation Claimsi written on its spine. Sergeant William Cooper is looking at a photograph of a hole made in a wall by an RPG. A local woman, Jinan Salman Mohammed, hands over a photocopy of her identity card and a form which says, in English: iMy house was bombed during the events between Al-Sadr militias and British forces by shelling by British army.i In a box she details the damage and how much she reckons it will cost to build again. iAir conditioning, $ 400, bricks $ 250, sink and paint and glasses and basin with valves and mixer, $ 140, cement and sand, $ 300. Total: $ 1,340 US.i</p>
      <p>Cooper says it seems a pretty fair assessment n isometimes, for damage to buildings they are trying for $ 10,000i n but says it is not clear who is to blame. iA lot of them bring these claims but they are not really sure who fired. We are trying to tell them that if we do fire any rockets or missiles it is all regulated and documented and we will know if it was us.i In the past week they have had 30 claims for rocket damage.</p>
      <p>Sitting beside him, Lance Corporal Dougie Telford, a swimming pool lifeguard from Motherwell, is looking at a set of photographs showing damage to a car and getting angry. iI saw this photograph yesterday with another claimant. Fuck off. I want other pictures, I want a court report.i The young man's claim for damages astounds him. iAn air conditioning unit for $ 6,372. You can build a house for $ 2,500 and you are trying to claim $ 6,372.i The boy laughs when he hears the interpreter's translation. They add the claim to the pile.</p>
      <p>Later, Telford holds up an x-ray and says: iThis is a compensation claim. The person says they have been hit by shrapnel.i In the middle of the negative is a distinctive foreign body lodged in the gut. iLook, it's a bloody safety pin.i</p>
      <p>Today, a frustrated crowd of 350 men have been hanging around since dawn. This assembly has been going on for a few days now, since the rumour spread that they were hiring people at the camp and recruiting for the new Iraqi police force. It's not true, but still the desperate turn up; an enterprising man hunkers down on his knees beside the crate of cola he has hauled for miles to sell to them. Lack of jobs is probably the most serious issue in Amara. iThe pot is starting to boil again and it is all about unemployment,i predicts one intelligence officer.</p>
      <p>Several soldiers tell me they are enjoying their time in Iraq, but many members of the TA detest their assignments. One senior regular officer admits that the TA very often get the less exciting jobs, particularly the monotonous guard duty, day in day out. This is because his men n the ireal soldiersi he slips, before quickly correcting himself with iregular soldiersi n are career soldiers who have to think about promotion and the jobs they have to do in order to secure it.</p>
      <p>Nor are the conditions in which they are serving in any way hospitable. Abu Naji is the worst of the British camps in terms of living conditions: there isn't much to do here apart from be a soldier. There are no TV lounges or bars like the other camps, and no air conditioning in the junior ranks' cookhouse. In the height of summer the fetid 60 degree air is thick with flies.</p>
      <p>Corporal Malcolm iBeachyi Grieve is a 43-year-old slaughterman whose daily life involves cutting through animal carcasses in an abattoir in Selkirk in the Scottish Borders. He was mobilised in February and is extremely unhappy in Abu Naji. He joined the TA 14 years ago, he says, ito be part of a team and get the extra coin, it was good money at the timein and until Iraq he loved it. This is his first deployment and, apart from the TA annual two-week camp, the first time he has been away from his family. His wife Theresa was ivery upset and didn't want me to gang (go)i. A small man with a large paunch and decorously tattooed arms, he has been assigned to stores and so instead of soldiering he is gofering: iI go for coffee, I go for salmon, I go for corned beef.i</p>
      <p>Sitting in the Portakabin-type accommodation that he shares with Telford and Cooper, he says he was originally brought out as a driver of what are called iwhite fleeti vehicles, unarmed 4X4s. But the situation in the Amara area has since escalated, and the white fleet never go out any more. Hence the gofering.</p>
      <p>iFor the first three months we were battered from pillar to post n guards, convoys, whatever they could fit us into n which was a bit of a disappointment because I would rather have gone back to my own company. Really, I thought they had nothing for us to do. If anybody said to me, eWhat do you think of the tour?' I would say it's been the biggest waste of nine months of my life, because I have never done anything constructive to help the Iraqis.i</p>
      <p>Beachy's other big complaint, aside from boredom, is money. He is missing out on his bonuses and funds at home are tight. iNaturally, working in a slaughterhouse, there's no need for the wife to buy butcher meat and that. With four bairns that's quite a lot of money. Every job has got its perks but the army doesn't appreciate that.i He asked to get back home in October so that he could be back at work in time to earn some money for Christmas. TA soldiers are allowed 40 days leave upon their return but many, like Beachy, can't afford to take it.</p>
      <p>Then there's what he sees as the lack of support for his wife. iI'm lucky because I have a big family around about my wife but there has been no information or support for her. I think the army should help them, the wives have not got a clue. What does the wife do if she's got depression or that?i</p>
      <p>This operation, he says, iis going to kill the TA. They just won't get people to do it any more. An employer sets up a factory to make money, he cannae afford to train up a man and lose him. I think if you are going for a job interview and it says on your CV that you are in the TA then you will go to the bottom of the pile.i</p>
      <p>But in spite of his grievances, he is still proud of his role: iMy friends think I am stupid coming across here, because they think it is only for one thing, oil. Me, I think you have got to put something back in to the Terries. You took the slagging that you were Saturday and Sunday troops, but how can your friends turn round and say that now? It won't be ehere's the weekend warrior coming' now.i</p>
      <p>Over in the 75-bed field hospital at Shaiba Log Base, commander Martin Deahl of 256 (City of London) Field Hospital is on his second tour of duty with the TA since the invasion of Iraq. He has been promoted from his job last year as a psychiatrist to commanding the whole of the medical operation. He is 48 and says it's an adventure at his age. iI've done some extraordinary things my colleagues would never dream of. They have poked fun at me about this for many years because psychiatrists as a group are a fairly anti-establishment bunch.i</p>
      <p>Conditions are more comfortable than his assignment last year, he says, but the security situation is much more dangerous. iThis hospital gets rockets fired at it every two days. Thank God none of the tents have been hit yet but if it was it would go up in flames very, very quickly. This is much more challenging work than last year. There are soldiers who come through here who should have been fatality statistics and have survived n really miraculously.i</p>
      <p>This kind of experience really enhances the skills of a jobbing NHS medic, he says, ibecause they have to improvise. It also makes you put life into perspective, when you back to work and find colleagues arguing about the coffee money or what kind of biscuits they are going to get in the morning it makes you realise how superficial and trivial a lot of things are. It teaches you to appreciate creature comforts. Although it's intangible I think the employers get someone better from the experience back afterwards.i</p>
      <p>In the past two decades, the British army has seen almost all of its medical services cut and it now relies enormously on TA soldiers from the NHS in times of need. But that reserve of people available continues to get smaller and Deahl acknowledges that it will soon reach crisis point. He says: iThe Medical service is getting close to running out of personnel already.i</p>
      <p>By the door to the A&amp;E entrance of the hospital, a senior nurse muses that 40-plus casualties who have been delivered alive since the middle of August have all lived. The following morning, two British soldiers doing top cover jumped down to help their colleagues after the vehicle in front was hit by an RPG. As they ran, they were both hit by small arms fire. Gunner David Lawrence, 25, and Corporal Marc Taylor, 27, both serving with the 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, died from their injuries at Shaiba.</p>
      <p>Denman and his crew had been travelling down the same road only the day before. In an email, he told me last week: iThe mood has been a little sombre around here of late, but the lads keep cracking on as usual, the usual stiff upper lip stuff that we as Brits are good at.i He signed it iFaugh a Ballaughi, an old Irish battle cry meaning iClear the way.i</p>

      <title>g2: Whodunnit: The last snowfall: In this original short story by Nicholas Blincoe, the body of a woman is found - and then lost - in the snow in an isolated Alaskan community. Can you solve our wintry whodunnit? Answer on page 12</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Every fortnight when I make my mail flight up to Ambler Bay, I look forward to visiting old Hildie. All the folks up at Ambler are fine by me, but when I deliver Hildie's mail, I'm not just doing my job - I'm exercising a genuine pleasure. Hildie keeps a moonshine still, way back in the pine trees of her 50-acre spread. This trip, though, Hildie was so overwrought she forgot her manners and pounced on the mail packet without offering me a drink. She found the envelope from the photo lab in Anchorage and ripped it open, saying, "Now those guys'll have to believe me."</p>
      <p>A glance at the photograph showed Hildie was telling the truth two weeks ago when she handed me the film. As she had predicted, the picture showed a body lying in the snow, beyond the chain-link fence that the oil company had erected around its drilling site. Hildie was right about something else, too. This was a genuine mystery. The woman was lying between two great pines in the middle of an expanse of fresh snow. There were no tracks leading to her body, save the pockmarks of a prowling dog and the holes made by snow fallen from the branches above. There was no snow on the woman, not even a dusting, so the only way she could have got there was if she had fallen from the sky.</p>
      <p>Yet this wasn't as far-fetched as it might sound. The arrival of the oil company had also brought eco-warriors up from Seattle. The activists were intent on scaling the trees around the drilling site and this woman was likely one of them, a protester who had fallen from her perch. If that cleared up half the mystery, it didn't explain the rest of Hildie's story.</p>
      <p>Hildie is in her 70s and none too lissom. Rather than scrape through a gap in the chain-link fence to get to the body, she went home to radio for help. Unfortunately, she was out of methanol and her generator was dry, so the radio wouldn't work. I told her she should have filled the generator with moonshine, and she said she wished she had thought of that - the woman might still be alive. Instead, she locked up her dog, Betsy, and drove to the sheriff's office in Ambler, taking the photo on the way. By the time the sheriff and Hildie returned to the site, the body was gone and a fresh fall of snow left no traces as to how she might have disappeared. With no body, there was no mystery. As the sheriff said at the time, who knew but the woman hadn't simply got up and wandered away? Now I had seen Hildie's photographs, I knew this was impossible. Dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt, the woman would have died of hypothermia in half an hour.</p>
      <p>Hildie asked, "Do you recognise her?"</p>
      <p>I couldn't say I did, but these eco-warriors prefer to travel by sea rather than take my mail flight up from Anchorage. The boys who came with me were Hildie's sworn enemies: oilmen. On this trip, I had flown out 10 big guys; no doubt hired to cut the eco-warriors out of the trees and maybe throw a scare into them. I apologised to Hildie for this, but she knows I don't get to pick and choose my passengers.</p>
      <p>Hildie had lived the simple life in Ambler for more than 40 years and she had no intention of selling up. She was even doing her bit for the protesters, allowing them to set up a base camp on her land. When I saw their camp on my last trip, I thought, that makes sense of the letters Hildie had been receiving from Seattle over the past year. She and the eco-warriors may have been in cahoots but Hildie was in a minority of one around Ambler. Everyone else would have welcomed an offer from the oil company - but only Hildie owned land in the right vicinity.</p>
      <p>After I left Hildie, I recognised one of the protesters, a youngster named Ben Abbott. I still felt guilty for flying up the oil company toughs, so I said hello and warned him the compound fence had been strengthened. It wouldn't be so easy for him to break in and scale the trees. In Hildie's photograph, the fence had been in poor shape, with holes cut out and a few strands of colourful nylon thread snagged on the wire where a protester must have snuck through. Ben thanked me for the information but told me that he and his partner planned to make rope walkways so they could flit from tree to tree. I wished him good luck, and worried that we might see another body on the ground before springtime.</p>
      <p>As we were talking, Betsy bounded up and jumped all over Ben. He had clearly made a firm friend. Ben laughed, telling me that he had no idea what kind of reception he would get up in Ambler, but Betsy had made the trip worthwhile. As Hildie always said, Betsy was the smartest dog in the world.</p>
      <p>Once the sheriff saw Hildie's picture, he wasted no time calling in Frank Tanner, the watchman for the oil company. It wasn't the sheriff's style to move fast, but what I didn't know until I inveigled my way into his office was that he already had a body. The dead woman had been found in a ravine on the far side of Ambler, about 30 miles from the drilling site, which was no distance in such a spread-out community. There was no doubt that this was the woman in Hildie's photograph: she was wearing the same dark jeans and sweats. The sheriff showed Tanner the picture and told him, "This has to be embarrassing, Frank - a dead woman on your shift." Tanner claimed he didn't know a thing but the sheriff threw a curve-ball and said he'd found Frank's tyre tracks around the ravine. There had been more than two feet of snow since the photo was taken, but Tanner was none too bright, and soon admitted to dumping the body. But he swore blind he had not killed her. Like the sheriff said, he was just saving himself and the oil company the grief of a dead eco-warrior on the site. Later, I asked the sheriff if he believed Tanner's story. The sheriff shrugged, but said once he got the forensic report, he would call the witnesses together and figure out the story.</p>
      <p>Things move slowly in Ambler. I flew the woman's body down to Anchorage for the autopsy and I was back by the time the sheriff got the results. Tanner was still in the sheriff's cell but the forensic report went some way to supporting his story: the woman had died of hypothermia, not trauma. She was about 40 years old and part Yupik, the native tribe in those parts. The Yupik claimed no one from their tribe was missing. I figured, if none of them knew the dead woman, maybe she was the illegitimate daughter of one of the old boys. The sheriff thought that sounded right.</p>
      <p>The sheriff had four possible witnesses. Frank Tanner, of course. Ben Abbott and the other eco-warrior, his girlfriend, Flossie Jones. And finally, old Hildie. I was there, too, and I had to admire the professional set-up. The sheriff had wired up a projector so that we all sat in the half-light, looking at Hildie's photograph blown up on the office wall. Now I saw the photograph so big, I wondered about the faint swirling pattern in the snow, leading away from the woman's body. Hildie was more excited by the tail end of a rope, visible in one of the trees. Flossie and Ben had claimed they had made a start scaling a tree before the weather drove them back to camp. When Hildie said she had seen Frank Tanner cutting down the ropes the next day, he had called her a liar. The photograph clearly showed that Tanner was the liar.</p>
      <p>Ben asked the sheriff if the woman showed signs of having fallen from a height. The sheriff said there was nothing conclusive: she had cuts and bruises but no broken bones. Hildie pointed out that the snow was deep enough to have cushioned a fall. Flossie wondered if the dead woman could have got her injuries fall ing through the brambles into the ravine where she had been found. The sheriff asked how she knew about the brambles, but the girl refused to be trapped: she'd gone along to look at the crime scene after the news came out. The sheriff seemed to accept this. At any rate, he told us that the postmortem proved the woman was alive when she got her cuts and grazes and dead before she entered the ravine.</p>
      <p>What else could he tell us? The dead woman had sailed up from Seattle on a fishing boat. Ben and Flossie were adamant they had never seen her before, but the sheriff said she fitted the eco-warrior profile: she had arrests for drink, drugs and vagrancy. This time, he got a reaction . . . from Hildie. She told the sheriff he ought to be ashamed of himself, casting aspersions on two good kids. Hildie so identified with the eco-warriors, she had taken to dressing like them, though her jacket was a lurid, tatty ski jacket rather than the mountaineering jackets the kids could afford. Once the sheriff had calmed everyone down, he admitted that the crew of the fishing boat reported that the dead woman sounded more like a prospector than a protester: prowling the deck in all weathers, wrapped in an old pink anorak as she bragged about a fortune waiting for her in Ambler. The crewmen wrote her off as a fantasist, a damaged woman who was getting on in life and getting desperate.</p>
      <p>I said, "However she died, she must have been drunk, stumbling around in the snow or falling out of trees."</p>
      <p>"I don't know if she was drunk," the sheriff replied. "I can tell you she was blind. And that's the problem. I think we've got a murder inquiry on our hands."</p>
      <p>I nodded sadly. "I think so too, sheriff" *</p>

      <title>Germany 1-5 England: 15 years on World Cup qualifier is still music to ears of many</title>
      <subtitle>On 1 September 2001 England secured an extraordinary win in Munich. A song about Sven-Goran Eriksson captured the moment - but some of his victorious squad did not realise the game's impact at the time</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Martin Bell remembers the evening of 1 September 2001 better than most. He and his musical partner, Johnny Spurling, had written a song about the newish England manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson, which had received some airplay on TalkSport before the pair went abroad in late August. "We went to Spain to do some gigs and when we got back, suddenly everyone's on the phone," Bell says. "It never stopped ringing. We did some interviews on the Friday, then the match was on the Saturday. It was all geared up: if we beat Germany the Sven song was going to go through the roof."</p>

      <p>On the Saturday night they played a corporate event in Essex. "We did the first set and people already knew the song because it had been on the radio that week. Then we had a break and everyone stopped to watch the game. It was an amazing night," he says. "When Gerrard scored I remember me and Johnny diving across the floor like Jürgen Klinsmann. We did a second set and ended up doing four encores of Sven at this corporate gig. It was hilarious. The next day Capital Radio put out a version with Jonathan Pearce's match commentary mixed in and it was everywhere. On the Monday we had seven major labels all bidding for us. It was just a mental time. There was this Svenmania. It's only a football song but it captured a moment. It's something that everyone somehow remembers."</p>
      <p>Events in the US ensured that September 2001 was not the most auspicious time to release novelty comedy singles but, even so, Bell's and Spurling's Sven Sven Sven song entered the charts at No7 and earned them a slot on Top of the Pops. Fifteen years later the very idea of Svenmania sounds absurd but it was born of unusual circumstances and a single result that verged on the miraculous.</p>
      <p>England had endured a miserable European Championship in 2000, losing 3-2 to Romania and Portugal to go out in the group stage, but they did at least beat Germany, who appeared to be in even more of a shambles as the two countries prepared to go head to head again in qualifying for the 2002 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Germany had got rid of Erich Ribbeck, the coach who brought them such disappointment at the European Championship, and appointed Rudi Völler as a stopgap while they waited for Leverkusen's Christoph Daum to become available the following summer. However, when the in-demand Daum's predilection for cocaine-fuelled sex parties was reported and the hair sample he submitted in an attempt to clear his name turned out positive instead, he ended up with no job at all, fleeing to the US on a one-way ticket to let the controversy die down (he is now manager of Romania).</p>
      <p>Paul Breitner, a World Cup winner in 1974, called it "the biggest scandal in the history of German football", and it was unfolding while Germany prepared to play England in October 2000, the last game at the old Wembley Stadium. Low on confidence and surrounded by scandal, there could be no better time to play them.</p>
      <p>The game ended with David Beckham in tears and Kevin Keegan announcing his resignation as England manager to the Football Association's David Davies in a toilet cubicle, Dietmar Hamann having scored the only goal in the 14th minute. Now both teams were in chaos. Roy Hodgson, who had recently taken over at Copenhagen, and Terry Venables, who was at a loose end 18 months after an acrimonious end to his second spell at Crystal Palace, were discussed, and Howard Wilkinson and Peter Taylor each had a single game in caretaker charge, before for the first time the FA decided that no Englishman was up to the task.</p>
      <p>Instead, it revealed in October 2000 the appointment would be Sven-Goran Eriksson, a Swede who had won Serie A with Lazio that year. Five wins and a solitary friendly defeat later England approached their second qualifying game against Germany in a mood of relative optimism, even if they were six points behind their opponents in the race for the single automatic qualifying place, with a game in hand and time running out.</p>
      <p>History was not on their side. England had never won a competitive match in Germany and Germany - West Germany before unification - had only ever lost one World Cup qualifier, out of 61 played, and that was a dead rubber played away from home. Before the game the defender Jens Nowotny insisted that "Eriksson and the English are too experienced" to even do much attacking.</p>
      <p>Michael Owen also left the stadium with the match ball, which he carried in a black bin liner</p>
      <p>"They're not dreaming of scoring lots of goals against us," he said. "England will be defence-orientated at first and play coolly and calmly." The Bayern Munich captain, Stefan Effenberg, an interested observer having retired from international football, said: "I can't see England getting any kind of result in Munich."</p>
      <p>He added: "The game is much more important for England than it is for us. They will come here knowing that if they lose then it's over for them in terms of the group. That may affect their play. Germany will play freely."</p>
      <p>That was certainly how they started. The giant striker Carsten Jancker, who had once been rejected by Luton Town after a trial, put the home side ahead in the sixth minute, and although Michael Owen equalised in short order Germany should have retaken the lead, only for an unmarked Sebastian Deisler to skew wide from 10 yards. "When Germany went ahead I was thinking: 'This could be difficult,'" Eriksson said. "But the players kept their belief and started to play good football. The crucial moment in the whole game was that miss by Deisler. If he had scored - and he should have - they would have gone in ahead at half-time."</p>
      <p>Germany may still have done so but for an excellent save from David Seaman to keep out Jörg Böhme's low drive as the game entered stoppage time. Moments later England won a free-kick near the right-hand corner flag, from which Beckham's cross was headed back into the path of Steven Gerrard, who with the last kick of the half slammed a low shot into the corner of the net from 25 yards. "I remember us getting a set piece, it was cleared, got put back in and was cleared out," Gerrard said. "I remember thinking to myself: 'Just get a good touch on it, try and set it for a strike on goal.' My touch was perfect for once and I got fantastic contact - the pitch was wet and I put enough power on it to slide past a top keeper in Oliver Kahn."</p>
      <p>Kahn certainly did not feel like a top keeper on this occasion, later declaring that "we might as well have had my gym bag in goal" as it "would have kept out a couple of the shots I let in", while on the BBC Mark Lawrenson dubbed him Oliver Can't at half-time. Owen remembers that England "bounced into the dressing room" at the interval as "we had a feeling by now that this was our night". One long-time team-mate had never seen the striker so excited. "I remember the atmosphere in the dressing room at half-time," said Jamie Carragher, a substitute who came on in the second half. "Michael Owen was really wound up, to an extent that I'd never seen from him before. He had the scent of blood and knew we would take Germany apart in the second half if we did the right things. He was operating at the top of his game that night. He was unstoppable."</p>
      <p>Owen wrote: "I played three or four games in my career when absolutely everything clicked, everyone had confidence and every chance we got we scored. This was one of them. We felt fantastic. That game was one of those freaks when everything we touched turned to gold." Owen scored again three minutes into the second half - the first four goals of the game were all set up by smart, controlled knockdowns, with Emile Heskey claiming this assist - and completed his hat-trick in the 66th minute after being released by Gerrard. Heskey scored the last with 16 minutes remaining, the first of the three goals he managed in 36 competitive internationals. " 5-1 - and even Heskey scored," roared the English fans.</p>
      <p>Völler's father had suffered a heart attack while watching the game, so the Germany coach left the stadium immediately after the final whistle. "There was no detailed analysis with the manager after the match," Hamann wrote in 2012. "He returned to the hotel while we were having our meal. We talked a bit about the game but it was gone and our minds turned to what we had to do to get to the finals. So an episode that went down in the history books of English football hardly registered in the psyche of the German players."</p>
      <p>Well, he would say that. Some of his team-mates, speaking with the game fresher in their memories, clearly found the result harder to shrug off. Kahn, for one, described it as "a catastrophe" that would leave him "scarred for life". "The impact of this is like what we call a Super-GAU, a nuclear explosion," he said. "There is no shame in losing to England but there is when you lose like that. After the first goal we could not stand their pressure. We showed a lot of indecision and could not stop them. We could not stop Owen. He was so cool and clinical."</p>
      <p>The defender Christian Wörns, who was substituted at half-time, announced a short-lived retirement from football. "Everyone thinks I'm the guilty man for what Owen did to us," he said. "I wasn't even on the pitch in the second half when he scored two goals, so others should be taking the blame. The whole nation has been slaughtering me and making out I'm the one to blame for our downfall. Because of that I'm not in the mood to play any more football for the national team."</p>
      <p>In fact, it was the England players who did not have the obvious reaction to the result. Rio Ferdinand said he "didn't realise the euphoria that surrounded it until we got back to England and everyone was going mad" - and he was not alone. "Everyone said to me afterwards that it must have been buzzing in the dressing room but it wasn't," Nick Barmby said. "For a while, we just sat down and said to ourselves: 'Did that just happen? Did we just beat Germany 5-1 on their own turf?' To be honest, it was just surreal."</p>
      <p>Owen swapped shirts with Böhme after the final whistle and had returned to the dressing room before he realised quite what an impact the game might have, leading to him seeking out his former team-mate Christian Ziege and making him get the shirt back. Owen also left the stadium with the match ball, which he carried in a black bin liner. He would not always look after it so carelessly: six months later he was reported to have installed a £10,000 alarm system in his home specifically to protect it.</p>
      <p>Svenmania was also breaking out in the manager's native Sweden, where the match was watched by 1.14 million people, more than twice as many as Sweden's own game against Macedonia, which took place at the same time. Sport-loving Swedes also had the rival temptation of the annual athletics meeting against Finland to contend with that evening. "I watched all of them," said the then prime minister, Goran Persson, "and we won all three." Meanwhile in England Marks &amp; Spencer printed 9,000 Germany 1 England 5 T-shirts, and they sold out in a day. "I can't remember a menswear product selling so well," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Naturally I am very happy," said Eriksson, a few days after the game. "There is a lot of enthusiasm about the team. I am happy reading the papers, listening to the radio and TV, but I want us to be heroes like that at the end of June. It was an excellent performance but it was just one small step to reach the top of the scale and it is always important to remember that."</p>

      <p>It was as high up the scale as his England team ever got. Four days later they laboured to an unconvincing 2-0 win over Albania, and in their final qualifier the following month they needed a glorious stoppage-time free-kick from Beckham to salvage the draw they needed to qualify for the World Cup, where they lost to Brazil in the quarter-finals. Germany, meanwhile, regrouped. "Those were the hardest days in my career, I had never been under so much pressure," Völler said "but that's when the team grew together, when we created this spirit we have." Having beaten Ukraine in a qualifying play-off they got all the way to the final in Japan, where they, too, lost to Brazil. In the three World Cups since, Germany have finished third, third and first, thrashing England 4-1 in Bloemfontein in 2010.</p>
      <p>For England's captain that night in Munich the match remains a career highlight. "Beating the Germans in Germany and the way we beat them was incredible," Beckham said. "I think about that game almost every day." Beckham remains - at least until Wayne Rooney overtakes him by turning out against Slovakia on Sunday - England's most-capped outfield player. All of Germany's 10 most-capped outfield players have won the World Cup and all of the top 29 have played in at least one final. England's superiority may have been fleeting but it was fabulous.</p>

      <title>Weekend: FLIGHT TO THE DEATH: Just two months after 9/11, a Queens suburb suffered the second-worst plane crash in US history. Five years on, residents tell Gary Younge, the cause remains worryingly unresolved</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Father Michael Geraghty thought things were winding down by early November 2001. The previous two months had been intensely traumatic for his parish in Belle Harbor, Queens. He had lost 12 of his flock in the September 11 attacks - six were working in the twin towers, another six were firefighters who had gone in to try to save them. "In our particular parish we were having masses and memorials constantly at that time," Geraghty says. "It was a difficult process following the World Trade Centre because families had to begin grieving without knowing for sure if their loved ones were dead - identifying the missing took so long."</p>
      <p>The last of the memorials was on Friday November 9. "I did feel in one way that one chapter of the sadness was over," he says.</p>
      <p>On Monday Geraghty went to work at St Francis de Sales church on this peninsula that hangs on to New York by a thread, perching precariously out into the Atlantic, and started to try to recreate some sort of normality. At around 9.18am he was at the altar celebrating mass when he felt "a tremendous vibration". "I could feel it in my legs. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was something bad. I thought it was another terrorist attack." A young woman ran in and said there was a fire at the end of the street. Geraghty dismissed the congregation. "I told them, 'It's time to go home and find your loved ones.' Planes were weapons in those days."</p>
      <p>Just a few blocks away, American Airlines flight 587 had fallen from the sky a few minutes after taking off from nearby John F Kennedy airport on its way to Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic. One engine fell on the intersection of Beach and 128th; the other on the petrol station at Beach and 129th. The fuselage descended on Beach and 131st. The Rockaway community was back in mourning. All 260 passengers and crew on board perished, along with five people on the ground. It was the second-deadliest aviation disaster in American history. A government investigation has ruled out terrorism but, five years on, many of the victims' relatives, pilots and at least one congressman remain unconvinced.</p>
      <p>As Geraghty rushed out to view the blaze in Queens, Belkis Lora was at JFK hoping for the best. She had dropped off her brother, Jose, a couple of hours earlier. Belkis works at JFK for American Airlines and had secured her brother a standby ticket. Jose used to live in New York but had moved back to the Dominican Republic a few years earlier. One of nine, he was the only boy and had come back to the US for a christening. As Belkis drove him up to the airport, they chatted about his plans for Christmas. "I told him not to forget that he had to come for Christmas, because if he didn't I would come to Santo Domingo to get him," she says.</p>
      <p>It was a full flight, so Belkis kept an eye out to make sure Jose would get on. "He was the second from last to get a seat," she says.</p>
      <p>"This is his lucky day," one of her colleagues had said. "He's got into first class."</p>
      <p>Minutes later came news that a flight had gone down in Queens. But still, Belkis thought her brother really had been lucky. "They said it was a flight from Santo Domingo, not to Santo Domingo. I believed them. When you think that something bad has happened, you think it must be to someone else."</p>
      <p>As Geraghty rushed out to survey the damage, Belkis was reassuring her family - they called to ask her if Jose was on the flight. She told them he was not. Then, as they stood transfixed in front of the tele vision, a pilot came into the work room and said it was flight 587. The bottom fell out of Belkis's world. Her voice quivers and her tears fall as she recalls the moment she realised that Jose had died.</p>
      <p>Back in Rockaway, Geraghty looked on, stunned, as the emergency services moved into gear. Rockaway is home to large numbers of firefighters. Those who were off duty and worked elsewhere knew how to operate the equipment, and rushed out in the clothes they had on to help quell the flames. Meanwhile, since it was only two months since September 11, the security services were on alert. "It was unbelievable," Geraghty recalls. "By 11 o'clock they had transformed an empty hall into an operations centre. In less than two hours there were 50 desks with 50 phone lines on them. By 1pm they were feeding the firefighters."</p>
      <p>Preliminary investigations soon scotched the fear that the crash was an act of terrorism. Three years later, the National Transport Safety Board released a report blaming pilot error as the probable cause.</p>
      <p>Flight 587 had taken off at 9.15am, shortly after a Boeing 747 that had created considerable turbulence in its wake. According to the NTSB, the American Airlines co-pilot, Sten Molin, 34, had responded to this turbulence over-aggressively. His "unnecessary and excessive" use of the rudder had caused the plane's tail to fall off, said investigators. The rudder, which is rarely used, swung back and forth four times in 7.5 seconds, the report said. The NTSB also slammed Airbus Industrie, which manufactured the plane, insisting that the rudder design was a contributing factor in the crash as well as the airline's pilot-training programme, which encouraged the use of the rudder in such situations.</p>
      <p>While the board agreed that the co-pilot was at fault, it split 3-2 over whether the rudder design or the pilot training was more important in the crash, deciding ultimately that the rudder design had a greater impact. According to the NTSB, Molin had been cited twice by senior pilots for "overreacting" over wake turbulence.</p>
      <p>But many believe the verdict was wrong. Some claim Airbus had been reluctant to share all it knew about design flaws with the rudder system and that investigators should have probed more deeply. "How is safety served," American Airlines spokesman Bruce Hicks asked the Fort Worth Star-Telegram after the report was released, "how is future aviation safety enhanced by blaming the pilot, who had no way of knowing the design sensitivities of that airplane because Airbus, who did know, never told safety investigators, never told operators and never told pilots all it knew about the system's problems?"</p>
      <p>Airbus denied any wrongdoing. "We made</p>
      <p>a good-faith effort to communicate everything that we knew," said the company's spokesman. "We do not believe the facts of the investigation point to sensitivity of the rudder as contributing to the accident."</p>
      <p>A month after the NTSB report came out, a New York congressman, Anthony Weiner, said all the parties had a share in the negligence and introduced the Flight 587 Accountability Act. Weiner pointed out that in 1997, Flight 903, another American Airlines Airbus, almost lost its tail fin in almost identical circumstances. Yet in the four years between the two flights, argued Weiner, not Airbus, nor the airline, nor the Federal Aviation Authority had acted.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a Canadian plane with a similar rudder design had to return to a Cuban airport shortly after take-off when its rudder broke, prompting the American pilots' union to call for the investigation into flight 587 to be reopened. "We're just trying to renew the interest and concerns about these particular model aircraft," Captain Bob Tamburini, a member of the American Airlines pilots' union, told the Daily News. "We are requesting that the National Transportation Safety Board reopen its investigation based on the information that came out as of late."</p>
      <p>Belkis Lora believes there has been a cover-up. "These planes have a problem with their rudder," she insists. "And we don't want more people to die like this. The families of 9/11 know what happened to their loved ones. We don't. But it was not the pilot's fault. If it's not the aircraft, then maybe it was sabotage. I still think there was a good chance that terrorism was involved." This is a common view among Dominicans, for which there is little evidence. But time and again people shrug and ask in disbelief: "How does a plane just fall out of the sky?"</p>
      <p>Washington Heights, at the northernmost tip of Manhattan, is home to the largest concentration of Dominicans in the US; the Rockaways, making up a narrow peninsula way to the south, in Queens, are populated by Jewish, Irish and Italian-Americans; the two communities have long been linked by Duke Ellington's famous "A" train. The two-hour ride from one to the other takes you 30 miles through just about everything New York has to offer: through Harlem, the trendy-wealthy Upper East Side, Chelsea, the West Village, the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, Bedford-Stuyvesant and then on into Queens and finally to Belle Harbor, where the sea surrounds you, every stop begins with the word Beach and the journey ends.</p>
      <p>In the bodegas and bustling streets of Washington Heights, Spanish is spoken and English understood. This has become the first resting place for many new Dominican immigrants, somewhere they can network and stay with family. "People come here and find cheap housing," Monsignor Gerard Walsh of St Elizabeth's Roman Catholic Church in Washington Heights told the Los Angeles Times shortly after the crash. "It's close to jobs downtown and they get a good education and get out, hopefully."</p>
      <p>Ninety per cent of those on the plane were of Dominican extraction. Flight 587 had acquired something of a cult status in Washington Heights. "Every Dominican in New York has either taken that flight or knows someone who has," Belkis Lora says. "It gets you there early. At home there are songs about it."</p>
      <p>At the far end of the subway line stand the two-storey wood-framed houses of the white working class. Cops and firefighters refer to the Belle Harbor area as Rockapulco, where happiness is defined</p>
      <p>as "never getting the sand out of your shoes". "It's impossible to understand unless you live here," says Kathy Blum, 31. "Everybody's Irish or Jewish, or married to someone who is."</p>
      <p>"It's one of those neighbourhoods where people grew up in the house that their father grew up in," Geraghty says. "It isn't unusual to find four generations have lived in the same house." In the aftermath of the crash, he bought two huge Dominican flags to hang around the church and 100 small Dominican and American flags for local children to hold when the families of those who died came to Rockaway - to try to make them feel at home in their grief. Up in Washington Heights, makeshift memorials sprang up all over the neighbourhood. Now those two communities were joined by loss.</p>
      <p>In Belle Harbor, an elderly couple, Thomas and Helen Concannon, were killed in their home. A couple of blocks away, Gerry Pomponio thought her hairdryer had blown a fuse until she realised a plane had struck the front of her house, crushing the upstairs bedroom where her husband Franco was sleeping and blocking the front door. Gerry grabbed her teenage daughter, Jennifer, and got out through the back door. Franco died. Kathleen Lawler and her son were the other Rockaway victims.</p>
      <p>The houses on the two blocks where one of the engines and the fuselage landed have been completely rebuilt. New redbrick buildings and buffed white paving slabs bring cosmetic relief to the scars.</p>
      <p>On flight 587, myriad immigrant stories of hope foundered. On board was Hilda Yolanda Mayol, 26, a waitress who had escaped from the north tower of the World Trade Centre and was heading to the Dominican Republic with her mother and children to take her mind off the trauma.</p>
      <p>Ana Made, 85, was finally leaving the South Bronx for her native Nizao after she was confined to a wheelchair. "Life was too difficult in the Bronx, and here (in the Dominican Republic) she had her community and her family," her daughter-in-law, Alba Mercedes Perez, told Newsday. Not wanting his mother to travel alone in a wheelchair, her 52-year-old son had travelled with her.</p>
      <p>And then there was 38-year-old Tito Bautista, who changed his flight at least three times to accommodate the shift patterns of the two jobs he worked at. He was heading to the Dominican Republic to collect his son and bring him back to New York, where he hoped he could give him a better education.</p>
      <p>And there was the family of five from Washington Heights that suddenly became the family of two after Roberto Despradel perished with his sons Lorenzo and Robert, leaving behind just his wife Ylsa and their six-year-old daughter Gabriella. "The pain is too much. I cry and I cry," she said. "But I need to be strong for my little girl."</p>
      <p>Back in Belle Harbor, which remains under one of Kennedy's flight paths, residents cast a wary eye overhead every time they hear a roar. "Is that a good plane or a bad plane?" children ask their parents. Says Father Geraghty, "We don't know what to say." i</p>

      <title>The anonymous op-ed writer is just another Trump enabler - not a rebel</title>
      <subtitle>Resignation in protest has an honorable history. But the author's refusal to step outside the White House shows they want the benefits of being inside with the acclaim</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Donald Trump's mentor, Roy Cohn, may have been the inspiration for the president's obsession with treason. As the president said in mid-2017, referring incorrectly to Cohn's first big case: "You know what treason is? That's Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving [the Soviet Union] the atom bomb." The Rosenbergs were actually convicted of espionage in 1951 and executed in 1953, with Cohn whispering in the judge's ear on an almost daily basis.</p>
      <p>But Trump, with his crackerjack legal mind, apparently believes that everyone who crosses him is guilty of treason. Referring to the New York Times in a Thursday night interview for (naturally) Fox &amp; Friends, Trump said: "The Times should never have done that. What they've done, virtually it's treason."</p>
      <p>The Times' sin, which might justify a firing squad if Trump were judge and jury, was to publish the confessions of an anonymous "senior official" in the administration. An odd amalgam of a hostage video and a samizdat manifesto, the op- ed heard round the world warned that Trump "is detrimental to the health of our republic". And yet it also bizarrely insisted "there are bright spots that the near ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture".</p>
      <p>What was equally revealing, though, was the accompanying bylined drawing (Delcan &amp; Company) that showed a map of America, pivoting on the tip of Texas, that is being saved from toppling off a cliff by four brave men and women straining at a rope. The imagery, about as a subtle as Soviet realism, was a reference to the op-ed's paean to the "unsung heroes in and around the White House" who are bravely serving as the "adults in the room".</p>
      <p>This reflects the great Washington illusion that there are indispensable officials in a dangerously misguided or lawless administration. It was why Vietnam critic George Ball, undersecretary of state and UN ambassador for Lyndon Johnson, loyally served a president he sometimes privately scorned. The same pattern repeated itself in 2003 with then secretary of state Colin Powell's feckless internal opposition to launching the Iraq war without major international backing.</p>
      <p>Resignation in protest has an honorable history in American life dating back to former secretary of state William Jennings Bryan stepping down in 1915 because he opposed Woodrow Wilson's efforts to orchestrate the nation's entry into the first world war. But the towering examples are Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus, who resigned after refusing to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox in Richard Nixon's 1973 "Saturday night massacre".</p>
      <p>It is telling that the op-ed's author refused to step outside the gates of the White House to reveal all that he or she knows</p>
      <p>It is telling that the op-ed's author refused to step outside the gates of the White House to reveal all that he or she knows about an "erratic" president with "anti-democratic" values. The issue is not that the senior official is "GUTLESS", as Trump tweeted, but rather that Anonymous wants all the benefits of being inside coupled with the acclaim for a self-depiction as a courageous rebel.</p>
      <p>Gary Cohn, Trump's first White House economic adviser, operated with a similar two-faced approach. Rather than loudly resigning over the president's tolerance for bigotry in Charlottesville, Cohn stayed on in hopes of being named chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>Sure, as Bob Woodward reveals in his new book Fear, Cohn repeatedly crept into the Oval Office to snatch papers off the president's desk to prevent Trump from precipitously withdrawing from trade treaties. (It is tempting to picture Cohn dressed in all black like a cat burglar.) But, in a democracy, Cohn probably should have instead resigned and used his clout to appeal to Congress to curtail Trump's trade authority.</p>
      <p>Now Washington, obsessed with the identity of the duplicitous "senior official", is hunting the mole with far greater avidity than the British chased Kim Philby. An amusing aspect is that the news media appears to be taking seriously denials from the likes of Mike Pence. Or that many reporters believe that an analysis of the prose style of the op-ed will reveal the identity, even though many "senior officials" never write anything longer than an email themselves.</p>
      <p>Until proven otherwise, I assume that the Times ' pen pal is someone who believes that, even at this late date, he or she can still wriggle back to a position of respectability in Washington. And, yes, the record of Nixon alumni suggests that such rehabilitation might be possible.</p>
      <p>But, until late in Watergate, Nixon managed to separate his genuine policy achievements (from creating the Environmental Protection Agency to the opening to China) from his lawless, paranoid side. In contrast, Trump in the White House, judging from both Woodward and the Times op-ed, is the same arrogant, ignorant and cruel termagant who displayed all his ugly impulses daily on television in 2016.</p>
      <p>Everybody who entered the Trump administration in a senior role knew the itinerary of the cruise that they were embarking on. That's why the so-called "adults" on deck are more Trump's enablers than they are heroic mariners guiding the ship through shark-filled waters.</p>

      <title>Little Vera review - nudity and sex behind the iron curtain</title>
      <subtitle>Made in the final years of the Soviet Union, the sensational tale of a sexually voracious teenager was the key perestroika movie</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>'I see a big beautiful Soviet feeling being born here ..." This is what a teenage poet called Lenka gleefully announces when she realises that her friend Vera is in love. She is the little Vera of the title, which can ambiguously mean "a little faith" or "little faith". The feeling that's being born isn't particularly big or or even very Soviet. But it might be beautiful.</p>
      <p>The 1988 film Little Vera - to be revived in London - was a commercial hit, helped by its startling amount of nudity and sex. It was a triumph for its director Vasili Pichul and screenwriter Mariya Khmelik, who was Pichul's wife, quickly renowned as the key perestroika movie, whose openness to westernised thrills of sex and rock'n'roll (no drugs, though) made it a key text of the times.</p>
      <p>Vera, played by Natalya Negoda, is a liberated teenager, who has trendy makeup and hairstyle in the style of Debbie Harry, and takes a frank and uncomplicated pleasure in sex. She is rebelling against her parents, and against the stultifying non-expectations they have of her life beyond high school. And she is most importantly rebelling against the men in her life: against her grumpy, alcoholic dad (Yuri Nazarov), who flies into ugly, anti-Semitic rages when he has had a few, against her clingy, dull boyfriend Andrei (Andrei Fomin) about to do his military service and self-pityingly preoccupied with the fact that they haven't had sex, and also against her pompous and self-satisfied brother Viktor (Alexander Alexeyev-Negreba), who left to be a doctor in Moscow and has now been summoned back to the family home to talk some sense into his little sister because her parents feel she has gone off the rails. She is even in a kind of rebellion against the man she falls in love with: Viktor's friend, the swaggeringly handsome and sexy Sergei (Andrei Sokolov) who starts to take her for granted.</p>
      <p>What sort of film is Little Vera? Thirty years on from its original release, it's possible to see how it is not so much a harbinger of the future but a revival of a certain type of European film from 20 years in the past, perhaps the last great social realist movie of the classic kind, something to be compared with Ken Loach's Poor Cow, or Tony Richardson's A Taste of Honey, or even Ingmar Bergman's Summer With Monika. It's a film in which the passion and vividness of the female lead is in contrast - and even at war - with the poverty and frustration that is all about.</p>
      <p>We see Vera hanging out with her various dodgy friends at a kind of illegal open-air disco, which degenerates into violence. She has already become vaguely involved with a friend's scheme for illegal currency conversion involving a stolen US $20 bill. It is here that she meets Sergei, feels the instant spark and has sex with him. This is happening in an era when Russia was as concerned with sexual health as the west, though with a more candidly homophobic attitude. Vera thoughtfully reads from a leaflet pinned up in Sergei's tatty student room: "What you should know about Aids ... Avoid casual sexual relations and contacts with homosexuals."</p>
      <p>In the pre-pill era, female sexual pleasure would be punished with the dreadful spectre of pregnancy. Pichul and Khmelik create a new twist on this classic social-realist disaster. Vera merely pretends that she is pregnant - to panic her parents into accepting her relationship with Sergei. That lie is a kind of aphrodisiac for them. They talk about it while they are having sex, and it is a kind of comforting risk-free illusion that cements their sensual intimacy.</p>
      <p>But Sergei is far from happy and is catastrophically rude to her parents, which is an intimately painful insult to her dad, poor drunk Kolia. Vera was once the apple of his eye. Wheedlingly, pathetically, Kolia will ask bored Vera: "Remember how you used to put me to bed when you were little?" He means of course when he was too drunk to make it there on his own. It's a sentimental, cloying memory that falls just short of abuse.</p>
      <p>There are some extraordinary black-comic scenes in Little Vera. An extended sequence has Vera quarrelling with her friend Lenka (Alexandra Tabakova), who like Kolia is hurt that all Vera's emotions are now engaged with Sergei. Finally, Christyakova gets up and demonstrates the "ha" posture that she has learned in yoga, stretching her arms in the air and throwing herself down to the ground. "Like this, we cleanse ourselves of psychic poison!"</p>
      <p>Little Vera is a time capsule of the Soviet 80s and also of the European 60s, and, for all its bleakness and disillusion, there is a poignant innocence in it. · Little Vera screens on 27 June at Regent Street Cinema, London. 58192018-06-21T08:07:28Zfalsefalse2018-06-21T21:44:54ZUKtheguardian.com https://gu.com/p/8zhlfalsetruehttps://media.guim.co.uk/1f62fc99e01ebe16db91bfe1d70343d83549a74d/5_299_1872_1123/500.jpgfalseen'I see a big beautiful Soviet feeling being born here ..."

      <title>Public: Good year: Bad year: The writing was on the wall: Regulators have come in the line of fire this year for not anticipating the financial crash, but it hasn't been a bad year for everyone</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In a year as cataclysmic as this, it's easy to forget crises don't come out of the blue. The writing was already on the wall when, this time last year, we noted it had been a bad year for Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, who was pilloried for his perceived failure in handling the Northern Rock collapse.</p>
      <p>This year's financial meltdown has produced yet more bad news for regulators, but the scale has changed. While the prime minister is credited with having carried out heroic acts to save the UK if not the global economy, regulators are under heavy fire for not having anticipated the or even prevented the crash.</p>
      <p>Audit and scrutiny functions in general have not had a good year. The row over public bodies' investments in failed Icelandic banks has been acrimonious and some audit bodies are sounding defensive. The Wales Audit Office, for instance, says its role is clear: to review how organisations follow guidance, not the spending decisions themselves (see page 11). In higher education, the Quality Assurance Agency was criticised by the vice chancellor of Buckingham University for "making the usual mistake of all failing regulatory bodies": burying itself in process and "box-ticking", rather than engaging in the monitoring of outcome or in thinking about policy.</p>
      <p>Questions were also raised about the state of children's services regulation after the death of Baby P (see p24).</p>
      <p>Departments</p>
      <p>The Home Office, described in 2006 by the then home secretary John Reid as not fit for purpose, is doing much better, having lost some of its former functions to the Ministry of Justice. But its handling of proposals to increase the maximum period a person can be detained without charge to 42 days was far less effective. The justice ministry, on the other hand, has not had a good year; in addition to leaked job and budget cuts, it was forced to scrap its plan to link prison and probation IT systems.</p>
      <p>The Department of Work and Pensions had a good year: its Jobcentre Plus rollout got a rare rave review from the Commons' public accounts committee, which said the success of the programme was due to "sound governance, intelligent use of existing guidance and external advice, and strong support from the leadership of the organisation". The MPs noted that a critical factor was "the consistent senior management team, who between them had over 100 years of frontline operational experience in the agency's business".</p>
      <p>Some worry that despite this praise, the department may find it difficult to sustain its welfare-to-work policies in the face of a recession and a big rise in unemployment.</p>
      <p>A mixed year for the Department of Health, whose flagship Connecting for Health IT programme is faltering and whose attempts to improve hospital cleanliness have largely failed. On a brighter note, the state of NHS finances has improved from last year, while health minister Lord Darzi's review was acclaimed.</p>
      <p>A similar story in education, where there was praise for the children plan, but widespread opprobrium for the serious delays in the marking of Sats tests.</p>
      <p>People</p>
      <p>Promotion for Lesley Strathie, who moved from chief executive of Jobcentre Plus to become permanent secretary at HMRC. Success too for another DWP senior executive: Terry Moran was made the chief executive of the new Pension, Disability and Carers Service.</p>
      <p>Moira Wallace, long-tipped for great things, has finally got the recognition many said was her due, becoming the permanent secretary of the newly created Department for Energy and Climate Change.</p>
      <p>This meant a less good year for both Helen Ghosh at environment and Sir Brian Bender at business, who both lost responsibilities in the creation of the new department.</p>
      <p>David Normington, who has been the permanent secretary at the Home Office since January 2006, has steered his department through a good year another Home Office leader, Lin Homer, the chief executive of the Borders and Immigration Agency has been through a tough time in a high-profile agency, but has weathered the storm so far and emerged with reputation increased rather than dented.</p>
      <p>Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary deserves credit for pushing through the Whitehall capability reviews. They were resisted, but are beginning to show results.</p>
      <p>Another good year for Sir John Elvidge, steering government in Scotland through political change and now producing a blueprint for streamlined, joined-up public service.</p>
      <p>Thinktanks</p>
      <p>Thinktank of the year was the Royal United Services Institute, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies runner up. It was noted, however, that none anticipated the financial crash and its consequences for fiscal policy, not even the IFS.</p>

      <p>1 ARANCINI EGGS</p>
      <p>(ON THE COVER)</p>
      <p>This is a twist on the Scotch egg, substituting risotto for the sausage meat to make a sort of vegetarian-friendly arancino-cum-Scotch egg. There are several steps, but none are particularly difficult and most of them can be done a day ahead.</p>
      <p>Makes 12</p>
      <p>12 quail eggs</p>
      <p>A knob of butter</p>
      <p>1 shallot, peeled and finely chopped</p>
      <p>1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped</p>
      <p>200g arborio risotto rice</p>
      <p>150ml dry white wine</p>
      <p>750ml vegetable or chicken stock</p>
      <p>50g parmesan, grated</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>2 tbsp flour, seasoned</p>
      <p>2 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
      <p>50g fine dried breadcrumbs</p>
      <p>1 litre vegetable oil</p>
      <p>1 Fill a bowl with cold water and ice. Bring a pan of water to a boil and carefully drop in 6 of the quail eggs. Boil for 2 minutes, then transfer to the iced water. Repeat with the remaining eggs and set aside.</p>
      <p>2 Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium-low heat and cook the shallot and garlic for about 10 minutes, until softened. Increase the heat and add the rice. Stir for a minute or two, then add the wine and simmer until almost entirely reduced. Add a ladle of hot stock and continue to simmer, stirring regularly and adding a ladle of stock whenever the rice looks dry. Cook for about 25 minutes, or until the rice is soft. Stir in the parmesan, season to taste and leave to cool.</p>
      <p>3 Carefully peel the quail eggs and roll in a little flour to help the rice cling to the eggs. Take a handful of rice and pat it flat in your palm. Lay an egg in the middle and shape the rice around the outside, gently rolling it between your palms to firm. Repeat with the remaining eggs and chill for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>4 Line up three bowls, the first containing the flour, the second the beaten eggs, and the third the breadcrumbs. One at a time, coat the risotto balls in flour - shaking off any excess - then in egg, and finally in the breadcrumbs. Cover and chill until ready to cook.</p>
      <p>5 Ten minutes before serving, in a large pan, heat the oil to about 170C/340F/gas mark 3-4, or until a cube of bread sizzles and turns golden in 30 seconds. Carefully drop in the risotto balls, 6 at a time, and fry for 4-5 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen roll and keep them warm while you cook the rest, then serve.</p>

      <p>2 BRUNCH HASH</p>
      <p>This is one of the yummiest brunch dishes out there, and so easy and quick to cook, too.</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>500g potatoes, diced</p>
      <p>3 tbsp light oil</p>
      <p>2 tbsp butter</p>
      <p>2 onions, diced into 2.5cm squares</p>
      <p>4 really thick slices of salt beef, weighing about 75g each, roughly broken into large pieces</p>
      <p>1-2 tbsp Dijon mustard, to taste</p>
      <p>A large handful of flat-leaf parsley, chopped</p>
      <p>4 medium cooked beetroot (about 200g), diced</p>
      <p>4 spring onions, sliced</p>
      <p>4 eggs</p>
      <p>A good pinch of chilli flakes</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>1 Cover the potatoes with cold salted water, put on a high heat and bring to the boil, then simmer until almost tender and drain.</p>
      <p>2 While the spuds are cooking, heat half the oil with half the butter in a large, heavy pan and fry the onions over a medium heat until they are softening and starting to brown. Chuck in the drained potatoes, add the rest of the oil, turn the heat up to maximum, and fry for a few more minutes, until the potatoes are just starting to pick up some colour.</p>
      <p>3 Season, stir in the beef, mustard and parsley and lastly add the beetroot, turning it in carefully so that you avoid turning everything pink. Once the beetroot is warm - just a minute or two - turn the heat off and stir in the spring onions.</p>
      <p>4 In a separate pan, fry the eggs in the rest of the butter, then season and sprinkle with chilli flakes. Divide the hash into 4 portions and put an egg on top of each.</p>

      <p>3 BURMESE DUCK EGG CURRY</p>
      <p>Egg curries aren't that common on menus in the UK, but they are very common across Asia. Serve with rice and pickled cabbage, if you like.</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>6 duck eggs</p>
      <p>125ml light oil, such as peanut or grapeseed</p>
      <p>2 banana shallots (or 4 regular), peeled and sliced into thin rings</p>
      <p>2 onions, peeled and chopped</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp turmeric</p>
      <p>2-3 bird's-eye chillies, finely sliced</p>
      <p>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</p>
      <p>1/2 a thumb of ginger, trimmed and finely chopped</p>
      <p>1 1/2 tbsp tomato puree</p>
      <p>1 tbsp curry powder</p>
      <p>250g okra, trimmed and cut into bite-size pieces</p>
      <p>3 medium tomatoes, roughly chopped</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp shrimp paste</p>
      <p>A handful of chopped coriander</p>
      <p>Salt</p>
      <p>1 Bring a pan of water to the boil and carefully lower in the duck eggs.</p>
      <p>2 Cook for 4-6 minutes, depending on size, then run under cold water, peel and set aside.</p>
      <p>3 Heat the oil in a wide saucepan. When it's hot, add the shallots, breaking them up into rings. Once they are a deep golden brown (5-8 minutes), use a slotted spoon to transfer them on to kitchen roll and sprinkle with salt.</p>
      <p>4 Put the duck eggs into the hot oil and lower the heat. Fry them for 3-4 minutes, turning them to brown on all sides, then take them out of the pan and sit them on kitchen roll.</p>
      <p>5 Keeping the pan on a medium heat, add the onions, turmeric, chillies, garlic and ginger and fry for a few minutes, until it all starts to soften, then stir in the tomato puree.</p>
      <p>6 Cook for a minute or two before adding the curry powder.</p>
      <p>7 Add the okra with a big pinch of salt, then the tomatoes, and give it all a good stir.</p>
      <p>8 Dissolve the shrimp paste in 500ml of hot water, pour it into the pan and bring to a fast simmer. Let it bubble away busily for about 10 minutes without a lid to reduce, then lower the eggs back into the pan giving them a prod so they are mostly submerged in the liquid. Put the lid on and simmer for another couple of minutes so the eggs warm through, then turn the heat off and let it rest for 3 minutes.</p>
      <p>9 Finish by sprinkling a little salt on each egg and scattering on the shallots, with roughly chopped coriander to top off each serving.</p>

      <p>4 SOUFFLED EGG AND BACON TART</p>
      <p>This tart is like a cross between a traditional quiche lorraine, a souffle, and a British egg and bacon pie. It's best served warm, straight from the oven, while it is still light and fluffy.</p>
      <p>Serves 6-8</p>
      <p>For the pastry</p>
      <p>225g plain flour</p>
      <p>65g chilled butter, cut into small pieces</p>
      <p>65g chilled lard, cut into small pieces</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
      <p>For the filling</p>
      <p>1 tsp sunflower oil</p>
      <p>200g thick-cut smoked streaky bacon,</p>
      <p>cut into short fat strips</p>
      <p>50g butter</p>
      <p>25g plain flour</p>
      <p>175ml whole milk, warmed</p>
      <p>100g hard cheese such as cheddar or Lincolnshire poacher, finely grated</p>
      <p>150ml double cream</p>
      <p>1/4 tsp nutmeg, freshly grated</p>
      <p>3 medium eggs, separated</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>1 For the pastry, put the flour into a food processor with the butter, lard and 1/2 tsp of salt and briefly whizz until the mix looks like fine breadcrumbs.</p>
      <p>2 Tip into a mixing bowl and stir in about 2 tbsp of water until everything comes together in a ball, then turn out on to a lightly floured surface and knead briefly until smooth.</p>
      <p>3 Thinly roll out the pastry and use to line a lightly greased 23 x 4cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Prick the base with a fork and chill for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200C/450F/gas mark 6.</p>
      <p>4 Line the pastry case with greaseproof paper and fill with a thin layer of baking beans. Blind bake for 15-20 minutes until the edges of the pastry are biscuit-coloured. Remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for 5-6 minutes until the base is crisp and golden.</p>
      <p>5 While the pastry case is cooking, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a high heat. Add the bacon and fry briskly until lightly golden. Set aside.</p>
      <p>6 Melt the butter in a medium-size pan, add the flour and cook for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and gradually stir in the warm milk. Return to the heat and bring to the boil, stirring continuously, until smooth. Add the grated cheese and cream and stir together, then add the nutmeg, bacon and some salt and pepper to taste and leave to cool slightly.</p>
      <p>7 Remove the tart case from the oven and lower the temperature to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Stir the egg yolks into the sauce. Put the whites in a large, clean mixing bowl and whisk them into soft peaks, then fold into the sauce.</p>
      <p>8 Pour the mix into the case and bake for 30 minutes, covering with a sheet of foil after about 20 minutes, until puffed up, set and golden brown. Serve immediately.</p>

      <p>5 EGG AND AUBERGINE</p>
      <p>SABICH SANDWICH</p>
      <p>If you have pickles or gherkins - preferably ones with some spice - substitute them for the cucumber to make this more authentic. Slices of tomato would be welcome too.</p>
      <p>Serves 2</p>
      <p>1 small aubergine</p>
      <p>Salt</p>
      <p>Olive oil</p>
      <p>2 eggs</p>
      <p>3 tbsp tahini</p>
      <p>2 tbsp lemon juice</p>
      <p>2 tbsp water</p>
      <p>2 tsp olive oil</p>
      <p>1 tsp coriander, finely chopped</p>
      <p>1 tsp parsley, finely chopped</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp jalepeno, deseeded and chopped (optional)</p>
      <p>1 small cucumber,</p>
      <p>peeled and sliced thinly lengthways</p>
      <p>4 slices of good bread or 2 pittas</p>
      <p>1 Preheat the oven to 200C/450F/gas mark 6. Slice the aubergine and lay the slices on a baking tray lined with kitchen roll. Salt them well, then flip and salt again. Let them rest for about 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>2 Press down on the slices with kitchen roll to remove moisture. Toss in a bowl with 2 tbsp oil, then arrange in one layer on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the edges are dark brown. Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature. You can make these up to 2 days in advance.</p>
      <p>3 Bring a pan of water to the boil and boil the eggs for 7 minutes, then allow to cool.</p>
      <p>4 Whisk together the tahini, lemon juice, water, olive oil, herbs and jalepeno, until creamy. Add a pinch of salt and taste.</p>
      <p>5 For each sandwich, spread all the slices of bread (or the pitta) with the tahini sauce. Peel and slice the hardboiled egg and layer it on top. Sprinkle with salt. Layer about 4 slices of roasted aubergine, then cover with the cucumber. Top the sandwich with a second tahini-lined slice of bread.</p>

      <p>6 NICOISE SALAD</p>
      <p>WITH TUNA SAUCE</p>
      <p>A tasty alternative to the traditional recipe.</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>300g green beans, topped and tailed</p>
      <p>12 medium charlotte potatoes</p>
      <p>4 eggs</p>
      <p>80g shallots, finely chopped</p>
      <p>40g pitted black olives, halved</p>
      <p>40g pitted green olives, halved</p>
      <p>1 tbsp baby capers</p>
      <p>20 anchovy fillets</p>
      <p>For the oven-dried tomatoes</p>
      <p>4 plum vine tomatoes, quartered</p>
      <p>250g cherry vine tomatoes, halved</p>
      <p>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</p>
      <p>1 tsp fresh thyme, chopped</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped</p>
      <p>1 1/2 tbsp icing sugar</p>
      <p>150ml olive oil</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>For the tuna sauce</p>
      <p>3 egg yolks</p>
      <p>1 tsp English mustard</p>
      <p>4 anchovy fillets</p>
      <p>Juice and zest of 1 lemon</p>
      <p>2 garlic cloves</p>
      <p>Salt and black pepper</p>
      <p>400ml vegetable oil</p>
      <p>150g canned tuna</p>
      <p>50ml single cream</p>
      <p>Worcestershire sauce</p>
      <p>Tabasco sauce</p>
      <p>1 First of all make the oven-dried tomatoes. Heat the oven to 110C/230F/gas mark 1/4 , then put all the tomatoes in a roasting tin lined with baking parchment. Mix the rest of the tomato ingredients and sprinkle over the top, then roast for 90 minutes. You'll have more tomatoes than you need, but they keep very well.</p>
      <p>2 Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to the boil, add the beans and cook for 3 minutes, then plunge them into iced water to cool.</p>
      <p>3 Now boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, then drain and leave to cool. Cut them in half lengthways, then in half again.</p>
      <p>4 While the potatoes are cooking, hard boil the eggs for 9 minutes, then cool under running water. Peel carefully, then cut in half.</p>
      <p>5 To make the tuna sauce, whizz the egg yolks with the mustard, anchovies, lemon juice and zest, garlic, salt and pepper in a blender. Slowly add the oil - add a little water if it's too thick. Add the tuna, cream and Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces, then blend until smooth. Check the seasoning.</p>
      <p>6 To serve, mix the tomatoes with the shallots, olives, capers and anchovies and stir well. In another bowl, mix the green beans with the potatoes, then stir in enough tuna sauce to bind them together then add the tomatoes and place the halved eggs on top. Serve with the rest of the tuna sauce.</p>

      <p>7 COFFEE CARAMEL CUSTARDS</p>
      <p>Or as the French call it, creme caramel au cafe. The added coffee flavour in this recipe is both subtle and sophisticated.</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>400ml whole milk</p>
      <p>4 espresso coffees</p>
      <p>A small carton of double cream</p>
      <p>80g espresso coffee beans</p>
      <p>A pinch of salt</p>
      <p>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</p>
      <p>120g caster sugar</p>
      <p>3-4 tbsp water</p>
      <p>3 eggs</p>
      <p>4 egg yolks</p>
      <p>75g caster sugar</p>
      <p>1 Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Pour the milk into a measuring jug and add the four espresso coffees. Now top up this mixture with double cream until it reaches 600ml. Pour into a pan and add the coffee beans, salt and the vanilla extract. Warm together, occasionally stirring, until just below simmering point. Switch off the heat, cover with a lid and leave to infuse for at least 2 hours.</p>
      <p>2 Now put the sugar in a heavy-based saucepan and add the water. Bring to a simmer and cook slowly until the sugar has become a richly coloured caramel; take care during the final stages, so as not to burn it. Pour into the base of 4 dariole moulds or small ramekins, dividing the caramel between them. Leave to cool.</p>
      <p>3 Put the eggs, yolks and caster sugar into a large bowl. Whisk together lightly then strain over the coffee-infused milk (discarding the beans). Gently whisk together until well blended, then ladle the mixture into the caramel-lined moulds and fill to the brim.</p>
      <p>4 Place them in a deep roasting tin and fill with hot water, so that it rises up the outside of the moulds by about three quarters. Carefully slide the tin into the oven and loosely lay a sheet of tin foil over the surface of the moulds. Bake in the oven until the custards are set, about 40-45 minutes. To check when they are ready, lightly press a finger on the surface, or give them a little shake: they should wobble.</p>
      <p>5 Remove from the oven, take out of the roasting tin and leave to cool. When quite cold, cover each custard with a small sheet of clingfilm and put in the fridge for at least three hours. To unmould, run a small knife around the edge of the custard and up-end on to individual, shallow dishes.</p>

      <p>8 OVERNIGHT FRENCH TOAST</p>
      <p>This French toast is really elegant, and simple enough that a drizzle of maple syrup and</p>
      <p>a little icing sugar complements it perfectly.</p>
      <p>Serves 8-10</p>
      <p>170g light brown sugar</p>
      <p>4 tbsp butter, melted</p>
      <p>1 loaf of brioche or challah, sliced into 3cm-thick slices</p>
      <p>240ml milk</p>
      <p>8 eggs, lightly beaten</p>
      <p>1 tbsp vanilla extract</p>
      <p>A pinch of salt</p>
      <p>1 tsp cinnamon</p>
      <p>1/4 tsp ground ginger</p>
      <p>50g pecans, chopped</p>
      <p>Maple syrup and icing sugar, to finish (optional)</p>
      <p>1 In a small bowl combine the brown sugar and melted butter and pour on to the bottom of a large ovenproof dish.</p>
      <p>2 Arrange the slices of bread in the dish, overlapping if necessary.</p>
      <p>3 Combine the milk, eggs, vanilla, salt, cinnamon and ginger in a bowl and pour evenly over the bread slices. Sprinkle the pecans on top then wrap in clingfilm and chill for 4-12 hours.</p>
      <p>4 In the morning, take the dish out of the fridge and preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 5.</p>
      <p>5 Bake for 30-35 minutes. If the top starts browning too quickly, cover loosely with foil for the last 10 minutes or so. You want it to cook long enough to make sure the bottom part is cooked, but don't dry it out completely.</p>
      <p>6 Remove from oven and let it cool slightly before serving. Dust with icing sugar and a drizzle with maple syrup.</p>

      <p>9 TEXAN MIGAS</p>
      <p>This dish is designed to use up old stale tortillas, though if you only have fresh ones the end result will not suffer.</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>8 eggs</p>
      <p>120ml milk</p>
      <p>80ml peanut oil</p>

      <p>10 PORTUGUESE CUSTARD TARTS</p>
      <p>Portugal has as many different pasteis de nata as it has bakers, each convinced of holding the secret recipe of this crispy soft-centre custard pie. Here's our version . . .</p>
      <p>Makes 12-15</p>
      <p>For the pastry</p>
      <p>1/4 tsp salt</p>
      <p>80ml water</p>
      <p>80g bread flour</p>
      <p>80g plain flour</p>
      <p>135g butter (75g softened, the rest cold)</p>
      <p>For the custard</p>
      <p>125g caster sugar</p>
      <p>70ml hot water from the kettle</p>
      <p>40g plain four</p>
      <p>275ml milk</p>
      <p>6 egg yolks</p>
      <p>1/4 lemon, zest grated</p>
      <p>A large pinch of cinnamon, plus extra for dusting</p>
      <p>1 To make the pastry, dissolve the salt in the water. Mix the flours, 15g of the softened butter and water into a dough. Knead for 2 minutes. Form into a ball, cut a cross on the top with scissors, wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>2 Heat the sugar and hot water in a saucepan. Simmer for 3 minutes. Leave to cool slightly. Whisk the flour and 150ml of the milk in a saucepan until smooth. Whisk in the rest of the milk, egg yolks, lemon zest, cinnamon and finally the sugar syrup. Place over a low heat and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, stirring regularly until the custard thickens. Give it a good stir, pour into a measuring jug, cover the surface with clingfilm to prevent a skin forming, and leave to cool.</p>
      <p>3 Roll the pastry into a 17cm square. Flatten the cold butter and place on top, then wrap the dough over the butter and roll into a 30 x 15cm rectangle. Fold the bottom third over the centre, cover with the top third and give it a quarter turn. Roll a second time and fold again. Sprinkle with flour if some of the butter comes out. Chill for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>4 Roll out into a 30 x 15cm rectangle, fold as before, give it a quarter turn and roll again into a 35 x 15cm rectangle. Spread the rest of the soft butter evenly over the top and roll starting from the shorter edge to obtain a 15cm plump roll. Spread any butter left on your hands on the outside of the roll, wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>5 Preheat the oven and oven tray to 250C/500F/gas mark 10.</p>
      <p>6 Holding the roll with both hands, gently squeeze and pull into a thinner 30cm long roll then cut into 12-15 1.5cm pieces. Spread each piece, rolled side upwards, evenly over the bottom and half way up the sides of a buttered muffin tin to form thin tartlet bases.</p>
      <p>7 Fill each tartlet with the custard mix, place on the preheated oven tray and bake for 15 to 18 minutes. Cool for at least 30 minutes and serve with a dusting of cinnamon if you like.</p>

      <title>G2: Style: Q&amp;A: Ask Hadley: When in the land of elves, do as the elves do - as with all themed weddings ...</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>My friends are having a themed wedding next month - "1950s Rockabilly". Do I really have to follow the dress code or can I go in my normal wedding guest outfit (a suit)?</p>
      <p>David, by email</p>
      <p>Ah yes, the themed wedding. The only thing that can reveal heretofore unknown aspects of a friend's personality other than what kind of wedding they opt for is what names they choose for their kids. Even the sturdiest of friendships can wobble in the face of a birth announcement saying how happy everyone is about the arrival of Strawberry Cricket Moonshine. It's very hard not to see your friend differently once they're the parent of little Zorro Boxer and Ibiza Merryweather, and it's downright impossible not to rewrite your entire shared past once the wedding invite arrives demanding that you partake in their special day theme: The Little Mermaid.</p>
      <p>I've been thinking a lot about themed weddings of late, not because I have to go to any (thank God, I pretty much choose my friends on the likelihood of their ever having a themed wedding), but because one in particular has been in the news - that of a young man by the name of Sean Parker, aka, the guy Justin Timberlake played in The Social Network.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Parker decided to celebrate his love for his longterm girlfriend by holding a Lord of the Rings-esque wedding, which cost him about $9m (£5.9m). Just to clarify, Parker is not 16 - he is a 34-year-old man. To Parker's astonishment, his wedding was roundly mocked in the media, in some cases unfairly (it was claimed his wedding damaged the environment - he says it didn't), in some cases fairly (to reiterate, he held a $9m fantasy novel wedding.)</p>
      <p>Parker was so outraged about the vilification of his wedding that he took to - what else? - the internet to decry the "link-baiting" depths to which journalism has sunk, without really bothering to consider the part, as the founding president of Facebook, he has played in creating this link-baiting land.</p>
      <p>Putting on a wedding is, I imagine, exhausting in itself, but putting on a themed wedding makes invading a small country look like a teabreak. Parker writes about how he spent two years looking for the perfect patch of woodland for his fantasy novel wedding. Can you imagine tramping through forests for two years? I don't think I've ever had a relationship last two years, let alone spent that long looking for something. It should also be noted that Parker spent what looks like another two years writing his tear-soaked invective against his critics, seeing as it is almost 10,000 words long. All in all, Parker comes out of this looking like a man who has a little bit too much time on his hands, which might explain his love of 900-page novels about elves. Maybe being a Silicon Valley millionaire is a lot easier than most of us have been led to believe.</p>
      <p>But it is a free world and if someone wants to spend $9m on pretending he and his new wife are elves in the forest, then they are certainly allowed to do so. If he doesn't care about how much his friends will wince at the invites, more power to him, let him have his Special Day. As long as he provides his guests with food, drink and places to stay, then go forth and be elvish, Sean Parker. (Incidentally, I have been hearing of a new wedding trend in which guests are urged "to camp" as opposed to stay in a hotel. One can only assume that these couples don't actually want any of their friends to come to the wedding.)</p>
      <p>Now, if this column has any kind of message it is, simply, dress any way you feel comfortable and bugger the rules. So going by that basic tenet, my advice should be to forget the themed wedding strictures, and wear your suit.</p>
      <p>But here's the thing, David. A wedding is one of those occasions when you're only there for the sake of the happy couple - and so it is my belief that wedding guests should follow whatever instructions the bride and groom issue. These people are paying for your food and drink, so just play an extra in the movie of their Special Day and get on with it. If you feel you cannot abide by their wardrobe instructions, then don't go. So David, either start practising your rockabilly quiff and go to the wedding, or stay at home in your suit. Trying to have it both ways is just rude.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you do go, you need to commit to the festivities - there are few things worse than a party guest who snootily stands on the sidelines and refuses to join in. Obviously Parker's defence of his wedding is eminently laughable. But, by God, the man commits and is commendably, defiantly, unashamed of his wedding and it's an attitude that all themed wedding guests are advised to follow. Being Banquo at the feast is bad enough. Being the three-piece suit in the land of elves is, it seems to me, far more shaming.</p>

      <title>Saturday Review: Geoff Dyer: A LIFE IN WRITING: I don't suppose there are many John Berger nuts who are also interested in the first world war, jazz and photography</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Part bad pun, part nod to Thomas Mann, from a writer who is known both as a stylist and for bleeding away the boundaries between the real and the imagined, the title of Geoff Dyer's latest novel, Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi, has to be making some kind of statement. But what?</p>
      <p>Dyer appears puzzled by the suggestion, preferring a simple narrative explanation instead. He and his wife had been to the Venice Biennale in 2003, had been overwhelmed by the heat and intensity of the occasion, and he had wanted to write a fictional account of it. He quotes George Steiner's observation that, implicit in loving any book is the desire to write a response, though he qualifies this by acknowledging it was more the idea of Mann's Death in Venice as a universal template than the book itself to which he was responding.</p>
      <p>"I think I've clearly highlighted it isn't me by calling him Jeff with a J," he says. But he didn't call him John, Jack or Jim, names that would have done away with any confusion from the start. And he does have form. Early on in his 2003 memoir-cum-travelogue, Yoga For People Who Can't be Bothered to Do It , which won the WH Smith travel book award, there is a reference to a Jeff, who is unmistakeably our Geoff.</p>
      <p>"Really!" he says, laughing, completely unfazed and unrepentant at being caught out. "I'd forgotten that. So, I was playing with this kind of stuff back then. I must own up to having a fondness for my name! The blurring of fact and fiction is part of the fun, so of course there are parts of me in there.</p>
      <p>"I could never write a book where the point-of-view character was a short person, because I just can't imagine what that's like. I do understand my limitations as a fiction writer, which is why my novels are always going to be close to home. But equally, there are lots of things about Jeff that aren't like me at all. The key to his pissed-offness is that he hasn't written any books; my life at least has the illusion of purpose."</p>
      <p>But Jeff is still a writer . . . You can go round in circles with this stuff. No sooner do you think you've got hold of Geoff than you find you're hanging on to Jeff. It's rather like talking to Dyer in person. From time to time he can blah on a bit, and just when you're thinking he takes himself a bit too seriously, he'll smile, make a few gags at his own expense and say, "Fuck me, that was a load of pretentious crap".</p>
      <p>In a writing career - not a word Dyer likes to use - of more than 20 years, he has turned out four novels, including Jeff in Venice , a broad range of non-fiction on subjects as diverse as literary criticism, the first world war and photography that have been garlanded with literary prizes in the UK and the US, and he's also been rewarded with publishing's equivalent of a long-service medal - a collection of his reviews and essays.</p>
      <p>His dustjackets are splattered with the sort of quotes from fellow authors you'd be quite happy to have on your gravestone. William Boyd calls him "a true original - one of those rare voices in contemporary literature that never ceases to surprise, disturb and delight"; Zadie Smith likens him to "a postmodern Kingsley Amis: a national treasure"; for David Lodge he is "pure pleasure" and so on.</p>
      <p>Which presents a slight problem. Dyer is not an ingenu; he is now 50. Yet he is still something of a literary outlier."Oh dear," he laughs, "I guess it's my unfailing eye for missing the boat and career self-destruction.</p>
      <p>"When I started writing, the deal was that publishers gave you a grand or two as an advance to buy some sweets, with the promise that they would make a big putsch with your fourth book when you'd built up a bit of a following. But by the time my fourth book came out, previously unpublished authors were the new big thing."</p>
      <p>The structure of the new novel is disconcerting. The first "Jeff in Venice" half is familiar Dyer territory: third-person male narrator, Jeff - much the same age and height as Dyer - goes to Venice for the Biennale, gets a bit wasted on drugs and booze and has an intense affair with an impossibly attractive, much younger American woman, Laura.</p>
      <p>So for the "Death in Varanasi" sequence you're rather expecting some kind of resolution to Jeff and Laura's relationship. Instead, you get a first-person narrative from someone who may or may not be Jeff - it's never made explicit, though you rather assume he is - who accepts a travel writing gig to Varanasi and never comes back. And by the time you finally twig that Laura isn't going to reappear, that she's been left in mid-air, mid-book, it's hard not to feel a little cheated.</p>
      <p>"With my usual unerring eye for commercial suicide," he says, "I originally wanted to subtitle the book 'A Diptych' to make clear the two stories were separate. But I was urged not to, and when I saw a mock-up of the front cover with the word 'diptych' on it, I thought, 'Oh God, that's too pretentious even for me'. So I agreed to knock it off. But I'm beginning now to wonder if I shouldn't have let it stand.</p>
      <p>"When I sent a first draft to a friend in Canada," he says, "he advised me to make the connections between the two halves much more explicit. And my immediate response was, 'yes you're right', and I started rewriting it in that way. But then I thought, 'hold on, you've never been a big story-teller or plot maker, so why play to my weakness?' Rather than trying to solve the problem, I decided to do away with it and make the two halves distinct. So it's not clear whether the second half even chronologically follows the first or if it's the same person; just as everyone is an avatar of someone else in Hindu myth, so the characters are different incarnations of each other."</p>
      <p>If you really want to get to grips with his authorial identity, Dyer himself suggests, you are better off thinking of each book as a small part of a larger whole that comprises the unity of the Dyer experience than as separate entities in themselves.</p>
      <p>"If you just take me as a fiction writer, then you're probably going to find me fairly limited. I don't come up with great story lines and my three previous novels ( The Colour of Memory (1989), The Search (1993) and Paris Trance (1998)) could all loosely be said to be about the same thing - a group of friends having a good time together."</p>
      <p>Dyer calls The Colour of Memory "a bit of a mess, though with lyrical passages of which I remain quite fond", while The Search gets a brutal "it sank without trace".</p>
      <p>While his fiction may feel a bit samey and lightweight, his non-fiction is anything but. As ever with Dyer, you have to issue a warning about possible category errors. Non-fiction for him is really just another location on the fiction continuum, and versions of Geoff/Jeff are as likely to turn up there as anywhere else; but, given this, the range of subject matter is prolifically diverse. And, unlike his fiction, there is no sense - apart from a lightness of touch and flashes of comedy - that you are getting a standard Dyer take on a subject. In Ways of Telling , Dyer took on John Berger, a literary hero whom he has gone on to outdo in the range of his output; The Missing of the Somme is a mini-masterpiece on memory and loss inspired by a chance visit to the first world war Thiepval Memorial; But Beautiful is a lyrical, offbeat homage to the jazz greats; Out of Sheer Rage manages to pull off the impossible - an engaging book on Dyer's failure to write a serious critique of DH Lawrence; Yoga for People Who Can't be Bothered to Do It is part-travelogue, part-memoir, part-history, and should by rights be a total mess but somehow hangs together; and in The Ongoing Moment he came up with a series of scholarly essays on photography that had professional snappers drooling in admiration despite Dyer's flip but frank admission that "he can't be bothered to take pictures himself when he goes abroad because it's too much effort".</p>
      <p>As he admits, he's rather gone out of his way not to build a following. "I don't suppose there are many Berger nuts who are also interested in the first world war, jazz and photography. But I've always taken the view that I'll write what I want to write. Whenever a publisher asks me what I'm going to do next I say, 'Whatever the fuck I want.' After all, it's me that's going to be stuck indoors doing the hard work, so I might as well try and enjoy it."</p>
      <p>So if someone suggested he do a book on tennis - Dyer plays as often as his increasingly wonky knees allow, and the hallway to his flat is stuffed with trainers and cans of balls - where he takes on Federer, Nadal and Murray, he'd turn it down on principle? "Er, as a matter of fact, I have proposed something like that already," he confesses.</p>
      <p>This might offer his publisher and agent a chink of hope, but you can't help feeling that Dyer's determined anti-careerism will be making them a little anxious. After roughly 15 years of being published by Little, Brown, Jeff in Venice is his first outing for Canongate, and the idea behind the move must be to try to take him over the line from cult to mainstream. "Writers switch publishers the whole time. The reason I went to Canongate was that my American agent, who also represents Jeffrey Eugenides, told (Canongate publisher) Jamie Byng that 'Geoff' was thinking of moving publishers. Jamie thought he was in with a chance of getting Eugenides, and by the time he realised it was me it was too late to back out."</p>
      <p>It's that old Geoff/Jeff thing again.</p>
      <p>There's also the matter of what Dyer quite happily calls his "arrested development". Search through his books and you'll find barely a mention of children. "I've never had any desire either to have children or to write about them," he says. "The things that interest me now are pretty much the same things that interested me when I was in my early 20s." This could have restricted his development as a writer, but Dyer has made it work for him. On a practical level, he hasn't needed to sell out for a bigger advance as, without anyone else to worry about, he's been quite happy single-mindedly bumping along in the pursuit of the writer's life; and on an artistic level, he's had little interference to distract him.</p>
      <p>O ut of Sheer Rage , Dyer's non-book about DH Lawrence, is a case in point. It works so well precisely because he left it far too long to write the book that he originally wanted to write - a serious critique - that he ended up with an extremely funny and arguably even more serious book about the deadening effects on literature of the kind of leaden critical theory he had been planning to write. It's a book that only Dyer could have written; not just for its panache but because you can't imagine anyone else getting round to it. For him, it was a book he simply had to get out of his system. "Lawrence had always been a huge influence on me since university," he says. Apart from their explicit depictions of sex, it's hard to see too many parallels between the two; where Lawrence tends to the florid, intense and overwrought, Dyer is pared down, relaxed and comic. So what was the attraction? "Class."</p>
      <p>Dyer comes across as the quintessential, slightly bohemian, north-London literary man. He talks softly, with a vaguely classless, metropolitan accent, and his Camden flat has all the accessories - wood floors and joss sticks - you'd associate with the alternative middle-class. "Yes," he smiles. "There's something about coming from Cheltenham that makes everyone snigger and think of a refined gentility.</p>
      <p>"But my father was a sheet-metal worker and my mother was a school dinner lady and hospital cleaner. Don't get me wrong, I'm not claiming to be from the wrong side of the tracks; we were a perfectly respectable, hard-working family. But we were poor: I was just one of those working-class boys who did well out of the grammar school system and went to Oxford.</p>
      <p>"Oxford was the perfect grounding for becoming a writer," he says, tongue in cheek. "With no lectures and just one tutorial per week, I got used to the idea of only doing what I wanted when I wanted. So living in Brixton, signing on the dole and trying to get by doing reviews for City Limits felt like a natural segue; I'm not sure how happy my parents were about it, mind."</p>
      <p>His reinvention has certainly paid off. He spent most of the 1990s abroad - France, the US and all destinations between - in pursuit of misery and muses, but this century he's been an almost ever-present figure on the London literary scene. His address book drips with writerly celebs, he's not shy of the odd party - "It's a lot more fun than staying at home or going to the pub, and the conversation's a lot better" - and his reviewing has lost some of its sharpness now he's one of the great and the good. "You can only review a friend's book if you really like it," he says a little awkwardly. "If you write and say you hate it, you can't really remain friends with them."</p>
      <p>You'd think, then, that Dyer was now pretty much where he'd always wanted to be. "Not really," he says. "I'd really like to be living in California. Ever since I first went there in my 20s I've felt I was born to be a West Coast writer. I just love it there and have fantasies about hanging out with Dave Eggers. I feel I'd notice things there, that I just don't here. In London, I'm just one of the crowd, staring at the ground, moaning and groaning."</p>
      <p>What's keeping him here, then? "My wife, Rebecca," he says gloomily. "She's got a good job here and really doesn't fancy moving to America." But what about the For Sale sign outside the flat? "It's only an incremental move to Islington or Clerkenwell. You should never underestimate the power of inertia."</p>
      <p>Not that you would count on inertia winning out indefinitely. A self-confident, single-minded only child with precious little baggage, Dyer is used to living by his own rules - both as a writer and in his everyday life - and to getting what he wants. He hasn't made too many compromises so far, and you can't see him making too many in the future. And even the ones he has made, he regrets.</p>
      <p>"An editor said that one of the sex scenes in Paris Trance made him feel a bit queasy and would I take it out?" he says. "I reluctantly agreed, but I should have been a little bolder, a little more fearless."</p>
      <p>When I get back to the office there's an email from Dyer. "I'd rather you didn't go into details of the sex scene I cut. My parents will probably read this, and I don't want to upset them." Whatever happened to bold and fearless?</p>

      <title>Story of cities #4: Beijing and the earliest planning document in history</title>
      <subtitle>The seemingly incoherent sprawl of modern Beijing is based on meticulous plans to bind citizens together under imperial rule. Conceived as a means of enforcing social order, the impact of planning remains strong in the city todayRead other articles in our story of cities series</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In the depths of Beijing's Planning Exhibition Hall, a big grey hangar that squats in the corner of Tiananmen Square, stands a scale model of the city. It is an endless field of tiny wooden and perspex blocks, low-rise courtyards huddled cheek by jowl with a motley jumble of towers, expanding ever outwards in concentric rings.</p>
      <p>To attempt to build a model of China's 22-million strong capital is a Sisyphean endeavour. This carpet of miniature rooftops is hopelessly incapable of keeping up with the city's relentless pace of change, the exhibition hall too small to ever contain a megalopolis so sprawling that it is currently building its seventh ring road, an orbital loop that will run for almost 1,000km in circumference.</p>
      <p>But the model's bird's-eye view exposes something that is illegible from the ground: the rigid order that underlies the rambling sprawl. A rhythm of axes, grids and symmetrical walled compounds emerges from the chaos, pointing to the fact that this seemingly incoherent metropolis is in fact the carefully structured product of one of the earliest planning documents in history.</p>
      <p>The first thing you notice is the monumental fissure that slices north-south through the city, as if the urban grain had been severed by a great tectonic rupture. It is an axis that runs for more than 20km, shooting out like a laser beam meridian line from the walls of the Forbidden City, the palatial compound that lies at the centre of it all.</p>
      <p>The 180-acre imperial palace appears to send ripples through the surrounding urban grain like a rock thrown into a pond, forming the successive layers of ring-roads. Its rhythm of symmetrical walled courtyards seems to structure the layout of the entire city, from the scale of blocks, to streets, to individual homes.</p>
      <p>The effect is no accident: Beijing was conceived as a diagram of an organised, harmonious society, designed to bind the citizens together in bricks and mortar under the supreme rule of the emperor. It was to be an expression of absolute power like no other city in the world.</p>
      <p>Founded more than 3,000 years ago as the city of Ji, Beijing's present urban form was established in the early Ming dynasty (1368-1644), when the Yongle emperor moved the imperial capital here from Nanjing.</p>
      <p>In establishing the fundamental layout of the new capital, the Ming reached for a suitably weighty touchstone, drawing on the teachings of the Kaogong Ji (roughly translated as "regulations of construction"), a text dating from the fifth century BC; part of the Rites of Zhou, an ancient Confucian manual of bureaucracy and organisational theory.</p>
      <p>"It was a means of legitimising their rule," says Toby Lincoln, lecturer in Chinese Urban History at the University of Leicester. "By explicitly drawing on this ancient manual of rites, their new capital city used divine numerology and ritual to express the power of the ruling elite in physical space."</p>
      <p>As one of the oldest examples of urban planning guidance in the world, the Kaogong Ji covers everything from how to determine north-south orientation when planning a new city (stick a pole in the ground and watch its shadow), to dictating the specific dimensions for local, regional and national capitals.</p>
      <p>It states that the national capital should be "a square with sides of nine li" (a traditional Chinese unit of measurement equivalent to around 500 metres), with "each side having three gateways". Inscribed within this square, it stipulates that there must be "nine avenues running north-south and nine running east-west, each of the former being nine chariot tracks wide" - a principle that perhaps set the precedent for the scale of modern-day Beijing's agoraphobia-inducing highways.</p>
      <p>But the ancient Han Chinese were less concerned with the practicalities of easing chariot traffic flow than with casting the capital as an expression of divine power, organising the city as a direct representation of the cosmos - with the emperor (aka the Son of Heaven) at the very centre of this model universe. Accordingly, the ideal city would take the form of a perfect square (the shape that the earth was deemed to be), with its principal roads dividing it into nine equal sectors, representing the nine provinces of the empire. The three gates on each of the city walls, meanwhile, stood for the three elements of the universe - heaven, earth and man - the total adding up to the 12 months of the year. Residing at the heart of this city-sized cosmogram, the emperor was the very middle of the Middle Kingdom itself: he who held power over the city and state, by extension, held control over all creation.</p>
      <p>So vast, so rich and so beautiful, that no man on earth could design anything superior to it</p>
      <p>Marco Polo</p>
      <p>And what a creation it was. When Marco Polo visited the city in the 13th century, before the Ming had taken control and begun their improvements, he described it as already being "so vast, so rich and so beautiful, that no man on earth could design anything superior to it". By the time the Yongle emperor had finished building his 10-metre thick walls in the mid-15th century, Beijing was the largest city in the world (a distinction it held until the early 19th century) - a majestic capital of the oldest and richest civilisation on the planet, whose command of science and technology far exceeded that of Europe, which was just emerging from the dark ages.</p>
      <p>This conception of the city as an expression of both regal power and social order, guided by cosmological principles and the pursuit of yin-yang equilibrium, was unlike anything in the western tradition. As architect and Chinese scholar Alfred Schinz, author of The Magic Square: Cities in Ancient China, puts it: it is "probably the most elaborate and complex system of thought developed by 'archaic' man about the world order and its reflection in a planned settlement structure".</p>
      <p>It was a form of symbolic planning that had a strong impact on the everyday life of the city, too, influencing the profane world beyond the realm of the emperor's divine rituals. Each of the city gates was assigned a particular function, according to the kind of traffic that was permitted to enter through it. Chaoyangmen, to the east, was used for grain, prompting warehouses to grow up around it. Andingmen, to the north, saw the daily flow of night-soil, with three great pans outside where it was dried and sold to farmers, stimulating agricultural trade immediately outside the city walls. Qianmen, to the south, was positioned on a central trading route, which fostered a lively market culture that continues to this day - although the informal street markets were sadly swept away and replaced with a Disneyfied traditional shopping street for the 2008 Olympics.</p>
      <p>The city plan also proved to be a powerful way of structuring and maintaining a sense of order down to the scale of the individual family, the walled compound form extending beyond the gates of the imperial palace and into the home. According to David Bray, author of Social Space and Governance in Urban China, not only did the walled city "embody a complex array of cosmologically determined symbolic spaces, designed to reinforce the might of the emperor and his government, but also, in its simple grid design it provided the template for the ordering of everyday social life."</p>
      <p>Just as the 180-acre imperial palace was structured as a rigid diagram of court hierarchy - its courtyards, halls and suites of 9,000 rooms organised according to the royal food chain - so too were Beijing's surrounding houses planned as an expression of the Confucian family structure. The traditional courtyard homes, or siheyuan, that line the city's hutong alleyways were arranged according to the "duties of obligation" between family members.</p>
      <p>The northern-most wing was the place of the patriarch and his wife (or wives), the eastern wing was for to the second-ranking male and his family, the western wing was for the third-ranking male, while the southern wing closest to the street was for servants and the menial functions of cooking and storage. As anthropologist Francesca Bray puts it, the traditional courtyard house was "a kind of loom, weaving individual lives into a typically Chinese social pattern" - the city itself a regularised tapestry of obedient subjects laid out before the emperor.</p>
      <p>The repetition of the walled compound as a means of enforcing social order was a tool that didn't go unnoticed centuries later by Chairman Mao. In his drive to erode the nuclear family structure, he began to reconfigure Beijing into a network of semi-autonomous enclaves, each under the control of the danwei - the work unit to which each citizen was assigned and the basic unit by which society was organised and controlled in the Communist era, both ideologically and physically.</p>
      <p>The traditional courtyard house was "a kind of loom, weaving individual lives into a typically Chinese social pattern"</p>
      <p>Each compound was to be self-sufficient, offering its residents housing, employment, education and healthcare, along with communal canteens and bath houses, creating miniature walled cities within the city. Intended to foster a sense of belonging and being part of a collective endeavour, it instead turned Beijing into a place of introverted islands, separated by competition and mutual distrust. It had the effect of atomising the previously vibrant urban society into a world of isolated cells, each citizen's loyalties tied to their danwei, which managed every aspect of their lives, from cradle to grave, issuing permits for marriage, divorce and even childbirth.</p>
      <p>Related: Story of cities #5: Benin City, the mighty medieval capital now lost without trace</p>
      <p>While the controlling power of the danwei has been progressively diluted, and the land holdings of state-owned enterprises increasingly sold off to private developers, the model of walled compounds continues in Beijing to this day. "Walls, walls, and yet again walls," was the reaction of Swedish art historian Osvald Sirén, when he visited China's capital in the 1920s. "They surround [the city], they divide it into lots and compounds, they mark more than any other structures the basic features of the Chinese communities."</p>
      <p>He was recounting his experience of walking the hutongs of old Beijing, within the limits of the city walls - which were demolished in the 1960s to build a subway line, above which the second ring road now rumbles - but he could have been describing driving past one of the many gated communities that have since sprung up across the city. These exclusive islands of themed villas and apartment blocks, surrounded by private schools and swimming pools, have a mirror image at the opposite end of the social spectrum, too.</p>
      <p>"Enhance the idea of safety and reduce illegal crimes," read a banner hanging over the main road to Shoubaozhuang, a village of 7,000 migrants to the south of Beijing - one of 16 such villages around the city that was subject to a programme of "sealed management" in 2010, their residents' routines controlled by a strict curfew. The ancient cosmological symbolism may long have fallen away from the streets of Beijing, but the role of city planning as a means of enforcing social order is as strong as ever.</p>

      <title>G2: Women: Hashtag for horror: Female protesters were beaten, raped and intimidated in a post-election crackdown by the Iranian authorities. Silenced by stigma and fear, these women are now using social media to bear witness to the horror, reports Julie Tomlin</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A young woman is speaking to the camera, her face obscured to prevent her being identified. Her voice heavy with emotion, and hands gesturing, she describes the rape and torture she endured at the hands of her guards while imprisoned during the post-election crackdown in Iran. "Death was my first wish," she says after recounting the physical and sexual assaults that began when she was picked up on her way home from university and thrown into a van. "I wanted it to be over. I wanted to die."</p>
      <p>Bruised from her beatings, she was taken to a detention centre where her interrogator told her, before he raped her: "I will do something you will never forget. I'll make it so you never want to leave your house again, so any time you hear my name, you will tremble." The young student was ordered to copy a "confession", which said she was a "rioter" and a terrorist who had endangered national security. "I didn't even have nail clippers in my purse for them to say I had anything remotely sharp or dangerous," the woman retorts. "All I had done was give one vote and that was to Mousavi. A vote that was never counted."</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old filming her statement is one of 300 women known to have been arrested in Iran since the disputed election of June 2009, when supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi took to the streets in protest against the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Some cases, such as that of film-maker Mahnaz Mohammadi and Maryam Majd, a photojournalist, have been criticised, but most, like that of the young student, are unlikely to attract international attention. "No one came to look for me. No one knew when they were raping me, or when they were burning me with cigarettes," she says.</p>
      <p>Few post-election detainees have spoken about about their experiences because they fear not only being re-arrested, but also the stigma of rape that exists in Iran. But social media is one way of bearing witness. The student's 100-minute testimony is the most detailed account of the treatment of prisoners in Iran since the crackdown began, says Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York based International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. A 28-minute segment of it has had more than 75,000 views and has been shared widely on social networks including Facebook and Twitter. It has opened up discussion about abuse, torture and rape of ordinary protesters, says Ghaemi, and fuelled his campaign to get the UN to hold Ahmadinejad to account for human rights abuses ahead of his appearance before the assembly in New York yesterday.</p>
      <p>"The regime has capitalised on not only the fear of retribution but also the social and cultural attitudes towards rape," explains Ghaemi. "Two years after the post-election crackdown, the Iranian regime is intent on erasing any memory and documentation of the widespread violence it unleashed against protesters. This young woman's testimony is a brave act of defiance against this trend."</p>
      <p>But the student is part of a younger generation of women who are more willing to challenge traditional attitudes about their position in society, says journalist and women's rights activist Parvin Ardalan. "Rape is something that is very difficult to talk about because of the attitude that exists, not only in Iran, that victims are to blame for what happens to them," she says. "But attitudes are slowly changing and women are starting to talk more. By going in front of a camera (the student) has challenged traditional thinking that if something happens to you, then you don't say anything.</p>
      <p>"Social media gave the young woman a voice, enabling her to speak out about her experience and encourage other women on the margins to follow her example, but the power of social media on its own is not enough," says Ardalan. "We still have to challenge the fact that when people hear what happens to her they are less likely to believe her because she is a woman, or that she might still be blamed for what happened to her."</p>
      <p>While victim-blaming is a problem women face around the globe, the consequences for women who speak out about rape can be deadly. Rana Husseini, a Jordan-based journalist whose book Murder in the Name of Honour is an investigation of so-called "honour killings" around the world, says: "Some women who are victims of rape could face extreme punishments that could lead to death not only because of the negative societal view of women who are raped, but because of the fact that they have lost their virginity in the process."</p>
      <p>The stigma has been such a barrier to women reporting rape in Libya that women's rights activists have said it is unlikely that the true extent of sexual violence against women will ever be known. The risks women face were illustrated dramatically when Iman al-Obeidi went to a Tripoli hotel in March this year and told foreign journalists there that she had been gang-raped by Muammar Gaddafi's troops. She was later denounced as a "whore" by the state TV presenter Hala Misrati who claimed a decent family would not spread news about their daughter's rape. "With time they may even kill the girl herself," she concluded.</p>
      <p>In Sudan, however, one woman has come forward to claim that she was kidnapped, assaulted and gang-raped by members of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services. Safiya Eshaq, a 25-year-old member of an anti-government youth group Grififna posted a video on YouTube earlier this year describing how she was attacked by secret intelligence police during protests in Khartoum. The fact that she did was brave enough - to do so with her face uncovered caught the attention of Sudan's media, which reported her claims. But Eshaq has since been forced to flee Khartoum and so far two journalists have been imprisoned and others are awaiting trial after they were accused of publishing Eshaq's "lies".</p>
      <p>In Egypt, where the power of social media was harnessed so effectively in the revolution, women are using video, blogs, Twitter and Facebook both to hold the authorities to account and to challenge attitudes that keep women silent about rape and sexual harassment. The fact that women prisoners were subjected to torture and "virginity tests" when they were arrested in Tahrir Square in March came to light because women such as Salwa-Al-Housiny Gouda were prepared to make statements in public meetings that were posted on YouTube. This determination to bring issues to light is behind Harassmap, a project that utilises open-source mapping technology to allow women to report incidents of sexual harassment by sending a text message. "It enables women to share their feelings anonymously but it also helps highlight the problem more, to bring it into the media spotlight and make the issue heard," says Harassmap co-founder Engy Ghozan.</p>
      <p>In partnership with Nazra, an organisation for feminist studies, Harassmap recently took part in a day of blogging and tweeting about sexual harassment, joining activists in Syria, Sudan and Lebanon. Both women and men took part, writing hundreds of blog posts in Arabic and English discussing the issue, commenting on a Facebook page and sending messages on Twitter using the hashtag #endSH in their tweet.</p>
      <p>Prominent activist Manal Hassan wrote: "The worst thing abt sexual harrasment is it's always looming over u. . it's not abt something happening, it's the constant fear of it."</p>
      <p>While the day of blogging helped raise awareness about the issue, some of the comments on Twitter suggesting that women are to blame and even encourage sexual harassment reveal the challenges ahead. "Perceptions need to change and we need to see an end to victim-blaming," says Ghozan. "The whole of society needs to start to take responsibility for the problem."</p>

      <title>G2: Meet the most dynamic political group in Britain. And yes, they make jam too: It is derided as an organisation for middle-aged women with too much time on their hands, but the list of achievements by the Women's Institute gets longer by the week. And now, writes Mimi Spencer, it is appealing to a whole new generation - Correction Appended</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The ladies of Wythit Women's Institute are learning to pole-dance. I allow myself the fleeting vision of a middle-aged treasurer writhing around wearing thigh boots and a come-hither smile. Enough to put you off your victoria sponge. But, thankfully, the WI at Wythit (they're actually from Leeming in Yorkshire, but have adopted the name for larks) boasts an average age of just 32. Something is clearly brewing in the tea-and- biscuit world of the WI.</p>
      <p>It might well have started with those Calendar Girls getting their kit off in 1999. It certainly got a boost when Tony Blair was thoroughly hand-bagged at the 2000 WI conference (never has a slow handclap felt more like a smack on the bottom). But since then, the WI has gone potty. They quad-bike. They abseil. They go-kart. And along the way they are advising the government on the safe disposal of nuclear waste.</p>
      <p>Despite its new-found edginess, the WI has seen its membership figures fall for the past three decades. Its average age remains firmly in the 50-60 bracket and the struggle is on to recruit a new group of women while dealing with something of an image problem.</p>
      <p>The WI is the Harvey's Bristol Cream, the Clarks sandal of the club world. "We associate these sorts of brands with the Britain of yesteryear," says Rita Clifton, of branding experts Interbrand. "They either need to turn around what people associate with the Women's Institute, or get a new name that is a truer signal of what they do."</p>
      <p>So what do they do? A quick glance at the local newsletter for one Bristol WI promises some must-go events (as in, "Gosh, is that the time? Must go"). There's a talk entitled "Norwegian Reflections"; another on "The History of Tea --the Cup that Cheers". In the WI magazine, Home and Country, the clash of traditional and modern is most striking: a feature debating designer-baby technology runs directly before a spread on "How to make a Chair Pillow". Few younger people have the time or the inclination to attend a lecture on the fascinating world of rugs. Anyone fancy entering a competition for "best tea tray on an international theme"? Thought not. One female friend tells me that she thinks the WI is for "mature ladies from the shires, vicars' wives, ex-headmistresses, ageing spinsters who live with their sisters - and my mate Lucy."</p>
      <p>I call her friend, Lucy Barker, a 39-year-old who has recently moved to Winchester. "Yes. I am the youngest member by some decades," she admits. "I almost did it as a counterculture move, to shock everyone. People fall off their chairs when I tell them I'm a WI member, and I love that."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the "youth" are indeed setting up their very own WIs. Wythit is one. Another is in Fulham. It meets at Novello's pub opposite Parsons Green tube station once a month and is led by Lucy Hutchings, 28.</p>
      <p>Hutchings is energetic, bright, enthusiastic. Head girl material. "We have 40 paid-up members, but a mailing list of 102," she explains. "We have women who are in asset management, PR, recruitment, a consultant at Deloitte &amp; Touche. A lot of us run our own businesses. I see the WI as a vehicle for whatever you want it to be. Being a woman, you just know you'll have common interests. And we meet at the pub, which is nice."</p>
      <p>It all sounds rather provocative and stimulating. I decide to phone up my local WI branch to partake in all the fun. Miss Filbert answers. "Ooh, lovely," she says when I ask about joining. "You can come along to our fair on the 19th. There will be craft stalls, a raffle and a tombola. It's £3 entry with a ploughman's lunch."</p>
      <p>I quickly explain that I might be a little younger than the usual intake, and Miss Filbert is thrilled. "Our youngest member moved to Torquay last year, and we do miss her terribly," she says.</p>
      <p>At the ploughman's event, there are trestle tables bearing peg bags and aprons and bootees knitted from lemon-coloured wool, surrounded by 30 elderly ladies. The president and secretary are warm and welcoming. I win a vinyl sponge bag in the tombola and find myself envying the woman who picked out number 28 and got a set of notelets Sellotaped to a china figurine of a shepherdess in a bonnet.</p>
      <p>A woman sidles up behind me as I am sizing up the butterfly cakes and says over my head, "You heard about June, then?" "Yes, terribly sad. Though a blessed relief."</p>
      <p>So far, so true to type. Yet, to write the WI off as a gaggle of old biddies is sorely to underestimate its power. Despite falling membership, it is the largest women's organisation in the UK, with 215,000-plus members - more than can be claimed by the Labour party. There are 7,000 WIs across England and Wales, and 49 new branches have opened so far this year. Though the figures are some way short of its 70s heyday, when the organisation boasted 500,000 members, last year saw the lowest fall in membership for 20 years.</p>
      <p>It's not just numbers that give the WI clout, either. This is an extremely efficient democratic, well-oiled fighting machine. As Helen Mirren says in Calendar Girls, "It's not just a load of middle-aged women standing mysteriously behind fruitcakes, you know." The WI has an unrivalled reputation as a campaigner on women's issues. In its 90-year history, the achievements of its members are staggering and worthy of report. They helped facilitate women's suffrage. They pressed for the greater availability of cervical smears. They called for the recognition of rape within marriage. In 1943, they demanded equal pay for equal work; in 1973, they convinced local authorities to provide a full and free family planning service. In 1975, they were on the case of battered women, urging state provision of refuges across the country. Did I mention that the WI was instrumental in the introduction of the family allowance, and in particular that it be paid direct to the mother? Or that it was a founding member of the Fairtrade Foundation? No wonder Jane Fonda, herself no slouch in the campaigning department, recently called the Women's Institute "an awesome organisation".</p>
      <p>Like a rottweiler in a pinny, the institute is a fearsome opponent. Look to any current, cutting-edge campaign, and the WI will be there. Its current gripes include third-world debt relief, climate change, trade justice and sustainable development. Last year, a gang of WI ladies in blazers and pearls descended on Brussels with a 77,000-strong petition calling for effective EU regulation of hazardous man-made chemicals. Somehow, between hanky competitions and tea talks, they find time to campaign on the supermarkets' code of conduct, oil dependency, renewable energy, GM crops. If you only ever spout off about the heinous iniquity of the world down the pub, then perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the importance of the Women's Institute.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the WI doesn't deal in party politics - just ask Tony Blair - but it's a dab hand at making things happen on an everyday level. WI members undertake more than 34 million hours of voluntary work in the community each year. A campaign to save a post office here. A tree-planting scheme there. Sustainable shopping bags; improved disabled access; a rural library protected; a hedgerow saved . . .</p>
      <p>It is a record of which Barbara Gill, chairman of the National Federation of Women's Institutes, is rightly proud (and yes, she's a chairman. None of this silly PC nonsense). Gill, a whirlwind in silk separates, recognises that the organisation took a dip when women entered the workplace in great numbers. "Perhaps there was a time when women started to go out to work and we lost them. But now I see the next generation, and I think: where have you got a voice?"</p>
      <p>Gill is convinced that the WI has something to offer us all, even the busy ones with kids and jobs and mortgages and roots that need doing. She soon warms to her theme and has an electrifying Lord Kitchener moment. "Young members want to run their meetings in a way that suits their lifestyle. Fine! If you can't join the one that meets during the day because you work, start one that meets on a Tuesday evening! Get in touch with us! We will help you do it!"</p>
      <p>Such can-do spirit is, of course, the defining mark of the WI lady. And she's right in spotting the younger generation's sense that something basic, earthy, rooty and real is missing from their lives. "There are gifts that come from both sides of the age divide, a sharing of skills," says Gill. "We have to recognise that many of our members are of the more mature age group. They have a lot to offer and share."</p>
      <p>Lucy Barker agrees. "I joined specifically to be around people from a different generation," she says. "I found that these women care about all the things I'm really passionate about - supermarket dominance, chemicals in the home, children and diet . . . I have found my local WI to be the absolute opposite of standoffish, conservative and gossipy. They're hugely interesting women - one was a university lecturer, another a very senior nurse - there's never a lack of things to talk about."</p>
      <p>To throw off some of their more olde-worlde associations, the WI has agreed to modernise some of its more arcane practices. The singing of Jerusalem at the beginning of each meeting, for example, is no longer mandatory - a matter of some regret for Hutchings ("I think you can never have too many opportunities to sing Jerusalem," she says, wistfully). New members are being encouraged to set up workplace meetings or get together virtually, online; Charlie Toothill of Wythit has proposed that the WI establish a presence at Glastonbury. As the columnist in Home and Country puts it: "Mrs Jenkins? Blogging? Whatever next?"</p>
      <p>What is undeniable is that women in their 20s and 30s are displaying a growing desire to engage more fully with their community. We want to know our neighbours. We want to know where our food has come from and where our rubbish is going. Perhaps it really is about time for a WI renaissance. There's a renewed interest, too, in crafts. Scrapbooking is now a $ 3bn worldwide industry. John Lewis runs very successful dressmaking seminars and knitting clinics: "There's not a wrinkly in sight," confides a spokeswoman, "They're all groovy young things." Recent research for the revamped She magazine found that making a birthday card or stitching a quilt "connects (women) with their female core nature and gives stability in a complex world". Domestic science repackaged as emotional therapy? OK, you might laugh into your latte, but there is a certain security in the domestic.</p>
      <p>The WI should, perhaps, capitalise on its home-and-hearth reputation rather than seek to sweep it under the carpet. There are wise old birds within the WI who have seen fashions come and go, and remain sanguine about the quad-biking, pole-dancing brigade. Watford member Sylvia Joyce, for instance, believes that women discover the WI when it fits their stage in life. "I don't think many young women will be interested," she says. "You've got too much in your life. (The WI) usually comes about when you retire or, like me, when you are widowed - we form a support network for each other."</p>
      <p>That, indeed, is true - and is perhaps the absolute heart of this remarkable organisation. Says Barbara Gill: "We must never underestimate the power of friendship and companionship. We need to show that, on the one hand, the WI is here to influence decision-makers; but on the other, it is a vehicle for women to meet, share friendships and enjoy each other's company."</p>
      <p>And if that's not enough, there's always the promise of a ploughman's and a nice strong cup of tea *</p>

      <title>Weekend: GIRLS' SECRETS, MEN'S MYTHS: Four novels, three prizes, two films - not bad for a writer whose first book spent 18 months in a box in his bedroom. But if his tale of a 21-year-old shopgirl was proclaimed a modern classic, why has Alan Warner abandoned her for two drunken, sexist Scotsmen? Melissa Denes finds out</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>All over Dublin, there are crocodiles of Catholic schoolgirls - teenagers in bottle green blazers and badges, their bare legs pale above bottle green socks. There are gangs of them in Boots, jamming the cosmetics aisle, and more loitering outside, shouting and screaming and lighting Silk Cuts. But Alan Warner, 6ft 3in, in black jeans and leather jacket, striding through town towards the nearest pub, doesn't seem to see them - which is odd when you consider that any one of them could have walked straight out of one of his books. In his debut, Morvern Callar, and in The Sopranos, his raucous book about a school choir trip, Warner showed us that he knew a thing or two about girls - about friendships and fallings-out, about matching leopard-print underwear, Dark Cherry nail polish, toe dividers and Rimmel eye liner. It's uncanny, the things this man knows.</p>
      <p>Physically, there is not much to hint at Warner's feminine side. He is a rangy, big-boned man of 37 -large hands, long legs, impressive cheekbones - with a sudden maniacal laugh. He likes a drink, and though he was up all hours with his editor last night, orders a midday Guinness and whiskey chaser at the gloomy wood-panelled bar. We talk about his new book, The Man Who Walks, a strange story about two Scotsmen - the Nephew and the eponymous Man Who Walks - who are following one another aimlessly, drunkenly, through the Highlands. There is no plot as such, but a lot of weird tales along the way: a British Rail stewardess who's eloped with her trolley, an American film crew location-scouting for a new version of Kidnapped, a stray dog with a band of paint around its middle. It's a book dense with stories - there are scenes of extreme violence and sexual deviance - but one that doesn't have an overriding story of its own. Warner talks about the book with great affection, as if it were written by someone else, but agrees that it's not a straightforward read - he never meant it to be. "It's an anti-novel, with anti-heroes. You're always attacking the form, taking the piss, in a sense. I can't think of a writer I respect who doesn't do that. And I've always been drawn to weird scenes and unstable personalities." For a while he didn't think he had an ending but then Annie Proulx, who has become a friend, gave him the idea. "She said (he affects a monotone Newfoundland accent), 'Well, Alan, that's a very sinister title for a book.' And I said, 'Why?' And she said, 'Because it implies that not all men do walk.' And there was my ending."</p>
      <p>Growing up in Oban on the west coast of Scotland, Warner never dreamed of being a writer. He knew he wanted to get out - everyone did - but literature, real literature, had to be about Paris or Rome or London, not people running wild in the hills. You couldn't make art from Oban and the miscreants, deviants and no-hopers who lived there. You certainly couldn't write a whole novel about a 21-year-old shopgirl who can scarcely read and thinks the Costa del Sol is the nearest thing to heaven on this earth. When he eventually did write this book, Morvern Callar, at the age of 25, it sat in a box in his bedroom for over a year. He just didn't think it was publishable: the person you would expect to narrate it - a middle-class, educated male novelist - is dead in the first sentence ("He'd cut His throat with the knife. He'd near chopped off His hand with the meat cleaver. He couldn't object so I lit a Silk Cut"). Since then, of course, Warner has proved himself wrong several times over, writing a series of books that centre on just this off-kilter world, a semi-fictional Oban, and Morvern Callar has become a modern classic.</p>
      <p>The breakthrough for him came, he says, with the publication of Duncan McLean's book of short stories, Bucket Of Tongues, in 1992, and Jeff Torrington's Swing Hammer Swing! which won the Whitbread the same year. Both proved that there was fiction to be made from contemporary Scotland, that there was poetry and pathos and a dark humour at work in Glasgow, Edinburgh and beyond. It was suddenly clear to Warner that Oban was brimful of material, and that Morvern Callar was a real book. He wrote a "shy" letter to Duncan McLean, and subsequently sent him a portion of Morvern Callar. McLean called his agent and within days the book had a publisher. So the book that had been shelved by its author for 18 months was sold inside a week.</p>
      <p>The early to mid-1990s saw something of a renaissance in Scottish fiction. Irvine Welsh published his debut Trainspotting in 1993, and the following year James Kelman won the Booker for How Late It Was, How Late. Morvern was published in 1995. Warner recalls being invited to a photo shoot for the New York Times magazine, along with Welsh, McLean, Gordon Legge and Kevin Williamson, and eventually being thrown out of the free bar provided by the paper - they wanted their Scottish writers authentic, but not too authentically drunk. The article that accompanied the photograph saluted "a new beer-soaked, drug-filled, profanity-laced, violently funny literature".</p>
      <p>Warner is ambivalent about the idea of a Scottish "scene". He is proud of his roots, and felt that a visible Scottish literature was lacking in the 1980s, but he doesn't like the notion that the Scots are some kind of novelty act, berserkers down from the hills with heather in their hair. His own writing is not so raw as that: the profanity is always offset by a tenderness, and by a poet's feel for weather and landscape. He can be scathing about London literary life and sees it as a self-perpetuating, self-congratulatory monster: it's all journalists, he says, rewarding other journalists. His advance for Morvern Callar was a pitiful pounds 3,000, and he remembers cornering a writer, an ex-journalist, at a party in London and badgering him to tell him the advance for his first novel, which ran into six figures - a levelling experience.</p>
      <p>He has become close to Irvine Welsh, but doesn't make too much of the literary connection. There was a time when they were both labelled "drugs" writers - they were youngish and wrote about drugs from first-hand experience - but the drugs in Warner's novels are far more incidental, not a way of life. He brings to his books no sense that drugs are intrinsically interesting, or exciting: they are special-occasion stimulants, just like cigarettes and coffee and alcohol. There is a scene in the new book in which the Nephew gets hopelessly, speechlessly stoned, but Warner is not a fan of dope himself. "I think the Nephew is one of the great marijuana bores of all time. I don't smoke, but the stuff your mates will come out with is just . . . frightful." He has taken a lot of ecstasy and acid in his time, and used to go to Edinburgh zoo to watch the animals, which he has described as better than a rave: "Cheaper admission, prettier girls, colourful parrots." The drug scene in the Highlands has got worse lately, he says: when he was at school, it was hard enough to score a smoke, but now they're doing smack and crack in the villages, and even the taxi drivers are stoned. What Warner does share with Welsh is an anarchic approach to narrative and form, and a scatological sense of humour: they are both wildly uninhibited writers, richly demotic, "drawn to weird scenes and unstable personalities".</p>
      <p>Warner's childhood was something of a weird scene, although he prefers to describe it as idyllic. He lived with his parents in a hotel with 40 bedrooms, on a hill above the port. "It was this incredible thing, like a palace. It would close for winter and I'd get to know every room, the difference between every door handle - it was a real world of the imagination. I'd have my pal over and we'd play secret agents, me starting at the top, him at the bottom, and we'd hunt each other down. These hunts would last 45 minutes! You can imagine the tension." At primary school he was "a bit of a wee character", in a Jaws T-shirt and baseball cap, "which in those days no one had. I'd put my shirt across the J and the S of Jaws so it would spell AW, for Alan Warner. So I was always being teased, but really it was a very happy time."</p>
      <p>In his teens, Warner clashed with his father - "An ex-sergeant major, a very heavy drinker, we were on different trips. I was the middle-class child of working-class parents, who made good money in the 1970s. My father drove Jaguars, new ones. He was a self-made man and I was this hopeless case, a breakaway at 16." He skived off school and spent his days smoking cigarettes with his girlfriend, before moving to London, where he studied at Ealing College. He went to Glasgow University, where he wrote a thesis on Joseph Conrad and suicide. And then he drifted, hanging out on the Spanish rave scene, working in a series of blue-collar jobs in Scotland - barman, bouncer, jazz bass guitarist, train driver. "I was trying to be a bohemian, which is what I've always wanted to be, really - it's a dying art form." He started to write bits and pieces - poetry, short stories. One magazine editor recalls Warner submitting a poem with a short autobiographical note. When he wrote back to say the prose was more striking than the poem, Warner resubmitted the footnote in verse form: 'A. Warner born Oban. In his mid-twenties, Alan is a/Guaranteed Free Range Poet with twenty four hour access/To open pasture."</p>
      <p>He could have gone on like this, he says, working long weeks on the railways, out of it at the weekends, all the while not especially happy, until he had something of a catharsis while on holiday in Spain. "We were all pretty wasted. Me and some girls took off our clothes and we swam out to sea. It was a beautiful night. Suddenly I got this fear, this incredible fear, the stars above, the dark sea underneath, and this feeling that I was going to be grabbed - an incredible emptiness. I turned around and swam further out, up the highway of the moon, and then I closed my eyes and swam down. I blew out all the air and opened my eyes and I was just floating over the seabed with this roof of moon above me. I didn't know which way to go, but then I came back up, and I was happy."</p>
      <p>He went home to Scotland, stopped going out at the weekends, and spent every moment he had bashing out Morvern Callar on an old typewriter. He wrote the epiphany off a Spanish beach into the book, making it Morvern's: "All was made of darknesses . . . legs hung in that huge deep under me and the layer on layer and fuzzy mush of star pinpricks were above with the little buzz of me in between." The rest we know: the manuscript collecting dust in the house, the shy letter to Duncan McLean, the rapid two-book deal, for Morvern Callar and a sequel, These Demented Lands.</p>
      <p>Warner's most brilliant creation, Morvern Callar is a completely unforgettable character. The reader is never told what she looks like, only that she has glitter under the skin of one knee and "the face of an angel"; nor do we know what she thinks, about anything. She is perfectly blank, living 100% in the moment, observing but never feeling. "She subverts what the novel is supposed to be about, the interior life of a character. Everything is a screen - the reason she tells you every texture in the food she's eating, every colour, is because she doesn't want to tell you what she's really feeling. There's a sense of, you're not worthy, I am above you." Warner says he gets more like Morvern as time goes by. "If I'm ever stuck, I'll think, 'What would Morvern do?' and it's always the right answer."</p>
      <p>The book has now been made into a film by Lynne Ramsay, with Samantha Morton as Morvern, due for release this autumn. It was a tricky book to film, says Warner: there is so little dialogue, and Morvern reveals so little of herself. He and Ramsay were both agreed there should be no voiceover. "Samantha had to give a reading of the book at a festival, and I said to her, 'God, Sam, how did you do it?' and she said, 'As if I were reading a statement to the Old Bill.' And I think that's exactly right. It's a sort of confession."</p>
      <p>When did he get so good at writing girls? His familiarity with female behaviour and private ritual is frankly spooky. He seems to have been places boys aren't invited - locked toilet cubicles, single-sex classrooms, teenage bedrooms. He gets the dialogue just right: in The Sopranos, one girl complains of another, "Sometimes she's a bit tartishly bimboic." And who else, male or female, could have written the following description of a Saturday night get-up: "Tan toe-nail varnish, ma hair slicked back and glossed, with a parting, and tan eyeshadow, a totty wee sliver of silver cross top of the eyelids here, lighter on the bottom then a coat of black under that, mascara and dark colour lipliner, tan lipstick to go with ma nails an toes then a glisteny lipgloss on top"? It's not just that Warner is good at the detail: he seems to see girls and young women as the personification of youth, of pure unadulterated life force. The epigraph to The Sopranos quotes from Wuthering Heights, "They do live more in earnest" and this could be said of any one of Warner's female characters.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it's not the case with his men, who tend to be shadowier or, in The Man Who Walks, more beaten by life. Warner has a much younger sister, and an even younger wife - Hollie, who he met in Spain and married when she was 19 and he was 32 - but he doesn't accept that he has any special insight into the female psyche. "You see it every day, it's all there," he shrugs. "I don't like football, so as a teenager I'd hang out with the girls on Saturday afternoons. But really I'm a sexist pig like all men." This is demonstrably untrue - sexist pigs don't write haunting female characters, they wouldn't notice the things he does - but you have to assume Warner doesn't want to be stuck with Morvern and the Sopranos for ever. Also, as he points out, the narrators of the new book really are sexist pigs.</p>
      <p>If Warner is now officially a success - four novels, three prizes, two films (he is currently working on a Sopranos script for the Scottish director Michael Caton-Jones) - his main concern is not to become predictable, a slave to a genre of his own creating. In this sense, he says, it's fortunate that writing never gets any easier: "It's still the same daily struggle with words on the page. You can't be smug. You don't know if you'll ever write another book, no writer does, so it's the same feeling now as it was when I wrote Morvern Callar."</p>
      <p>Home is now Dublin - Hollie is half-Irish, half-Spanish, and has family nearby, and the city appeals to an appetite for outsider status and for literary heroes. "I'm just a huge tourist. I go around looking up at Beckett's house and Joyce's house, and the chemist where Leopold Bloom bought a bar of soap in Ulysses, stuff like that." He has two more novels on the go - a long book about a Spanish businessman with HIV and a shorter book about an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman (not a joke, I think) who go to Spain to build swimming pools, the Costa Pool Bums. He writes every day, mostly in longhand, and thinks writer's block is a middle-class, Londoner's affliction. Himself, he sees stories everywhere, and after all those years of thinking they were the wrong sort (too perverse, too far-fetched, too Scottish), he is getting them down. A shame he missed those schoolgirls, though</p>
      <p>The Man Who Walks, by Alan Warner, is published by Jonathan Cape on May 30, priced pounds 10.99. To order a copy for pounds 8, plus p&amp;p, call the Guardian book service on 0870 066 7979.</p>

      <title>Food: Silly burgers: Last week a burger war broke out in New York, with two restaurants battling it out to make the most expensive. Oliver Burkeman samples the winner - a Dollars 50 hunk of beef with a nugget of foie gras embedded within - and wonders if this craze for overpriced food will last</title>

    <text>
      <p>If there was ever a time when it would not have been preposterous and even vaguely obscene for a New York restaurant to introduce the world's most expensive hamburger, priced at Dollars 50 (pounds 32), now is not that time. Stocks are down; the internet boom is a memory; the city is in debt; war is on the horizon. This is not the era of Gordon Gekko and Wall Street. It is the era of the dollar menu at McDonald's.</p>
      <p>But New York food fads obey no known economic laws, and DB Bistro Moderne, the restaurant owned by French-American chef Daniel Boulud on West 44th Street in midtown Manhattan, exists in a parallel universe where the Dow is always high. The four jowly businessmen at the table next to ours spoke of strip clubs, high-end restaurants, and the new Lexus SUV.</p>
      <p>The waiter took us through the specials, lingering on a mouthwatering dish involving merguez sausages, but pretty much everyone eating was there for the same reason. "I think we've already decided," I said, a bit apologetically. "Two burgers," he said. It wasn't a question.</p>
      <p>The Manhattan burger frenzy began last week, when the Old Homestead, a renowned steakhouse in the Meatpacking District, broke with decades of tradition and put its first hamburger on the menu. It costs Dollars 41 and is made from Japanese Kobe beef. Kobe cows are massaged daily, causing the fat to mingle with the meat, and resulting in a burger of unsurpassed tenderness. They also drink beer. Beer and massages: it is not clear that any philosopher ever defined the good life more accurately than this. Apart from the getting killed part, obviously.</p>
      <p>But the Old Homestead's moment came to an end when news of Boulud's rival started to circulate. The DB Burger Royale is heartstopping, in both the literal and figurative sense of the word: a fresh-baked, toasted Parmesan-and-poppy-seed bun encasing three inches of beef and short ribs braised in red wine, with a nugget of foie gras embedded within. Either side, along with the tomato confit, chicory and fresh horseradish, is a sliver of black Perigord truffle - which, at Dollars 350 per pound, accounts for much of the price.</p>
      <p>The resident chef at DB Bistro Moderne, Jean-Francois Bruel, is putting a brave face on the burger explosion, said Georgette Farkas, Boulud's marketing director. "He's an award-winning chef in his own right, so I think he was just a very little bit frustrated - he would love people to try the other things he does. But the Frenchmen who are successful in America are the ones who embrace the best of what is American and what is French and combine it."</p>
      <p>Ironically, Farkas said, it was Jose Bove, sworn enemy of the fast-food burger, who inspired Boulud's first adventure into the archetypal American meal. His original Dollars 29 burger happened, she said, "because Daniel was asked in an interview what he made of the unfortunate attacks against McDonald's in France. He said, 'The French are just jealous that they didn't invent the hamburger themselves.' " That gave him an idea. "He decided he would make his own version. It's not a typical American burger, not at all - it's equal parts French and American."</p>
      <p>Indeed, there are those who have argued that Boulud's creation is not really a hamburger at all - though it has been spared a judgment such as the one that Ed Levine, author of the city food shopping bible New York Eats, delivered on the Old Homestead burger in the New York Times. "It is genuinely lousy," he wrote, "a mushy, gray thing of loose consistency and little flavour."</p>
      <p>But Manhattan's passing culinary frenzies have rarely been about strict definitions, or even the quality of the food. The compact geography of the place, its residents' relative wealth, and its diners' reliance on a tiny handful of opinion-forming publi cations, combine to create fads that electrify the city for a day, or a week, and then vanish as fast as they arrived. Just last year, gastronomes scoured Chinatown for tubs containing illegal snakehead fish, the terrifying but allegedly tasty monsters capable of crawling out of rivers and slithering over land, surviving outside the water for up to three days. Vendors started charging even to photograph them.</p>
      <p>And price is just another selling-point. You can't buy publicity like that received by the French chef Alain Ducasse when he opened his restaurant of the same name in New York in 1999. Rumours of dinners for two costing Dollars 600 attracted the city's newspapers, and with a prix-fixe menu costing upwards of Dollars 160, plus wines weighing in at Dollars 100 and more, with after-dinner coffee at Dollars 8, the rumours turned out to be true. Customers flocked. They are paying for the quality, to be sure - but they are also paying for the price. In this, the DB Burger Royale is no different.</p>
      <p>What was it like? Delicious, obviously. Very juicy, pleasingly soft but still chewable, the truffle and beef flavours offsetting each other intriguingly, though it is never nice to think too hard about foie gras.</p>
      <p>But the next afternoon, I was on a trip in the woods, in sub-zero temperatures, when we stopped, freezing and famished, at a cheap smalltown diner for a cheeseburger and fries. The meat was nothing special, the cheese processed; the whole thing cost about seven dollars. It was the best food I'd eaten in months.</p>
      <p>I don't think I should ever be a restaurant critic.</p>

      <p>block-time published-time 10.45pm GMT</p>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <p>Here is a recap of the main developments from the last few hours:</p>
      <p>Portugal announced an expansion of a nightly curfew and weekend lockdown already in place across more than 100 municipalities to a further 77 areas as it scrambles to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>The UK government said a further 563 people had diedwithin 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, bringing the official tally to 50,928. However, separate figures from the UK's statistics agencies, which take into account all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, put the death toll at almost 67,000.</p>
      <p>The Chicago mayor, Lori Lightfoot, issued a 30-day advisory telling residents to stay at home and not to have visitors in the home, including for Thanksgiving. If residents travel out of the state, they must quarantine for 14 days or submit a negative virus test, she said.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland's power-sharing government has agreed to extend Covid-19 restrictions for between one and two weeks, falling short of stricter measures demanded by Irish nationalist parties. The five-party power-sharing executive agreed the reopening of cafes and close-contact services such as hairdressers will be delayed by a week and the reopening of bars and restaurants serving alcohol will be delayed by two weeks.</p>
      <p>Italy recorded 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours - its highest daily figure since 6 April. The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with Wednesday - up from 32,961 to 37,978. The northern region of Lombardy remains the hardest-hit area.</p>
      <p>France's lockdown is to last for at least two more weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave, the prime minister, Jean Castex, told a news conference. He said that if the current slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week but that if the spread of infections began to accelerate he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures.</p>
      <p>Iran's death toll from the coronavirus has risen above 40,000 after 457 more fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The number of people who have died from Covid in Iran, which has the highest death count in the Middle East, now stands at 40,121.</p>
      <p>A senior health department official in Delhi has said that Diwali, starting on 14 November, could be "a super spreader event". India has so far reported about 8.6 million coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711.</p>
      <p>A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - is to appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches. Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug, which has been trumpeted by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Russia, Croatia, Greece were among countries to report respective daily records in the number of infections.</p>
      <p>Germany is seeing tentative signs that a surge in coronavirus infections may be easing, officials said today. "The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). He said it showed anti-transmission measures were working but warned there was still scope for the situation to deteriorate in coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Refusing to allow coronavirus to steal his Christmas, one Bavarian innkeeper has opened a drive-through Christmas market, complete with artificial snow that falls as you come in, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>Some 2,500 Christmas markets are usually held in Germany in the lead-up to the holiday, drawing millions of visitors who sip mulled wine and buy trinkets among wooden huts. But most markets are likely to be cancelled this year due to the pandemic, including Nuremberg's world-famous "Christkindlesmarkt."</p>
      <p>Five months after Patrick Schmidt condensed the Bavarian "Dult" folk festival experience into a drive-through delight during the first wave of the pandemic, he is now trying to recreate the Christmas market feeling while sticking to guidelines for social distancing.</p>
      <p>"It was a spontaneous idea because of the second lockdown. I thought the Dult drive-in also worked so why not a Christmas market drive-in?" he beamed at the market's opening on Thursday in Landshut, some 60km (37 mile) northeast of Munich. "We don't just sell a crepe or a pack of roasted almonds, we sell an experience."</p>
      <p>Patrons said the market comes as a welcome boost as the country grinds through a month-long "lockdown light" under which bars, restaurants, theatres and museums have been closed.</p>
      <p>"I heard Christmas carols for the first time and I'm slowly getting into the mood," said Anton Kolbinger, holding cotton candy. "But to get into a real Christmas mood will still take some time."</p>
      <p>Schmidt said he already knows what he wants for Christmas:</p>
      <p>My biggest Christmas wish is that the coronavirus is finally brought under control and that next year is half-way normal again. That's what I hope for.</p>

      <p>People from Black and Asian backgrounds are at substantially greater risk of contracting Covid-19 than white people, according to a study that highlights the disproportionate impact of the disease on different groups in society.</p>
      <p>Black people are twice as likely to become infected with coronavirus as white people, and people from Asian backgrounds are one and a half times as likely, researchers found after analysing 50 studies that reported on the medical records of nearly 19 million Covid patients.</p>
      <p>The analysis, published in the journal EClinicalMedicine by the Lancet, is the first comprehensive, systematic review of published research and preliminary papers that delve into the burden of coronavirus on different ethnic groups. About half of the papers have appeared in peer-reviewed journals and the rest are preliminary findings.</p>
      <p>Beyond the raised risk of infection, the review suggests people from Asian backgrounds are more likely to be admitted to intensive care and may have a greater risk of death with coronavirus than white people. But the researchers cautioned that none of the studies on intensive care admissions had been peer-reviewed and that the increased risk of death was only borderline statistically significant.</p>

      <p>Nearly 67,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have now occurred in the UK, the latest figures from the UK's statistics agencies show. These are separate from the figures gathered by the UK government, which only take into account deaths from Covid-19 where a person has died within 28 days of a positive test (see 8.05pm. ).</p>
      <p>According to the most recent reports from the Office for National Statistics, the National Records of Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, a total of 63,317 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.</p>
      <p>But since those figures were compiled, a further 3,195 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 33 in Scotland, 220 in Wales and 110 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the UK government's coronavirus dashboard.</p>
      <p>Together, these totals mean that so far there have been 66,875 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK.</p>

      <p>Father Christmas wears a mask and can travel the world thanks to a special permit, Italy's prime minister said on Thursday, in a bid to ease children's fears that Santa may also be under lockdown this year.</p>
      <p>Giuseppe Conte wrote on Facebook:</p>
      <p>Father Christmas assured me that he already has an international travel certificate: he can travel everywhere and distribute gifts to all the world's children.</p>
      <p>He was responding to a desperate letter by five-year-old Tommaso who had pleaded with him not to confine Babbo Natale, as Santa is known in Italy. Conte said:</p>
      <p>He confirmed to me that he always uses a mask and maintains a correct distance to protect himself and everyone he meets.</p>
      <p>He then suggested to the boy that he put a bottle of hand sanitising gel under the tree, along with warm milk and biscuits. The Italian PM continued:</p>
      <p>I'm letting you know that it won't be necessary to tell Father Christmas that you were good in your letter, because I already told him.</p>
      <p>I also found out that you wanted to ask Father Christmas to chase away the coronavirus. Don't forget to ask for another present.</p>
      <p>Italy, the first European country hit by coronavirus earlier this year, has recorded a surge in cases in recent weeks and has topped one million infections in total.</p>
      <p>Several types of restrictions have been imposed nationwide and at a local level, depending on the health situation in different regions. But a growing number of medical workers and politicians are calling for stricter measures, and even a second nationwide lockdown.</p>
      <p>Whatever the evolution of the pandemic in the coming weeks, the regional affairs minister Francesco Boccia said on Thursday that Christmas would only be celebrated among close family members.</p>

      <p>The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the nation in two videos on Thursday, his first appearance since being hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19 this week.</p>
      <p>Sitting in a chair in front of a Ukrainian flag, Zelenskiy said he felt good and the government was working as normal. He also spoke about his administration's standoff with the Constitutional Court over anti-corruption reforms.</p>
      <p>The president, 42, was moved to hospital to self-isolate and not put others at risk, his office said.</p>
      <p>Three other top officials, including the finance minister, the defence minister and Zelenskiy's top aide were also reported to be infected.</p>
      <p>"As you know, Covid-19 has not avoided me, but I feel good," Zelenskiy said.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian new coronavirus infections began rising in late September and have remained consistently high in October and November, prompting the government to extend some restrictions until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Zelenskiy's cabinet voted to impose a national lockdown at weekends to strengthen steps to curb the rapid spread of infection.</p>
      <p>Ukraine has registered a total of 500,865 coronavirus cases and 9,145 deaths as of Thursday.</p>

      <p>Portugal expands nightly curfew and weekend lockdown to more areas</p>
      <p>Portugal has announced an expansion of a nightly curfew and weekend lockdown already in place across more than 100 municipalities to a further 77 areas as it scrambles to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>"The situation is serious and more critical than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic," the prime minister Antonio Costa told a news conference.</p>
      <p>Residents of affected areas are asked to not leave the house except for work, school or shopping during the week, and must stay home between 11pm and 5am.</p>
      <p>At weekends, a lockdown is in place from 1pm to 5am, during which all commercial outlets and restaurants must shut, although there are exceptions for bakeries, pharmacies and neighbourhood grocery shops.</p>
      <p>Restaurants will be able to apply for compensation of 20% of their average revenues to make up for income lost over the next two weekends, Costa announced, after workers in areas where the weekend lockdown was already in place protested that it was killing the sector.</p>
      <p>AHRESP, an association representing the hotel and restaurant sector, said 49,000 businesses had been wiped out between July and September.</p>
      <p>Any municipality with more than 240 new cases per 100,000 people in the space of two weeks must follow the new rules. Seven were removed in the past week as their infection rate fell below the threshold.</p>
      <p>A nationwide state of emergency that came into force on Monday and is due to last until 23 November could also be extended if necessary.</p>
      <p>Portugal, with just over 10 million people, has recorded a comparatively low 191,011 cases and 3,181 deaths. However, last Saturday the number of daily infections hit 6,640, the highest figure since the pandemic started, albeit with an expanded testing programme.</p>
      <p>Costa said:</p>
      <p>The least we owe healthcare professionals is to make an additional effort. The rule is simple: We have to stay at home.</p>

      <p>UK records another 563 deaths, taking official toll to 50,928</p>
      <p>The UK government said a further 563 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday. That brings the official tally to 50,928. Though lower than the 595 deaths reported on Wednesday - the highest daily figure recorded since early May - it is still well above 500 and the seven-day average for deaths is running at 375, compared to 295 a week ago.</p>
      <p>Taking into account all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the UK's death toll is actually now almost 67,000.</p>
      <p>It comes as the UK recorded 33,470 further coronavirus cases - a new daily record, and more than 10,000 greater than the total for Wednesday. The figure is also more than 6,000 above the previous highest daily total. The seven-day average for new cases is now running at 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago.</p>

      <p>Lightfoot issued a 30-day advisory that will begin on Monday, calling upon residents to stay at home and not to have visitors, even for Thanksgiving. If residents travel out of the state, they must quarantine for 14 days or submit a negative virus test, she said during a news conference.</p>

      <p>Northern Ireland 's power-sharing government has agreed to extend Covid-19 restrictions for between one and two weeks, falling short of stricter measures demanded by Irish nationalist parties, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>In mid-October, Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to reimpose strict Covid-19 constraints, closing schools for two weeks and bars and restaurants for four, but the measures were due to lapse on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been pushing for a swift end to the restrictions to help small-business owners, but the rival Ulster Unionists and Irish nationalist parties Sinn Féin and the SDLP said high infection rates meant restrictions should be maintained.</p>
      <p>Under a compromise between the DUP, the UUP and the non-sectarian Alliance party, the five-party power-sharing executive agreed the reopening of cafes and close-contact services such as hairdressers will be delayed by a week and the reopening of bars and restaurants serving alcohol will be delayed by two weeks.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin voted against the measures, while the SDLP abstained.</p>
      <p>"The advice was that we needed a further two-week restriction [on cafes and close-contact services] and that's what we would have wanted to see," Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O'Neill, told UTV television.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland has reported 825 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, including 15 reported on Thursday. It has had just over 200 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, around three times the rate in the Republic of Ireland, which has fallen sharply since strict measures were introduced.</p>

      <p>Summary</p>
      <p>I'm handing over the blog to my colleague Lucy Campbell now. I'll leave you with a summary of the latest developments:</p>
      <p>Italy recorded 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours - its highest daily figure since 6 April. The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with Wednesday - up from 32,961 to 37,978. The northern region of Lombardy remains the hardest-hit area.</p>
      <p>France's lockdown is to last for at least two more weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave, the prime minister, Jean Castex, told a news conference. He said that if the current slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week but that if the spread of infections began to accelerate he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures.</p>
      <p>Iran's death toll from the coronavirus has risen above 40,000 after 457 more fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The number of people who have died from Covid in Iran, which has the highest death count in the Middle East, now stands at 40,121.</p>
      <p>A senior health department official in Delhi has said that Diwali, starting on 14 November, could be "a super spreader event". India has so far reported about 8.6 million coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711.</p>
      <p>A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - is to appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches. Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug, which has been trumpeted by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>Russia, Croatia, Greece were among countries to report respective daily records in the number of infections.</p>
      <p>Germany is seeing tentative signs that a surge in coronavirus infections may be easing, officials said today. "The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). He said it showed anti-transmission measures were working but warned there was still scope for the situation to deteriorate in coming weeks.</p>

      <p>Greece reported 3,316 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, its highest daily tally since its first infection surfaced in February, according to health authorities data.</p>
      <p>The latest jump in infections brings the total number of cases in the country to 66,637.</p>
      <p>It also registered 50 deaths, bringing the number of victims since the onset of the virus to 959.</p>
      <p>A resurgence in cases since early October has forced Greece to reimpose a nationwide lockdown until the end of the month.</p>

      <p>Donald Trump's adviser Corey Lewandowski has become the latest member of the outgoing president's staff to test positive for coronavirus.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski recently traveled to Pennsylvania to assist Trump's efforts to contest the state's election results. He said today he believes he was infected in Philadelphia and is not experiencing any symptoms.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski appeared with Rudy Giuliani at an event on Saturday outside a landscaping company and lobbed unfounded accusations of voter fraud as the race was called for Trump's challenger, now-President-elect Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski was also at the election night party at the White House last week linked to several virus cases.</p>
      <p>Numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive in this latest wave of infections, including Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows.</p>

      <p>France lockdown to last at least two more weeks The French prime minister, Jean Castex, speaks during a press conference at the French health ministry. Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images</p>
      <p>The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said there would be no easing of a second Covid-19 lockdown in France for at least two weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave.</p>
      <p>Castex said that one in four deaths in the country were due to the virus and that while the R number was now below 1, it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures. He told a news conference:</p>
      <p>It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now. The gains (we are seeing) are fragile.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said that if the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But he said he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread of infections quickened once more.</p>
      <p>The virus has killed more than 42,000 people in France. Health authorities reported 35,879 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 1.86 million, overtaking Russia and making France the worst-affected country in the European region. "The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously," the French prime minister said.</p>
      <p>Authorities could ease restrictions for Christmas holidays if conditions allow, Castex said.</p>

      <p>Top Democrats in the US Congress today urged renewed negotiations over a multitrillion-dollar coronavirus aid proposal, but the top Republican immediately rejected their approach as too expensive, continuing a months-long impasse.</p>
      <p>The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, ticked off a litany of grim data about the spread of the coronavirus in the US, with eight straight days of over 100,000 new coronavirus cases being reported each day.</p>
      <p>"It's like the house is burning down and they just refuse to throw water on it," Pelosi said of Republicans.</p>
      <p>She and Schumer told a news conference that President-elect Joe Biden's victory strengthened the Democratic position, which is to spend at least $2.2tn on another round of coronavirus aid, on top of $3tn Congress has approved since the pandemic began. The Republican president, Donald Trump, has not conceded to Biden.</p>
      <p>"We're willing to sit down and talk; they haven't wanted to talk," Schumer said, referring to the post-election session of Congress that lasts until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaking to reporters in a hallway a few minutes later, said he preferred previous Republican proposals in the range of $500bn.</p>
      <p>"I gather she [Pelosi] and the Democratic leader in the Senate still are looking at something dramatically larger. That's not a place I think we're willing to go," McConnell said.</p>
      <p>"But I do think there needs to be another package," the Republican said. "Hopefully we can get past the impasse."</p>
      <p>In May, the Democratic-majority House approved an additional $3.4tn in coronavirus aid, but it went nowhere in McConnell's Senate, where Schumer's Democrats blocked less expensive Republican proposals.</p>

      <p>Germany 's health minister said today that he expected restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic to continue through winter, with life unlikely to get back to normal in December or January even if infections fall.</p>
      <p>"I don't see events with more than 10 or 15 people happening this winter," Jens Spahn told the broadcaster RBB.</p>
      <p>Germany reported 21,866 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 727,553 and jumping back above 20,000 after four days below that figure, while the death toll rose by 215 to 11,982, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>The chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of Germany's states are due to meet on Monday to review whether partial lockdown measures imposed on 2 November have been enough to slow a steep rise in new infections that risks overwhelming hospitals.</p>
      <p>"We all have to be sensible, we have to get down to 50 cases per 100,000 people over seven days," Merkel said today in response to a question on whether the lockdown would end this month. The figure is currently 139 per 100,000.</p>
      <p>Unlike its first lockdown earlier this year, Germany is keeping its schools and daycare centres open so that parents can go to work, limiting damage to the economy, although at least 300,000 pupils and 40,000 teachers are currently in quarantine.</p>
      <p>Prof Lothar Wieler, the head of the RKI, said on Thursday that he expected rules to slow the spread of the pandemic in Germany to remain in place for a long while, as a vaccination would take time and there was likely to be an uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 in some parts of the country.</p>
      <p>The slowing dynamic of infections gave ground for cautious optimism, but it was not yet clear whether this was a stable development, and hospitals were still expected to reach capacity, Wieler added.</p>

      <p>Danish vaccine 'effective against mink Covid strain'</p>
      <p>A potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said today.</p>
      <p>Authorities last week embarked on a plan to cull Denmark's 17 million mink, one of the world's largest populations, before running into opposition to the cull. It followed concerns that a recently discovered strain found in mink farms and humans could evade future Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
      <p>Early studies of the mutated virus strain, known as Cluster 5, showed the virus to have a reduced sensitivity towards antibodies, possibly compromising the efficacy of future vaccines, authorities said last week.</p>
      <p>But antibodies from rabbits treated with an early-stage vaccine candidate from Denmark's State Serum Institute (SSI) successfully beat down the Cluster 5 variant, according to Anders Fomsgaard, lead scientist at SSI, which deals with infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>"We couldn't resist testing the rabbit antibodies we have against Cluster 5, and it works," he told Danish broadcaster DR.</p>
      <p>The vaccine candidate, which is in early stages of development, will soon move to human trials at which it is uncertain if it will have the same effect.</p>
      <p>"Whether this also applies to other vaccines and whether it applies to human antibodies, we do not know," Fomsgaard said. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a risk assessment today there is "currently high uncertainty" about the potential threat posed by the spread of the virus into mink, its mutations, and its consequent spread back into people.</p>

      <p>Italy reports highest daily deaths since 6 April</p>
      <p>Italy has registered 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours, up from 623 the day before and the highest figure since 6 April, the health ministry said.</p>
      <p>The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with the previous day - up from 32,961 on Wednesday to 37,978.</p>
      <p>Infections in Italy since the disease first came to light in February total 1.066m, while 43,589 people have died to date because of the coronavirus.</p>
      <p>There were 234,672 coronavirus swabs carried out in the past day, the ministry said, against a previous 225,640. The northern region of Lombardy, centred on Italy's financial capital Milan, remained the hardest hit area on Thursday, reporting 9,291 new cases, up from Wednesday's 8,180</p>

      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci says unprecedented "polarisation" has intensified an anti-science feeling in the US and led people to threaten violence against him.</p>
      <p>While the top infectious diseases expert commands respect among much of the public, he has received personal death threats as a result of his high-profile statements about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>The health expert Prof David Heymann, who joined Fauci in a Chatham House webinar, said science had become highly politicised to the point that a mask wearer was seen as a Democrat and a non-mask wearer as a Republican.</p>

      <p>New infections and hospital admissions have surged in Sweden as the country battles a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that officials had hoped its light-touch, anti-lockdown approach would mitigate, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian's Europe correspondent.</p>
      <p>"We consider the situation extremely serious," the director of health and medical care services for Stockholm, Björn Eriksson, told the state broadcaster SVT this week. "We can expect noticeably more people needing hospital care over the coming weeks."</p>
      <p>Swedish hospitals were treating 1,004 patients for Covid-19, SVT said, an increase of 60% over the previous week's 627. Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggests the rise in recent weeks may be Europe's fastest.</p>
      <p>New infections are also rising, hitting a seven-day average of more than 4,000 this week against fewer than 500 at the beginning of October. The country recorded 4,635 new infections on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Since the start of the pandemic Sweden - which at one stage in June had Europe's highest per-capita Covid-19 fatality rate - has confirmed 171,365 cases of infections and 6,122 deaths. Its death toll per capita is many times higher than its Nordic neighbours, but lower than countries such as Italy, Spain and the UK.</p>

      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is in discussions with the Russian institute that developed the Sputnik V candidate vaccine against Covid-19 over its potential application for emergency use listing, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the Canadian-owned news agency, the WHO said: "We look forward to receiving the data for their Sputnik V candidate vaccine. If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, WHO will publish the results widely."</p>
      <p>By granting the vaccine emergency-use listing, the WHO would effectively be recommending its use to member states.</p>
      <p>Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results, Russia's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Russian Direct Investment Fund submitted the application for emergency-use listing late last month, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.</p>

      <p>All schools and other educational institutions in Bangladesh will remain closed until 19 December, the education ministry has said, as the country fears a resurgence of coronavirus infections this winter.</p>
      <p>The announcement is the latest extension of the schools closure imposed across the country on 17 March. A senior ministry spokesman, who was not named, told Reuters: "The decision has been taken considering the second wave... We can't play with the lives of our children."</p>
      <p>The government, however, has lifted most other restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Daily infections have shown a rising trend this month, with 1,845 new cases and 13 deaths reported on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh has so far recorded 427,198 coronavirus infections and 6,140 deaths from Covid-19. That gives the country of 164.7 million people an infection rate of 25,101 per million and a Covid-19 death rate of 37 per million, according to the Worldometers website.</p>
      <p>Nazrul Islam, a virologist and member of the national technical advisory committee to tackle Covid-19, said:</p>
      <p>The government took the right decision. The coronavirus situation could worsen further in the winter when viral and bacterial diseases increase... People are eager for the vaccine but nobody is caring about the health rules like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing.</p>
      <p>The government is broadcasting lessons on television for school students, while universities are conducting classes online. Rasheda Choudhury, executive director of Campaign for Popular Education, told Reuters:</p>
      <p>There are currently no statistics available on the dropout rate. But we fear the figure could be as much as 40%.</p>

      <p>French doctor to face charges over hydroxychloroquine claims</p>
      <p>A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - will appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches, an order of doctors said today.</p>
      <p>Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug.</p>
      <p>His promotion of hydroxychloroquine was taken up by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro respectively, who trumpeted its unproven benefits in a way, say critics, that put people's lives at risk.</p>
      <p>No clinical trials have yet found in favour of using hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19. Critics say that due to potential serious side effects, treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine is worse than no treatment at all.</p>
      <p>In June, the British-led Recovery trial team said that hydroxychloroquine does nothing to reduce coronavirus mortality.</p>
      <p>A group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF) filed a complaint with the national Order of Doctors of the Bouche-du-Rhone department, which includes Marseille, in July.</p>
      <p>They accused Raoult of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Other doctors and patients have also lodged complaints.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the group of doctors confirmed it had given the go-ahead for a disciplinary hearing after reviewing the complaints against Raoult. A hearing will likely only take place next year.</p>
      <p>Raoult's lawyer, Fabrice Di Vizio, confirmed they had received notice of the decision, but insisted his client would be cleared. If found guilty, Raoult could be fined, warned, or barred from practicing.</p>
      <p>Raoult, who heads the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, said in March that his study of 80 patients showed "favourable" outcomes in four out of five treated with hydroxychloroquine.</p>
      <p>But his peers insist there is no scientific evidence to back up the claim.</p>
      <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited the scientist on 9 April at the height of the pandemic, when the French were observing strict stay-at-home rules.</p>

      <p>Up to 4 million primary and secondary school pupils were meant to return to classrooms, but the turnout nationwide was unclear.</p>
      <p>Unicef had said last month that only one in three countries in central and west Africa had reopened schools at the due date for the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>
      <p>Senegal, a poor nation with a population of about 16 million people, has so far been spared a large coronavirus outbreak.</p>
      <p>Health officials have registered 15,744 positive cases to date, with 326 fatalities. Only 31 people are currently being treated for the disease in the country.</p>
      <p>Senegal initially declared a state of emergency when the pandemic reached the country in March, closing schools, imposing a curfew and restricting international flights.</p>
      <p>The government has since eased or lifted most of the restrictions, with children returning to school the last major antivirus measure to come to an end. About half a million students who were sitting exams were also allowed to return to school late June.</p>
      <p>The education ministry spokesman, Mohamed Moustapha Diagne, told AFP a protocol is in place in schools involving compulsory face masks, hand-washing and social distancing.</p>
      <p>But there are concerns that many schools lack protective gear and hand sanitisers, despite government promises to provide them.</p>
      <p>"We still haven't received a supply of masks and hydro-alcoholic gel," said an official at a primary school in the Dakar suburb of Mbao, who requested anonymity.</p>
      <p>Most students at the school were not wearing a mask, witnessed an AFP journalist.</p>
      <p>Abdoulaye Ndoye, from a Senegalese teachers' union, also said that many rural schools had not received the promised supplies.</p>

      <p>Austria 's 24-hour tally of new coronavirus infections surpassed 9,000 for the first time today, with the government coming under growing pressure to introduce tougher measures to bring the outbreak under control. The government has previously said 6,000 new daily infections is the level at which hospitals will eventually be overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the country introduced a partial shutdown until the end of November to slow the spread of the virus. Restaurants, cafes and bars have closed to all but takeaway service while theatres and museums have shut. A nighttime curfew is in place from 8pm to 6am but infections continue to rise.</p>
      <p>A total of 9,262 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, data from the interior and health ministries showed. The tally was even higher than the 9,105 reported by newspapers Kronen Zeitung and Oesterreich earlier today. The previous record was 8,241, set on Saturday. The first wave of infections peaked at 1,050 a day in March.</p>
      <p>The Alpine republic's government has said it will assess the situation tomorrow, 13 days after it announced the curfew and partial shutdown, and might announce a further tightening of restrictions.</p>

      <p>A combination of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine from the Canadian drug developer Medicago and Britain's GSK will enter into large human studies involving more than 30,000 healthy adults, the two companies said today.</p>
      <p>The news comes days after the companies said the vaccine candidate produced virus-neutralising antibodies in all volunteers in an early-stage study.</p>

      <p>Fauci calls for solidarity and defends WHO</p>
      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious disease expert, told a Chatham House webinar that statewide and international cooperation was vital to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>Asked what he would do differently if he was in charge of the health response in the US, he said:</p>
      <p>Even though there's a lot of positive aspects and beauty to the system in the US, namely the independence of the different states, what I would like to see is a much more uniform approach across all the states, because we really are all in this together. When you have an infectious disease, it doesn't matter if you have a country with 50 different states, what happens in one part of the country is going to influence what is happening in another part of the country. Just like when something happens in one part of the world, when you have a respiratory transmittable disease, you can be darned sure it's going to happen in another part of the world. As we move forward, what I would like to see is that uniformity of response. Everyone pulling together, whether you're in the US, EU, UK, anywhere, everyone pulling together at the same time.</p>
      <p>On the legacy of Covid-19, he said:</p>
      <p>I would hope that the world realises what we keep saying whenever we get an outbreak, which is that we've got to develop corporate memory and lessons learned for preparation for the next one. There are so many current problems that people have, when you talk about preparing for something that hasn't happened yet, that's a difficult water to carry. I hope that the terrible ordeal that we've gone together globally will not soon be forgotten. When we talk about the kinds of global health security network, the kind of communication and transparency between nations, the mutual respect and interactions that we have [I hope] really get solidified. There isn't anything that we can do about the emergence of new microbes, but what we can do is to control what happens when they do emerge. We certainly can do better on how we handle an emergence.</p>
      <p>In contradiction to Donald Trump's opinions about the World Health Organization, he emphasised its importance:</p>
      <p>We need to make sure that the international health structures, the WHO, really get strengthened. It's not a perfect organisation, it has faults that have been pointed out by others, but I think the world does need a global organisation.</p>
      <p>He stressed that even once we have a vaccine, coronavirus is not going to disappear:</p>
      <p>I doubt we're going to eradicate this. I think we need to plan that this is something we need to maintain control over chronically. It maybe something that becomes endemic that we just have to be careful of. Certainly it's not going to be pandemic for much longer, because I believe the vaccine are going to turn that around.</p>
      <p>Fauci hinted that positive data from another vaccine was imminent and also that we should soon have a whole load of additional drugs at our disposal to prevent death/serious illness - monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drug combos - but there were no specifics.</p>

      <p>The Irish government is confident that it will be able to drop some of the strictest Covid-19 restrictions in Europe on schedule in December following a sharp fall in infection rates, the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said today.</p>
      <p>"I think everyone is confident now that we will ease restrictions in December," Varadkar told parliament.</p>
      <p>Rules which have closed all bars, restaurants and non-essential retail and banned non-essential travel more than 5km from home are due to lapse on 1 December, though ministers have said less strict restrictions are likely to remain.</p>
      <p>Updated at 2.01pm GMT</p>
      <p>1.37pm GMT</p>
      <p>The final question put to Dr Anthony Fauci was about the ability of the virus to mutate and whether it would affect a vaccine/therapy. He said he believed the extent to which it could mutate to be limited, so it should not be a problem for the vaccine. He said it was more likely to have an impact on therapy.</p>
      <p>1.24pm GMT</p>
      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci is asked about reinfection. He says it can occur and the durability of immunity is a critical question: "It is definitely finite."</p>
      <p>We may need to revaccinate intermittently, he says, but at the moment we cannot say what the intervening period would be.</p>
      <p>Asked about the speed at which the Pfizer vaccine has progressed, Fauci says it is due to "extraordinary science advances". It is speed based on "technical advances", not rashness, he says. Fauci adds that doing the trial in the middle of a fierce outbreak made it easier to test it.</p>
      <p>1.12pm GMT</p>
      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, speaking virtually at the British thinktank Chatham House, says there has been unprecedented "polarisation" with respect to public health and science in the current pandemic. He says: "I do hope we can turn that around and I think we can."</p>
      <p>Prof David Heymann says the rejection of science seems particularly high in the United States. He says it has become highly politicised such that a mask wearer is seen as a Democrat and a non-mask wearer as a Republican.</p>
      <p>Fauci makes clear that there should be wide access to the vaccine, whether you live or die should not depend on where in the world you are.</p>

      <p>12.59pm GMT</p>
      <p>Dr Anthony Fauci said what was needed in the United States was "more uniform implementation of public health measures", such as social distancing and masks.</p>
      <p>The top US public health expert said the news about the Pfizer vaccine trials should be encouraging to people. He said:</p>
      <p>Please don't give up, the end is in sight.</p>
      <p>He questioned why when the US tried to reopen the country it was done in a "disparate way". He said there needed to be a uniform response "because we are all in this together".</p>
      <p>David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said it was disappointing to see how the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) had been "marginalised".</p>

      <p>Pope Francis is offering free coronavirus tests for Rome's poor and homeless as part of the Roman Catholic church's World Day of the Poor activities, the Vatican said today.</p>
      <p>The swabs are being offered at a clinic near St Peter's Square which the pope set up several years ago to provide basic medical care to destitute people, some of whom live on the streets in the neighbourhood around the Vatican.</p>
      <p>Italy surpassed the 1m infections mark yesterday, leapfrogging Mexico to become one of the top 10 worst-affected countries globally, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
      <p>Archbishop Rino Fisichella told reporters that up to 50 coronavirus tests a day were being done and the initiative would continue indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Those who test negative receive a certificate to enter a shelter and those who test positive are directed to further treatment.</p>
      <p>Many of Italy's homeless are foreigners who do not have a family doctor with the national health system and Italians who become homeless, because of economic difficulties, are often too embarrassed to return to their family doctors.</p>

      <p>Germany: tentative signs infections may be easing</p>
      <p>Germany is seeing tentative signs that a surge in coronavirus infections may be easing, officials said today, crediting anti-transmission measures they warned would have to be maintained through winter and beyond.</p>
      <p>"The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).</p>
      <p>Falling daily new infection figures show "we are not helpless against this virus" and that restrictions such as social distancing and mask wearing can help halt the march of Covid-19, he added.</p>
      <p>Germany reported 21,866 new cases of Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, according to RKI data.</p>
      <p>The key reproduction figure (r) has fallen below 1 to 0.89, meaning that 100 people are passing on the virus to 89 others - a sign that transmission is slowing.</p>
      <p>Despite the encouraging data, the RKI chief said the situation could worsen in coming weeks in hospitals, which may "reach their limits".</p>
      <p>"We must prevent the situation from deteriorating," he said, stressing Germany's aim is to bring infection numbers down to a level that the healthcare system can cope with.</p>
      <p>Wieler urged Germans to keep social contacts to a minimum, saying the so-called AHA-L measures would still be necessary even if a vaccine is available because it will take time to roll out the jabs.</p>
      <p>Under Germany's AHA-L rule mantra, individuals are urged to maintain distances of at least 1.5 metres (5ft), wash their hands regularly, wear masks in indoor or crowded outdoor places as well as airing out rooms.</p>
      <p>'A long time'</p>
      <p>Germany reimposed tough curbs this month to help slow the outbreak, with leisure and cultural centres closing and restaurants and bars only allowed to offer takeaway.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a new round of talks with regional leaders of Germany's 16 states on Monday to take stock of the situation and examine if the restrictions should be maintained or toughened.</p>
      <p>Taking questions during a citizens' dialogue, Merkel told a Bavarian hotel manager that if people behaved "reasonably... we might have a chance" of slowly reopening in December.</p>
      <p>But the veteran leader has also begun managing Germans' expectations for Christmas, saying that she could foresee small family gatherings but no lavish parties.</p>
      <p>The health minister, Jens Spahn, said it was clear that the Christmas festive season would be accompanied by restrictions. The virus "takes a long time to brake", he told regional radio RBB.</p>
      <p>"Even if we managed to bring the numbers down now, it doesn't mean that people can just get going everywhere again in December or January.</p>
      <p>"Partying over Christmas like nothing is going on won't work," he warned.</p>
      <p>For the health minister, parties with more than 10 people this winter are not on if Germany wants to keep the pandemic under control.</p>
      <p>With an eye on rising infections in schools, several German states have mooted the idea of lengthening the Christmas vacation to keep the population home and break the chain of transmission.</p>
      <p>Merkel has warned that only when 60 to 70% of the population has achieved immunity can Covid-19 be deemed to have been "more or less overcome".</p>

      <p>Russia is another country to report record high number of coronavirus deaths today, with authorities in Moscow warning they could consider imposing additional restrictions if the situation worsened.</p>
      <p>There were 439 deaths linked to the virus reported in Russia today.</p>
      <p>Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said he did not expect the surge in cases in the capital, which reported nearly 6,000 new infections today, to subside any time soon. He said about 12,000 coronavirus patients were currently hospitalised.</p>
      <p>The sprawling city of nearly 13 million people has already ordered bars, restaurants and nightclubs to close at 11pm, and moved university and college students to online learning.</p>
      <p>"I hope that more restrictions will not be needed, but that will depend on the situation," Sobyanin said in an interview with state television.</p>
      <p>Nationwide, Russian authorities reported 21,608 new infections over the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Wary of crippling the economy and destroying jobs, they have said they will not reimpose a full lockdown like that seen earlier this year, stressing the importance of hygiene, social distancing and targeted measures in certain regions instead.</p>
      <p>With 1,858,568 infections since the start of the pandemic, Russia has the world's fifth largest number of cases after the United States, India, Brazil and France. Russia has reported 32,032 deaths to date from Covid-19.</p>

      <p>Croatia today reported 3,082 new cases of Covid-19, the highest daily number since the global pandemic hit the country nine months ago, although the prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, said the overall rate of increase was slowing.</p>
      <p>The south-east European nation of 4 million people has registered a total of 75,922 cases of the respiratory disease with 925 fatalities to day. There are now 16,388 active cases.</p>
      <p>Plenkovic appealed to citizens to respect protective measures. He said:</p>
      <p>We are in the toughest period of the epidemic, but a good thing we see is that a rise in the number of newly infected is slowing down [over the course of the past week].</p>
      <p>Croats are obliged to wear face masks in indoor public spaces and on public transport, while employees are urged to organise work from home wherever possible. But the conservative government has said it will try to avoid a blanket lockdown or a curfew to avoid crippling the economy</p>

      <p>Dozens of hospital workers have held protests at hospitals in Greece, demanding more medical staff be hired as the country struggles to contain a resurgence of the coronavirus that has led to a new lockdown being imposed.</p>
      <p>The country's health system has come under increasing pressure due to an increase in the number of people seriously ill with Covid-19. As of last night, Greece had a total of 1,104 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 496 were set aside for Covid-19 patients. Of those, 335 are occupied.</p>
      <p>The government has stressed it has massively increased the country's intensive care capacity, noting there were a total of just over 500 ICU beds in Greece when it came to power after elections in mid-2019.</p>
      <p>In a speech this morning on the government's handling of the pandemic, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said:</p>
      <p>Every humanly possible effort was made so that we can, in the intervening time between the first wave and where we are today, reinforce the ICUs with beds and personnel. Whatever was humanly possible to be done has been done and continues to be done.</p>
      <p>Mitsotakis said that no matter how many ICUs a country has, "and obviously we prefer to have more rather than fewer, a health system cannot cope if we do not hit the problem at the start of the chain. The start of the chain is the uncontrolled spread of the virus mainly through crowding and contact with people we do not know."</p>
      <p>The prime minister said the resurgence of the virus in Greece and the rest of Europe was due to "young people having fun. I'm not saying this as criticism, of course young people are more susceptible to such behaviour. But it's an observation and it needs to be heard."</p>
      <p>In the initial outbreak of the pandemic in the spring, Greece imposed an early lockdown, a move that was credited with keeping the number of deaths and seriously ill very low. But a resurgence of the virus this autumn has led to a rapidly increasing number of people in ICUs, and a sharp increase in deaths.</p>
      <p>As of last night, Greece's total confirmed coronavirus cases stood at just over 63,300 with 909 deaths in the country of about 11 million people.</p>

      <p>Firstly, the Football Association has said it has asked the government to consider allowing England to play their Nations League match against Iceland at Wembley "by giving travel exemption to the Icelandic team subject to strict medical protocols".</p>
      <p>Secondly, France 24 is reporting that fans may be asked not to cheer at the Tokyo Olympics to avoid the risk of spreading the coronavirus, a top official said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The comments follow a gymnastics test event in Tokyo on Sunday where mask-wearing spectators, urged not to shout or cheer, confined themselves to polite applause and murmurs of approval.</p>
      <p>Tokyo 2020's chief executive, Toshiro Muto, said fans arriving in Japan may be spared a mandatory two-week quarantine, saying it would be too hard to enforce. But he said officials were also considering urging fans not to shout or talk loudly, to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infections at the postponed 2020 games.</p>
      <p>"There's a possibility that we might ask the (Olympic) spectators to refrain from shouting or talking in a loud voice," said Muto after a committee meeting.</p>
      <p>"When we think of the impact, we believe it is an item for consideration, to reduce the risk of airborne droplets."</p>
      <p>However, Muto added that the "practicality and feasibility" of clamping down on cheering needed to be considered.</p>
      <p>While sports competitions around the world have resumed after shutting down for the pandemic, most are taking place behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Fans are allowed at sports events in Japan, usually in limited numbers, but they are advised not to shout and cheer.</p>

      <p>President-elect Joe Biden has chosen his longtime adviser Ron Klain to reprise his role as chief of staff, thereby installing an aide with decades of experience in the top role in his White House, AP reports.</p>
      <p>Klain will lead a White House likely to be consumed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to spread across the nation, and will face the challenge of working with a divided Congress that could include a Republican-led Senate. Klain served as the coordinator to the Ebola response during the 2014 outbreak.</p>
      <p>Klain served as chief of staff for Biden during Barack Obama's first term, was chief of staff to Vice-president Al Gore in the mid-1990s and was a key adviser on the Biden campaign, guiding Biden's debate preparations and coronavirus response. He has known and worked with Biden since the Democrat's 1987 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>The choice of Klain underscores the effort the incoming Biden administration will place on the coronavirus response from day one. Klain also played a central role in drafting and implementing the Obama administration's economic recovery plan in 2009.</p>

      <p>California is nearing the unwelcome milestone of a million Covid-19 cases, reports AP.</p>
      <p>For months, the virus has hammered the economy, disproportionately affected the poor, and upended daily life - and now the state and the rest of the country are trying to curb another surge of infections.</p>
      <p>California will be the second state - behind Texas - to eclipse a million known cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million people comes as the US has surpassed 10m infections. Eleven counties this week have had to reimpose limits.</p>
      <p>The timeline of Covid-19 in the US often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The death of a San Jose woman on 6 February is the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community.</p>
      <p>Health officials have warned against get-togethers as the holidays approach and people spend more time indoors, where the virus spreads more easily.</p>

      <p>Global oil demand is unlikely to get a significant boost from the roll-out of vaccines against Covid-19 until well into 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday, a view that is likely to dampen oil price gains since vaccine progress was announced earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"It is far too early to know how and when vaccines will allow normal life to resume. For now, our forecasts do not anticipate a significant impact in the first half of 2021," the IEA said in its monthly report, reported by Reuters.</p>

      <p>The Gates Foundation added another $70m of funding on Thursday to global efforts to develop and distribute vaccines and treatments against the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it hoped other international donors would also pledge more.</p>
      <p>An extra $50m will go to the Covax Advance Market Commitment (AMC) led by the Gavi vaccine alliance, the foundation said, and another $20m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) which is co-funding development of several Covid-19 vaccine candidates, reports Reuters.</p>
      <p>"We have to ensure that everyone gets equal access to tests, drugs, and vaccines when they are available - no matter where you live in the world," the foundation's co-chair, Melinda Gates, said in a statement.

      <p>Israeli 's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he is working "around the clock" to make a deal with the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, following promising preliminary results from its Covid-19 vaccine trial.</p>
      <p>Fearing Israel could be left without an early vaccine, the country's leader said he had held two phone calls with Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla - one at 2am local time on Thursday - in the hopes of signing an agreement.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu said in a statement that the call was "very warm and cordial" but did not announce an agreement had been signed. "The whole world wants to get [Pfizer's] medicines. We are negotiating with them," he said.</p>
      <p>Interim results from Pfizer this week suggested that its two-shot vaccine, developed with the German firm BioNTech, was 90% effective.</p>
      <p>Local media in Israel, a country of 9 million people, reported the prime minister was looking to source about 6m doses. Pfizer has not commented on any deal.</p>
      <p>Israel has deals in place with at least two other pharmaceutical firms for vaccines and is developing its own, but officials do not expect to start vaccination drives with those unreleased products for several months.</p>

      <p>AP is looking at whether it is safe to fly during the pandemic. From 1 December, reports the news agency, Southwest Airlines will join United and American in allowing every seat on planes to be sold. JetBlue will scale back the number of blocked seats, and - along with Delta and Alaska - plans to drop all limits some time next year.</p>
      <p>The airline industry says it is safe to fly, pointing to a report it funded that found the risk of viral spread on planes very low if everyone wears a mask as planes have good ventilation and strong air filters.</p>
      <p>But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that sitting within 6ft of other passengers - sometimes for hours - can still increase your risk of infection. And although airlines are still requiring passengers to wear masks, there is no guarantee everyone will comply. More than 1,000 people who refused to wear masks have been banned by US airlines.</p>
      <p>Remember, says AP, that flying also means spending time in airport security lines and gate areas, where you might come into close contact with others.</p>
      <p>In an October travel update, the CDC emphasised the importance of wearing a mask and recommended checking whether infections are rising in the area to which you're travelling.</p>

      <p>India has so far reported about 8.6m coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711.</p>
      <p>Still, the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research says the recent fall in cases nationally could be undone if there is a resurgence in infections around Diwali.</p>

      <p>Italy is experiencing a virus surge with hospitals facing breaking point, according to a report by AP.</p>
      <p>The Italian doctors federation called this week for a nationwide lockdown to forestall a collapse of the medical system, marked by the closure of non-emergency procedures. The government is facing tougher criticism than in the spring, when the health crisis was met with an outpouring of solidarity.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday, 52% of Italy's hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients, above the 40% warning threshold set by the Health Ministry.</p>
      <p>Nine of Italy's 21 regions and autonomous provinces are already securely in the red-alert zone, above 50% virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75%, Piedmont at 92% and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99%. Lombardy, Italy's most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy's pandemic.</p>
      <p>The region's hospitals are responding by reorganising wards in a bid to avoid shutting down ordinary care, as happened spontaneously during Italy's first deadly coronavirus spike.</p>
      <p>But nonetheless, hospitals in Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont - designated red zones by the government last week - have closed surgical, paediatric and geriatric wards to make room for COVID patients. Veneto, still a lowest-tier yellow zone, is preparing to cancel all non-urgent procedures this week.</p>

      <p>Turkey has banned smoking in public places across the country to curb the spread of Covid-19, AP is reporting.</p>
      <p>The interior ministry said smoking would be banned in busy streets, bus stops and public squares when necessary. It said the nationwide mask mandate in public spaces, which has been in effect for several months, must be followed at all times and smokers were routinely violating the mask rule.</p>
      <p>The ministry also said provinces can decide to impose curfews on senior citizens above the age of 65 if they are seeing increases in the number of critical patients. The governors of Istanbul and Ankara have already reintroduced measures this week, allowing senior citizens to leave their homes only between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>Turkey has seen a spike in infections since lifting partial lockdowns and reopening businesses in late May. The latest Health Ministry figures show 86 new fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 11,145.</p>

      <p>Athletes arriving at Tokyo Olympic Games will be exempt from isolation requirements</p>
      <p>Athletes arriving in Tokyo for next year's Olympic Games, postponed from 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be exempt from the 14-day isolation period Japan has imposed on anyone arriving from overseas to help stop the virus spreading. Olympic organisers said on Thursday details still need to be worked out, but measures for athletes are likely to include coronavirus testing within 72 hours before arriving in Japan. But they warned decisions on spectators from overseas have yet to be made, saying a 14-day quarantine was "impossible". "Athletes, coaches and Games officials that are eligible for the Tokyo Games will be allowed to enter the country, provided significant measures are made before they get to Japan," Tokyo 2020 Chief Executive Officer Toshiro Muto told a news conference.</p>

      <p>Muto was speaking after a meeting between officials from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the national government and Tokyo 2020 organisers on infection prevention procedures during the Games. He said a decision on foreign spectators would be made next year, depending on pandemic developments. "By next spring, we will be coming up with a plan for spectators, including non-Japanese spectators," he said. "It is impossible to set a 14-day quarantine period for foreign spectators, so tests before and upon arrival are needed." Japan has held several recent test events, including a four-nation gymnastics meet last weekend, in which spectators have been admitted, but these were limited to residents of Japan. International Olympic Committee head Thomas Bach is due in Japan for a three-day visit next week, at which Muto said he expected details of coronavirus counter-measures would be ironed out.</p>

      <p>California nears 1m confirmed infections</p>
      <p>California looks set to be the second state - behind Texas - to eclipse a million known coronavirus cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million comes as the US has surpassed 10 million infections.</p>
      <p>The state currently has 989,400 cases confirmed. The timeline of Covid-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The Feb. 6 death of a San Jose woman is the first known coronavirus fatality in the U.S. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community. On 19 March, Governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding. The spread slowed, but California faced the same challenges as other states: providing enough protective gear for health workers, doing enough testing and providing timely results, tracking infections and those potentially exposed.</p>

      <p>As the state tried to balance public health and the economy, cases rose as it relaxed business restrictions. Eleven counties this week had to reimpose limits. The virus has struck poor Californians and Latinos especially hard. Latinos make up 39% of the population but account for more than 60% of infections. In working-class neighborhoods near downtown Los Angeles, one in five people tested positive at community clinics during the pandemic's early days, said Jim Mangia, president and chief executive of St. John's Well Child and Family Center. Many caught the virus in essential low-wage jobs or on public transit and brought it back to crowded homes.</p>

      <p>The United States continued to notch up grim records on Wednesday as it battles through the coronavirus pandemic, with a worsening outbreak in the northeast of the country adding pressure on top of an already reeling Midwest, Reuters reports. New Covid-19 infections of 142,279 were at an all-time daily high for a second day in a row and above 100,000 for an eighth consecutive day, according to a Reuters tally. The number of people hospitalised with the virus also surged, to at least 64,939 by late Wednesday, the highest ever during the pandemic. The death toll rose by 1,464. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was the latest state official to impose a new round of social distancing restrictions on Wednesday, in an attempt to protect a state that was the epicentre of the US outbreak in its early stages. The US has reported a total of about 10.4 million cases and 241,809 deaths throughout the pandemic.</p>

The student, a young woman, began displaying symptoms on Monday and continued going to work at her customer-facing job in the central city, despite being tested for Covid-19 and being told to stay home. The woman's manager told her to come to work, and wear a mask instead - ignoring health advice. The woman lived alone in a large block of apartments, and all residents there are being asked to stay home until they have all been tested. The woman also took a number of uber's to her job in the central city, and frequently bought food and takeaways from the CBD while she was symptomatic.

Cemeteries decorated with American flags were silent as well, as many of the traditional ceremonies were canceled. With infections raging again nationwide, several veterans homes are fighting new outbreaks. In New York City, a quiet parade of military vehicles, with no spectators, rolled through Manhattan to maintain the 101-year tradition of veterans marching on Fifth Avenue. President Donald Trump took part in an observance at Arlington National Cemetery, while President-elect Joe Biden placed a wreath at the Korean War Memorial in Philadelphia.</p>

      <p>More than 4,200 veterans have died from Covid-19 at hospitals and homes run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and nearly 85,000 have been infected, according to the department. That death toll does not include an untold number who have died in private or state-run veterans facilities, including the Holyoke Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts, which had nearly 80 deaths earlier this year. Two former administrators were charged with criminal offenses after an investigation found that "utterly baffling" decisions caused the disease to run rampant there. American veterans are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age and underlying health conditions, some of which can be traced to exposure to the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and smoke from burning oilfields in the Persian Gulf.</p>

      <p>Texas on Wednesday became the first state with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and California closed in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country. Reuters: Texas, the second-most populous state, has recorded 1.02 million coronavirus cases and over 19,000 deaths since the outbreak began in early March, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has recorded over 240,000 deaths and more than 10.3 million confirmed infections, with new cases soaring to all-time highs of well over 120,000 per day over the past week. Health experts have blamed the increase in part on the onset of cold weather and growing frustration with mask-wearing and other precautions.</p>
      <p>Texas reported 10,865 new cases on Tuesday, breaking a record set in mid-July. One of the hardest-hit places is the border city of El Paso; its county has nearly 28,000 active cases and has suffered more than 680 Covid-19 deaths.</p>

      <p>Stocks in Asia were set to continue their gains on Thursday, buoyed again by continued global stimulus efforts and hopes of a coronavirus vaccine, Reuters reports. Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 shares rose 0.29% in early trading, while Japan's Nikkei 225 futures fell 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures rose 0.56%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.01% higher. The gains in Asia came after a mixed performance for US stocks. The Nasdaq closed up 2% on Wednesday as investors switched back to technology stocks and away from economically sensitive sectors as they weighed Covid-19 vaccine progress and the likely timing of an economic rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.29 points, or 0.08%, to 29,397.63 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 27.13 points, or 0.77%, to 3,572.66.</p>

      <p>The momentum of vaccine hopes and encouraging comments from European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on continued economic support boosted European shares higher for the third straight session. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.08% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05%. The US dollar rose and the safe-haven yen weakened again on Wednesday as markets continued to adjust to higher interest rates and prospects for economic growth. The Australian dollar was flat versus the greenback at$0.728. The New Zealand dollar was also muted in early trading after it soared on Wednesday to its strongest in a year and a half as traders scaled back bets that the central bank there would move to negative interest rates.</p>

      <p>Brazil says Chinese vaccine trial can resume after suspension</p>
      <p>Brazil health regulator Anvisa on Wednesday allowed resumption of late-stage Brazilian clinical trials for China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, which had been suspended due to a study subject's death that was registered in Sao Paulo as a suicide, Reuters reports. Brazilian medical institute Butantan said in a statement it would restart trials later on Wednesday. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, a longtime China critic who has baselessly dismissed the Sinovac vaccine as lacking in credibility, had hailed Monday's suspension as a personal victory. Bolsonaro reiterated, however, on Wednesday evening that his government would purchase whatever vaccine is approved by Anvisa and the Health Ministry, which could ultimately include the Sinovac vaccine, if approved. The decision to suspend the trial - one of Sinovac's three large late-stage studies - was criticized by the trial organizers, who said the move had taken them by surprise and that there had been no need to stop the study as the death had no relation to the vaccine. The suspension further inflamed tensions between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who has pinned his political ambitions on the Chinese vaccine that he aims to roll out in his state as early as January, with or without federal assistance. Anvisa, in its statement on Wednesday, said the initial information it received about the case, which led to the suspension, had been incomplete and lacked the cause of the "severe adverse event." It has strongly dismissed suggestions the decision could have been politically motivated. "After evaluating the new data presented by the sponsor... Anvisa understands that it has sufficient reasons to allow the resumption of vaccination," the agency said. "It is important to clarify that a suspension does not necessarily mean that the product under investigation does not offer quality, safety or efficacy," Anvisa added. Sinovac, in a statement said: "We are confident in the safety of the vaccine, fully understand and appreciate Anvisa's strict supervision and timely resumption of the clinical studies."</p>

      <p>New Zealand identifies one new community case of coronavirus</p>
      <p>A new, mysterious case of Covid-19 has been recorded in New Zealand's largest city, and so far it has no links to the border or anyone that works there. The person, a university student, became symptomatic on Monday and continued going to their job in the CBD. Authorities believe they may have become infected the previous Saturday, but as yet they are not sure how, or where. Urgent genome testing is underway to see if the case has links to other domestic or international outbreaks, and the student has been placed in a quarantine hotel. The announcement caused concern for many Aucklanders, worried that they may face moving up an alert level. Another press conference on the case is scheduled for 5 pm, local time.</p>

      <p>Britain is "sleepwalking into a debt crisis" after a steep rise in emergency borrowing by low- and middle-income households to cope with the Covid-19 jobs crisis.</p>
      <p>Research by the debt charity Stepchange found that household borrowing and arrears linked to the coronavirus pandemic have soared 66% since May to £10.3bn. The number of people who are in severe debt has risen to 1.2 million - nearly doubling since March - with a further 3 million people at risk of falling into arrears after taking on extra short-term loans.</p>
      <p>Phil Andrew, the charity's chief executive, said: "This report paints a picture of a nation sleepwalking into a debt crisis. Despite a bold initial reaction to the pandemic, the government and financial services sector's toolkit of responses has not evolved, and the result is a spiralling number of people being plunged into debt due to Covid-19. And the worst is yet to come":</p>

      <p>China reports 15 new coronavirus cases</p>
      <p>Mainland China reported 15 new Covid-19 cases for 11 November, down from 17 cases a day earlier, the country's national health authority said on Thursday. The National Health Commission said in a statement that one of the new cases was a local infection in Tianjin. The remaining 14 cases were imported infections that originated from overseas, the commission said. The total number of new asymptomatic cases fell to six from 15 reported a day earlier. China does not count symptomless patients as confirmed Covid-19 cases. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China to date now stands at 86,299, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.</p>

      <p>Summary: New York reimposes restrictions as US sees world record 136,000 cases in one day</p>
      <p>Hello and welcome to today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>My name is Helen Sullivan, you can get in touch with me here, and I'll be bringing you the latest for the next while.</p>
      <p>As the US confirmed its highest 24 hours total to date - with a world record of 136,000 cases confirmed in one day, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced new curbs on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across New York state, and people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people.</p>
      <p>Cuomo says the new restrictions going into effect Friday are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. Cuomo spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise in New York and elsewhere. He said that 1,628 people were hospitalised across the state for Covid-19 on Tuesday and that 21 people had died. The new closing time applies to all establishments that are licensed by the State Liquor Authority. Only carry-out service will be allowed after that.</p>
      <p>Here are the other key developments from the last few hours:</p>
      <p>Cyprus has announced partial lockdowns in the towns of Limassol and Paphos to curb a surge in Covid-19 cases. The local measures, which include a ban on travel into and out of the towns and a nightly curfew, will take effect from Thursday and last until the end of November.</p>
      <p>Texas became the first US state with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases. California is also closing in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country from coast to coast.</p>
      <p>Sweden's PM, Stefan Lofven, said his government plans to ban nationwide the sale of alcohol after 10pm in bars, restaurants and night clubs from 20 November in an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19. Sweden has witnessed record numbers of new coronavirus infections in past weeks, which is burdening the country's health care system and intensive care wards.</p>
      <p>Spain'scoronavirus death toll surged to over 40,000 with infections passing the 1.4 million mark, while the rate of new cases continued to grow, health ministry data showed. A further 349 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 40,105 in Spain - the fourth-highest within the European Union after the United Kingdom, France and Italy.</p>
      <p>Despite having the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the continent, South Africa will open up travel to all countries and restore normal trading hours of alcohol in an effort to boost the tourism and hospitality sectors, the president Cyril Ramaphosa said.</p>
      <p>Officials and doctors in Pakistan urged people to stay at home as the air quality in Lahore deteriorated to hazardous levels, putting an additional burden on the fragile healthcare system amid a surge in coronavirus deaths and new infections.</p>
      <p>The New York governor Andrew Cuomo imposed a new round of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the infection rate climbed and hospitalisations soared in the state. Taking effect on Friday, Cuomo ordered bars, restaurants and gyms in the state to shut down on-premises services at 10pm nightly, and capped the number of people who could attend private parties at 10.</p>
      <p>Turkey banned smoking in crowded public places to slow a recent surge in symptomatic patients with coronavirus, as the government warned citizens to abide by protective measures. It comes as daily cases surged to 2,693 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Greek authorities announced stricter restrictions on movement, extending a curfew nationwide after infections broke fresh records, reporting 2,752 new cases on Wednesday. Four days after the country went into a second lockdown to curb the surge in cases, the government said all circulation would be banned between 9pm and 5am.</p>
      <p>Spain will demand a negative Covid-19 test for all travellers arriving from countries with a high risk for coronavirus from 23 November. Visitors will need to show evidence of a negative PCR test result within the previous 72 hours to be granted entry and officials will be allowed to ask for proof of the test results.</p>
      <p>The total number of coronavirus cases registered in Italy since the start of the pandemic surpassed the one million mark, the health ministry said.</p>
      <p>Slovakia's government will extend its state of emergency powers for the rest of the year to battle a surge in coronavirus cases.</p>

The UK government said a further 563 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, bringing the official tally to 50,928. However, separate figures from the UK's statistics agencies, which take into account all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, put the death toll at almost 67,000. The Chicago mayor, Lori Lightfoot, issued a 30-day advisory telling residents to stay at home and not to have visitors in the home, including for Thanksgiving. If residents travel out of the state, they must quarantine for 14 days or submit a negative virus test, she said. Northern Ireland's power-sharing government has agreed to extend Covid-19 restrictions for between one and two weeks, falling short of stricter measures demanded by Irish nationalist parties. The five-party power-sharing executive agreed the reopening of cafes and close-contact services such as hairdressers will be delayed by a week and the reopening of bars and restaurants serving alcohol will be delayed by two weeks. Italy recorded 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours - its highest daily figure since 6 April. The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with Wednesday - up from 32,961 to 37,978. The northern region of Lombardy remains the hardest-hit area. France's lockdown is to last for at least two more weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave, the prime minister, Jean Castex, told a news conference. He said that if the current slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week but that if the spread of infections began to accelerate he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures. Iran's death toll from the coronavirus has risen above 40,000 after 457 more fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The number of people who have died from Covid in Iran, which has the highest death count in the Middle East, now stands at 40,121. A senior health department official in Delhi has said that Diwali, starting on 14 November, could be "a super spreader event". India has so far reported about 8.6 million coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711. A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - is to appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches. Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug, which has been trumpeted by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro. Russia, Croatia, Greece were among countries to report respective daily records in the number of infections. Germany is seeing tentative signs that a surge in coronavirus infections may be easing, officials said today. "The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). He said it showed anti-transmission measures were working but warned there was still scope for the situation to deteriorate in coming weeks. Refusing to allow coronavirus to steal his Christmas, one Bavarian innkeeper has opened a drive-through Christmas market, complete with artificial snow that falls as you come in, Reuters reports. Some 2,500 Christmas markets are usually held in Germany in the lead-up to the holiday, drawing millions of visitors who sip mulled wine and buy trinkets among wooden huts. But most markets are likely to be cancelled this year due to the pandemic, including Nuremberg's world-famous "Christkindlesmarkt." Five months after Patrick Schmidt condensed the Bavarian "Dult" folk festival experience into a drive-through delight during the first wave of the pandemic, he is now trying to recreate the Christmas market feeling while sticking to guidelines for social distancing. "It was a spontaneous idea because of the second lockdown. I thought the Dult drive-in also worked so why not a Christmas market drive-in?" he beamed at the market's opening on Thursday in Landshut, some 60km (37 mile) northeast of Munich. "We don't just sell a crepe or a pack of roasted almonds, we sell an experience." Patrons said the market comes as a welcome boost as the country grinds through a month-long "lockdown light" under which bars, restaurants, theatres and museums have been closed. "I heard Christmas carols for the first time and I'm slowly getting into the mood," said Anton Kolbinger, holding cotton candy. "But to get into a real Christmas mood will still take some time." Schmidt said he already knows what he wants for Christmas: My biggest Christmas wish is that the coronavirus is finally brought under control and that next year is half-way normal again. That's what I hope for. People from Black and Asian backgrounds are at substantially greater risk of contracting Covid-19 than white people, according to a study that highlights the disproportionate impact of the disease on different groups in society. Black people are twice as likely to become infected with coronavirus as white people, and people from Asian backgrounds are one and a half times as likely, researchers found after analysing 50 studies that reported on the medical records of nearly 19 million Covid patients. The analysis, published in the journal EClinicalMedicine by the Lancet, is the first comprehensive, systematic review of published research and preliminary papers that delve into the burden of coronavirus on different ethnic groups. About half of the papers have appeared in peer-reviewed journals and the rest are preliminary findings. Beyond the raised risk of infection, the review suggests people from Asian backgrounds are more likely to be admitted to intensive care and may have a greater risk of death with coronavirus than white people. But the researchers cautioned that none of the studies on intensive care admissions had been peer-reviewed and that the increased risk of death was only borderline statistically significant. The Guardian's science editor, Ian Sample, has the story: Nearly 67,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have now occurred in the UK, the latest figures from the UK's statistics agencies show. These are separate from the figures gathered by the UK government, which only take into account deaths from Covid-19 where a person has died within 28 days of a positive test (see 8.05pm.). According to the most recent reports from the Office for National Statistics, the National Records of Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, a total of 63,317 deaths have so far been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. But since those figures were compiled, a further 3,195 deaths are known to have occurred in England, plus 33 in Scotland, 220 in Wales and 110 in Northern Ireland, according to additional data published on the UK government's coronavirus dashboard. Together, these totals mean that so far there have been 66,875 deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK. Father Christmas wears a mask and can travel the world thanks to a special permit, Italy's prime minister said on Thursday, in a bid to ease children's fears that Santa may also be under lockdown this year. Giuseppe Conte wrote on Facebook: Father Christmas assured me that he already has an international travel certificate: he can travel everywhere and distribute gifts to all the world's children. He was responding to a desperate letter by five-year-old Tommaso who had pleaded with him not to confine Babbo Natale, as Santa is known in Italy. Conte said: He confirmed to me that he always uses a mask and maintains a correct distance to protect himself and everyone he meets. He then suggested to the boy that he put a bottle of hand sanitising gel under the tree, along with warm milk and biscuits. The Italian PM continued: I'm letting you know that it won't be necessary to tell Father Christmas that you were good in your letter, because I already told him. I also found out that you wanted to ask Father Christmas to chase away the coronavirus. Don't forget to ask for another present. Italy, the first European country hit by coronavirus earlier this year, has recorded a surge in cases in recent weeks and has topped one million infections in total. Several types of restrictions have been imposed nationwide and at a local level, depending on the health situation in different regions. But a growing number of medical workers and politicians are calling for stricter measures, and even a second nationwide lockdown. Whatever the evolution of the pandemic in the coming weeks, the regional affairs minister Francesco Boccia said on Thursday that Christmas would only be celebrated among close family members. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the nation in two videos on Thursday, his first appearance since being hospitalised after testing positive for Covid-19 this week. Sitting in a chair in front of a Ukrainian flag, Zelenskiy said he felt good and the government was working as normal. He also spoke about his administration's standoff with the Constitutional Court over anti-corruption reforms. The president, 42, was moved to hospital to self-isolate and not put others at risk, his office said. Three other top officials, including the finance minister, the defence minister and Zelenskiy's top aide were also reported to be infected. "As you know, Covid-19 has not avoided me, but I feel good," Zelenskiy said. Ukrainian new coronavirus infections began rising in late September and have remained consistently high in October and November, prompting the government to extend some restrictions until the end of the year. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy's cabinet voted to impose a national lockdown at weekends to strengthen steps to curb the rapid spread of infection. Ukraine has registered a total of 500,865 coronavirus cases and 9,145 deaths as of Thursday. Portugal has announced an expansion of a nightly curfew and weekend lockdown already in place across more than 100 municipalities to a further 77 areas as it scrambles to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. "The situation is serious and more critical than what we experienced in the first wave of the pandemic," the prime minister Antonio Costa told a news conference. Residents of affected areas are asked to not leave the house except for work, school or shopping during the week, and must stay home between 11pm and 5am. At weekends, a lockdown is in place from 1pm to 5am, during which all commercial outlets and restaurants must shut, although there are exceptions for bakeries, pharmacies and neighbourhood grocery shops. Restaurants will be able to apply for compensation of 20% of their average revenues to make up for income lost over the next two weekends, Costa announced, after workers in areas where the weekend lockdown was already in place protested that it was killing the sector. AHRESP, an association representing the hotel and restaurant sector, said 49,000 businesses had been wiped out between July and September. Any municipality with more than 240 new cases per 100,000 people in the space of two weeks must follow the new rules. Seven were removed in the past week as their infection rate fell below the threshold. A nationwide state of emergency that came into force on Monday and is due to last until 23 November could also be extended if necessary. Portugal, with just over 10 million people, has recorded a comparatively low 191,011 cases and 3,181 deaths. However, last Saturday the number of daily infections hit 6,640, the highest figure since the pandemic started, albeit with an expanded testing programme. Costa said: The least we owe healthcare professionals is to make an additional effort. The rule is simple: We have to stay at home. The UK government said a further 563 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday. That brings the official tally to 50,928. Though lower than the 595 deaths reported on Wednesday - the highest daily figure recorded since early May - it is still well above 500 and the seven-day average for deaths is running at 375, compared to 295 a week ago. Taking into account all deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the UK's death toll is actually now almost 67,000. It comes as the UK recorded 33,470 further coronavirus cases - a new daily record, and more than 10,000 greater than the total for Wednesday. The figure is also more than 6,000 above the previous highest daily total. The seven-day average for new cases is now running at 22,524, compared to 22,398 a week ago. The government's coronavirus dashboard is here. The Chicago mayor, Lori Lightfoot, said on Thursday that the third largest city in the US could have 1,000 more Covid-19 deaths by the end of 2020 if residents did not change behaviours and do more to stop the spread of the virus. Lightfoot issued a 30-day advisory that will begin on Monday, calling upon residents to stay at home and not to have visitors, even for Thanksgiving. If residents travel out of the state, they must quarantine for 14 days or submit a negative virus test, she said during a news conference. Northern Ireland's power-sharing government has agreed to extend Covid-19 restrictions for between one and two weeks, falling short of stricter measures demanded by Irish nationalist parties, Reuters reports. In mid-October, Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to reimpose strict Covid-19 constraints, closing schools for two weeks and bars and restaurants for four, but the measures were due to lapse on Friday. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been pushing for a swift end to the restrictions to help small-business owners, but the rival Ulster Unionists and Irish nationalist parties Sinn Féin and the SDLP said high infection rates meant restrictions should be maintained. Under a compromise between the DUP, the UUP and the non-sectarian Alliance party, the five-party power-sharing executive agreed the reopening of cafes and close-contact services such as hairdressers will be delayed by a week and the reopening of bars and restaurants serving alcohol will be delayed by two weeks. Sinn Féin voted against the measures, while the SDLP abstained. "The advice was that we needed a further two-week restriction [on cafes and close-contact services] and that's what we would have wanted to see," Sinn Fein's Northern Ireland leader, Michelle O'Neill, told UTV television. Northern Ireland has reported 825 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, including 15 reported on Thursday. It has had just over 200 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, around three times the rate in the Republic of Ireland, which has fallen sharply since strict measures were introduced. Good evening from London. I'm Lucy Campbell, I'll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. As always, please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share. Your thoughts are always welcome! Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ I'm handing over the blog to my colleague Lucy Campbell now. I'll leave you with a summary of the latest developments: Italy recorded 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours - its highest daily figure since 6 April. The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with Wednesday - up from 32,961 to 37,978. The northern region of Lombardy remains the hardest-hit area. France's lockdown is to last for at least two more weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave, the prime minister, Jean Castex, told a news conference. He said that if the current slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week but that if the spread of infections began to accelerate he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures. Iran's death toll from the coronavirus has risen above 40,000 after 457 more fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The number of people who have died from Covid in Iran, which has the highest death count in the Middle East, now stands at 40,121. A senior health department official in Delhi has said that Diwali, starting on 14 November, could be "a super spreader event". India has so far reported about 8.6 million coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711. A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - is to appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches. Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug, which has been trumpeted by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro. Russia, Croatia, Greece were among countries to report respective daily records in the number of infections.

"The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). He said it showed anti-transmission measures were working but warned there was still scope for the situation to deteriorate in coming weeks. Greece reported 3,316 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, its highest daily tally since its first infection surfaced in February, according to health authorities data. The latest jump in infections brings the total number of cases in the country to 66,637. It also registered 50 deaths, bringing the number of victims since the onset of the virus to 959. A resurgence in cases since early October has forced Greece to reimpose a nationwide lockdown until the end of the month. Donald Trump's adviser Corey Lewandowski has become the latest member of the outgoing president's staff to test positive for coronavirus. Lewandowski recently traveled to Pennsylvania to assist Trump's efforts to contest the state's election results. He said today he believes he was infected in Philadelphia and is not experiencing any symptoms. Lewandowski appeared with Rudy Giuliani at an event on Saturday outside a landscaping company and lobbed unfounded accusations of voter fraud as the race was called for Trump's challenger, now-President-elect Joe Biden. Lewandowski was also at the election night party at the White House last week linked to several virus cases. Numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive in this latest wave of infections, including Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said there would be no easing of a second Covid-19 lockdown in France for at least two weeks, with the number of people in hospital infected by the coronavirus now higher than at the peak of the first wave. Castex said that one in four deaths in the country were due to the virus and that while the R number was now below 1, it was too early to contemplate relaxing measures. He told a news conference: It would be irresponsible to soften the lockdown now. The gains (we are seeing) are fragile. The prime minister said that if the slowdown in the rate of new cases was maintained, France would pass the peak of the second wave early next week. But he said he would not hesitate to impose stricter measures if the spread of infections quickened once more. The virus has killed more than 42,000 people in France. Health authorities reported 35,879 new cases on Wednesday, taking the total to 1.86 million, overtaking Russia and making France the worst-affected country in the European region. "The pressure on our hospitals has intensified enormously," the French prime minister said. Authorities could ease restrictions for Christmas holidays if conditions allow, Castex said. Top Democrats in the US Congress today urged renewed negotiations over a multitrillion-dollar coronavirus aid proposal, but the top Republican immediately rejected their approach as too expensive, continuing a months-long impasse. The House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, ticked off a litany of grim data about the spread of the coronavirus in the US, with eight straight days of over 100,000 new coronavirus cases being reported each day. "It's like the house is burning down and they just refuse to throw water on it," Pelosi said of Republicans. She and Schumer told a news conference that President-elect Joe Biden's victory strengthened the Democratic position, which is to spend at least $2.2tn on another round of coronavirus aid, on top of $3tn Congress has approved since the pandemic began. The Republican president, Donald Trump, has not conceded to Biden. "We're willing to sit down and talk; they haven't wanted to talk," Schumer said, referring to the post-election session of Congress that lasts until the end of the year. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, speaking to reporters in a hallway a few minutes later, said he preferred previous Republican proposals in the range of $500bn. "I gather she [Pelosi] and the Democratic leader in the Senate still are looking at something dramatically larger. That's not a place I think we're willing to go," McConnell said. "But I do think there needs to be another package," the Republican said. "Hopefully we can get past the impasse." In May, the Democratic-majority House approved an additional $3.4tn in coronavirus aid, but it went nowhere in McConnell's Senate, where Schumer's Democrats blocked less expensive Republican proposals. Germany's health minister said today that he expected restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic to continue through winter, with life unlikely to get back to normal in December or January even if infections fall. "I don't see events with more than 10 or 15 people happening this winter," Jens Spahn told the broadcaster RBB. Germany reported 21,866 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 727,553 and jumping back above 20,000 after four days below that figure, while the death toll rose by 215 to 11,982, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of Germany's states are due to meet on Monday to review whether partial lockdown measures imposed on 2 November have been enough to slow a steep rise in new infections that risks overwhelming hospitals. "We all have to be sensible, we have to get down to 50 cases per 100,000 people over seven days," Merkel said today in response to a question on whether the lockdown would end this month. The figure is currently 139 per 100,000. Unlike its first lockdown earlier this year, Germany is keeping its schools and daycare centres open so that parents can go to work, limiting damage to the economy, although at least 300,000 pupils and 40,000 teachers are currently in quarantine. Prof Lothar Wieler, the head of the RKI, said on Thursday that he expected rules to slow the spread of the pandemic in Germany to remain in place for a long while, as a vaccination would take time and there was likely to be an uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 in some parts of the country. The slowing dynamic of infections gave ground for cautious optimism, but it was not yet clear whether this was a stable development, and hospitals were still expected to reach capacity, Wieler added. A potential vaccine candidate being developed in Denmark has in early animal trials proven effective against a mutated novel coronavirus strain from mink discovered in the country, a scientist working on the vaccine said today. Authorities last week embarked on a plan to cull Denmark's 17 million mink, one of the world's largest populations, before running into opposition to the cull. It followed concerns that a recently discovered strain found in mink farms and humans could evade future Covid-19 vaccines. Early studies of the mutated virus strain, known as Cluster 5, showed the virus to have a reduced sensitivity towards antibodies, possibly compromising the efficacy of future vaccines, authorities said last week. But antibodies from rabbits treated with an early-stage vaccine candidate from Denmark's State Serum Institute (SSI) successfully beat down the Cluster 5 variant, according to Anders Fomsgaard, lead scientist at SSI, which deals with infectious diseases. "We couldn't resist testing the rabbit antibodies we have against Cluster 5, and it works," he told Danish broadcaster DR. The vaccine candidate, which is in early stages of development, will soon move to human trials at which it is uncertain if it will have the same effect. "Whether this also applies to other vaccines and whether it applies to human antibodies, we do not know," Fomsgaard said. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a risk assessment today there is "currently high uncertainty" about the potential threat posed by the spread of the virus into mink, its mutations, and its consequent spread back into people. Italy has registered 636 Covid-related deaths over the past 24 hours, up from 623 the day before and the highest figure since 6 April, the health ministry said. The number of new infections also rose by more than 5,000 compared with the previous day - up from 32,961 on Wednesday to 37,978. Infections in Italy since the disease first came to light in February total 1.066m, while 43,589 people have died to date because of the coronavirus. There were 234,672 coronavirus swabs carried out in the past day, the ministry said, against a previous 225,640. The northern region of Lombardy, centred on Italy's financial capital Milan, remained the hardest hit area on Thursday, reporting 9,291 new cases, up from Wednesday's 8,180 Dr Anthony Fauci says unprecedented "polarisation" has intensified an anti-science feeling in the US and led people to threaten violence against him. While the top infectious diseases expert commands respect among much of the public, he has received personal death threats as a result of his high-profile statements about the coronavirus pandemic. The health expert Prof David Heymann, who joined Fauci in a Chatham House webinar, said science had become highly politicised to the point that a mask wearer was seen as a Democrat and a non-mask wearer as a Republican. New infections and hospital admissions have surged in Sweden as the country battles a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic that officials had hoped its light-touch, anti-lockdown approach would mitigate, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian's Europe correspondent. "We consider the situation extremely serious," the director of health and medical care services for Stockholm, Björn Eriksson, told the state broadcaster SVT this week. "We can expect noticeably more people needing hospital care over the coming weeks." Swedish hospitals were treating 1,004 patients for Covid-19, SVT said, an increase of 60% over the previous week's 627. Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control suggests the rise in recent weeks may be Europe's fastest. New infections are also rising, hitting a seven-day average of more than 4,000 this week against fewer than 500 at the beginning of October. The country recorded 4,635 new infections on Thursday. Since the start of the pandemic Sweden - which at one stage in June had Europe's highest per-capita Covid-19 fatality rate - has confirmed 171,365 cases of infections and 6,122 deaths. Its death toll per capita is many times higher than its Nordic neighbours, but lower than countries such as Italy, Spain and the UK. The World Health Organization (WHO) is in discussions with the Russian institute that developed the Sputnik V candidate vaccine against Covid-19 over its potential application for emergency use listing, according to Reuters. In a statement to the Canadian-owned news agency, the WHO said: "We look forward to receiving the data for their Sputnik V candidate vaccine. If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, WHO will publish the results widely." By granting the vaccine emergency-use listing, the WHO would effectively be recommending its use to member states. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results, Russia's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday. The Russian Direct Investment Fund submitted the application for emergency-use listing late last month, according to the Russian state news agency Tass. All schools and other educational institutions in Bangladesh will remain closed until 19 December, the education ministry has said, as the country fears a resurgence of coronavirus infections this winter. The announcement is the latest extension of the schools closure imposed across the country on 17 March. A senior ministry spokesman, who was not named, told Reuters: "The decision has been taken considering the second wave... We can't play with the lives of our children." The government, however, has lifted most other restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Daily infections have shown a rising trend this month, with 1,845 new cases and 13 deaths reported on Thursday. Bangladesh has so far recorded 427,198 coronavirus infections and 6,140 deaths from Covid-19. That gives the country of 164.7 million people an infection rate of 25,101 per million and a Covid-19 death rate of 37 per million, according to the Worldometers website. Nazrul Islam, a virologist and member of the national technical advisory committee to tackle Covid-19, said: The government took the right decision. The coronavirus situation could worsen further in the winter when viral and bacterial diseases increase... People are eager for the vaccine but nobody is caring about the health rules like wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. The government is broadcasting lessons on television for school students, while universities are conducting classes online. Rasheda Choudhury, executive director of Campaign for Popular Education, told Reuters: There are currently no statistics available on the dropout rate. But we fear the figure could be as much as 40%. A controversial French professor who touts the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment - without evidence, scientists say - will appear before a disciplinary panel charged with ethics breaches, an order of doctors said today. Marseille-based Didier Raoult is accused by his peers of spreading false information about the benefits of the drug. His promotion of hydroxychloroquine was taken up by the US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro respectively, who trumpeted its unproven benefits in a way, say critics, that put people's lives at risk. No clinical trials have yet found in favour of using hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19. Critics say that due to potential serious side effects, treating coronavirus patients with hydroxychloroquine is worse than no treatment at all. In June, the British-led Recovery trial team said that hydroxychloroquine does nothing to reduce coronavirus mortality. A group representing 500 specialists of France's Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF) filed a complaint with the national Order of Doctors of the Bouche-du-Rhone department, which includes Marseille, in July. They accused Raoult of breaking nine rules of the doctors' code of ethics. Other doctors and patients have also lodged complaints. On Thursday, the group of doctors confirmed it had given the go-ahead for a disciplinary hearing after reviewing the complaints against Raoult. A hearing will likely only take place next year. Raoult's lawyer, Fabrice Di Vizio, confirmed they had received notice of the decision, but insisted his client would be cleared. If found guilty, Raoult could be fined, warned, or barred from practicing. Raoult, who heads the infectious diseases department of La Timone hospital in Marseille, said in March that his study of 80 patients showed "favourable" outcomes in four out of five treated with hydroxychloroquine. But his peers insist there is no scientific evidence to back up the claim. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited the scientist on 9 April at the height of the pandemic, when the French were observing strict stay-at-home rules. Senegalese children resumed classes today after the government closed schools in March in an attempt to curb the spread of coronavirus in the west African nation. Up to 4 million primary and secondary school pupils were meant to return to classrooms, but the turnout nationwide was unclear. Unicef had said last month that only one in three countries in central and west Africa had reopened schools at the due date for the 2020-2021 academic year. Senegal, a poor nation with a population of about 16 million people, has so far been spared a large coronavirus outbreak. Health officials have registered 15,744 positive cases to date, with 326 fatalities. Only 31 people are currently being treated for the disease in the country. Senegal initially declared a state of emergency when the pandemic reached the country in March, closing schools, imposing a curfew and restricting international flights. The government has since eased or lifted most of the restrictions, with children returning to school the last major antivirus measure to come to an end. About half a million students who were sitting exams were also allowed to return to school late June. The education ministry spokesman, Mohamed Moustapha Diagne, told AFP a protocol is in place in schools involving compulsory face masks, hand-washing and social distancing. But there are concerns that many schools lack protective gear and hand sanitisers, despite government promises to provide them. "We still haven't received a supply of masks and hydro-alcoholic gel," said an official at a primary school in the Dakar suburb of Mbao, who requested anonymity. Most students at the school were not wearing a mask, witnessed an AFP journalist. Abdoulaye Ndoye, from a Senegalese teachers' union, also said that many rural schools had not received the promised supplies. Austria's 24-hour tally of new coronavirus infections surpassed 9,000 for the first time today, with the government coming under growing pressure to introduce tougher measures to bring the outbreak under control. The government has previously said 6,000 new daily infections is the level at which hospitals will eventually be overwhelmed. Earlier this month, the country introduced a partial shutdown until the end of November to slow the spread of the virus. Restaurants, cafes and bars have closed to all but takeaway service while theatres and museums have shut. A nighttime curfew is in place from 8pm to 6am but infections continue to rise. A total of 9,262 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, data from the interior and health ministries showed. The tally was even higher than the 9,105 reported by newspapers Kronen Zeitung and Oesterreich earlier today. The previous record was 8,241, set on Saturday. The first wave of infections peaked at 1,050 a day in March. The Alpine republic's government has said it will assess the situation tomorrow, 13 days after it announced the curfew and partial shutdown, and might announce a further tightening of restrictions. A combination of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine from the Canadian drug developer Medicago and Britain's GSK will enter into large human studies involving more than 30,000 healthy adults, the two companies said today. The news comes days after the companies said the vaccine candidate produced virus-neutralising antibodies in all volunteers in an early-stage study. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US's top infectious disease expert, told a Chatham House webinar that statewide and international cooperation was vital to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Asked what he would do differently if he was in charge of the health response in the US, he said: Even though there's a lot of positive aspects and beauty to the system in the US, namely the independence of the different states, what I would like to see is a much more uniform approach across all the states, because we really are all in this together. When you have an infectious disease, it doesn't matter if you have a country with 50 different states, what happens in one part of the country is going to influence what is happening in another part of the country. Just like when something happens in one part of the world, when you have a respiratory transmittable disease, you can be darned sure it's going to happen in another part of the world. As we move forward, what I would like to see is that uniformity of response. Everyone pulling together, whether you're in the US, EU, UK, anywhere, everyone pulling together at the same time. On the legacy of Covid-19, he said: I would hope that the world realises what we keep saying whenever we get an outbreak, which is that we've got to develop corporate memory and lessons learned for preparation for the next one. There are so many current problems that people have, when you talk about preparing for something that hasn't happened yet, that's a difficult water to carry. I hope that the terrible ordeal that we've gone together globally will not soon be forgotten. When we talk about the kinds of global health security network, the kind of communication and transparency between nations, the mutual respect and interactions that we have [I hope] really get solidified. There isn't anything that we can do about the emergence of new microbes, but what we can do is to control what happens when they do emerge. We certainly can do better on how we handle an emergence. In contradiction to Donald Trump's opinions about the World Health Organization, he emphasised its importance: We need to make sure that the international health structures, the WHO, really get strengthened. It's not a perfect organisation, it has faults that have been pointed out by others, but I think the world does need a global organisation. He stressed that even once we have a vaccine, coronavirus is not going to disappear: I doubt we're going to eradicate this. I think we need to plan that this is something we need to maintain control over chronically. It maybe something that becomes endemic that we just have to be careful of. Certainly it's not going to be pandemic for much longer, because I believe the vaccine are going to turn that around. Fauci hinted that positive data from another vaccine was imminent and also that we should soon have a whole load of additional drugs at our disposal to prevent death/serious illness - monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drug combos - but there were no specifics. The Irish government is confident that it will be able to drop some of the strictest Covid-19 restrictions in Europe on schedule in December following a sharp fall in infection rates, the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said today. "I think everyone is confident now that we will ease restrictions in December," Varadkar told parliament. Rules which have closed all bars, restaurants and non-essential retail and banned non-essential travel more than 5km from home are due to lapse on 1 December, though ministers have said less strict restrictions are likely to remain. The final question put to Dr Anthony Fauci was about the ability of the virus to mutate and whether it would affect a vaccine/therapy. He said he believed the extent to which it could mutate to be limited, so it should not be a problem for the vaccine. He said it was more likely to have an impact on therapy. Dr Anthony Fauci is asked about reinfection. He says it can occur and the durability of immunity is a critical question: "It is definitely finite." We may need to revaccinate intermittently, he says, but at the moment we cannot say what the intervening period would be. Asked about the speed at which the Pfizer vaccine has progressed, Fauci says it is due to "extraordinary science advances". It is speed based on "technical advances", not rashness, he says. Fauci adds that doing the trial in the middle of a fierce outbreak made it easier to test it. Dr Anthony Fauci, speaking virtually at the British thinktank Chatham House, says there has been unprecedented "polarisation" with respect to public health and science in the current pandemic. He says: "I do hope we can turn that around and I think we can." Prof David Heymann says the rejection of science seems particularly high in the United States. He says it has become highly politicised such that a mask wearer is seen as a Democrat and a non-mask wearer as a Republican. Fauci makes clear that there should be wide access to the vaccine, whether you live or die should not depend on where in the world you are. Dr Anthony Fauci said what was needed in the United States was "more uniform implementation of public health measures", such as social distancing and masks. The top US public health expert said the news about the Pfizer vaccine trials should be encouraging to people. He said: Please don't give up, the end is in sight. He questioned why when the US tried to reopen the country it was done in a "disparate way". He said there needed to be a uniform response "because we are all in this together". David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said it was disappointing to see how the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) had been "marginalised". Pope Francis is offering free coronavirus tests for Rome's poor and homeless as part of the Roman Catholic church's World Day of the Poor activities, the Vatican said today. The swabs are being offered at a clinic near St Peter's Square which the pope set up several years ago to provide basic medical care to destitute people, some of whom live on the streets in the neighbourhood around the Vatican. Italy surpassed the 1m infections mark yesterday, leapfrogging Mexico to become one of the top 10 worst-affected countries globally, according to a Reuters tally. Archbishop Rino Fisichella told reporters that up to 50 coronavirus tests a day were being done and the initiative would continue indefinitely. Those who test negative receive a certificate to enter a shelter and those who test positive are directed to further treatment. Many of Italy's homeless are foreigners who do not have a family doctor with the national health system and Italians who become homeless, because of economic difficulties, are often too embarrassed to return to their family doctors. The senior US public health expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, is speaking virtually with the British thinktank Chatham House. You can watch the livestream at the top of the blog. Germany is seeing tentative signs that a surge in coronavirus infections may be easing, officials said today, crediting anti-transmission measures they warned would have to be maintained through winter and beyond. "The curve is flattening," said Lothar Wieler, who heads the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Falling daily new infection figures show "we are not helpless against this virus" and that restrictions such as social distancing and mask wearing can help halt the march of Covid-19, he added. Germany reported 21,866 new cases of Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, according to RKI data. The key reproduction figure (r) has fallen below 1 to 0.89, meaning that 100 people are passing on the virus to 89 others - a sign that transmission is slowing. Despite the encouraging data, the RKI chief said the situation could worsen in coming weeks in hospitals, which may "reach their limits". "We must prevent the situation from deteriorating," he said, stressing Germany's aim is to bring infection numbers down to a level that the healthcare system can cope with. Wieler urged Germans to keep social contacts to a minimum, saying the so-called AHA-L measures would still be necessary even if a vaccine is available because it will take time to roll out the jabs. Under Germany's AHA-L rule mantra, individuals are urged to maintain distances of at least 1.5 metres (5ft), wash their hands regularly, wear masks in indoor or crowded outdoor places as well as airing out rooms. 'A long time' Germany reimposed tough curbs this month to help slow the outbreak, with leisure and cultural centres closing and restaurants and bars only allowed to offer takeaway. Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a new round of talks with regional leaders of Germany's 16 states on Monday to take stock of the situation and examine if the restrictions should be maintained or toughened. Taking questions during a citizens' dialogue, Merkel told a Bavarian hotel manager that if people behaved "reasonably... we might have a chance" of slowly reopening in December. But the veteran leader has also begun managing Germans' expectations for Christmas, saying that she could foresee small family gatherings but no lavish parties. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said it was clear that the Christmas festive season would be accompanied by restrictions. The virus "takes a long time to brake", he told regional radio RBB. "Even if we managed to bring the numbers down now, it doesn't mean that people can just get going everywhere again in December or January. "Partying over Christmas like nothing is going on won't work," he warned. For the health minister, parties with more than 10 people this winter are not on if Germany wants to keep the pandemic under control. With an eye on rising infections in schools, several German states have mooted the idea of lengthening the Christmas vacation to keep the population home and break the chain of transmission. Merkel has warned that only when 60 to 70% of the population has achieved immunity can Covid-19 be deemed to have been "more or less overcome". Russia is another country to report record high number of coronavirus deaths today, with authorities in Moscow warning they could consider imposing additional restrictions if the situation worsened. There were 439 deaths linked to the virus reported in Russia today. Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said he did not expect the surge in cases in the capital, which reported nearly 6,000 new infections today, to subside any time soon. He said about 12,000 coronavirus patients were currently hospitalised. The sprawling city of nearly 13 million people has already ordered bars, restaurants and nightclubs to close at 11pm, and moved university and college students to online learning. "I hope that more restrictions will not be needed, but that will depend on the situation," Sobyanin said in an interview with state television. Nationwide, Russian authorities reported 21,608 new infections over the last 24 hours. Wary of crippling the economy and destroying jobs, they have said they will not reimpose a full lockdown like that seen earlier this year, stressing the importance of hygiene, social distancing and targeted measures in certain regions instead. With 1,858,568 infections since the start of the pandemic, Russia has the world's fifth largest number of cases after the United States, India, Brazil and France. Russia has reported 32,032 deaths to date from Covid-19. Croatia today reported 3,082 new cases of Covid-19, the highest daily number since the global pandemic hit the country nine months ago, although the prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, said the overall rate of increase was slowing. The south-east European nation of 4 million people has registered a total of 75,922 cases of the respiratory disease with 925 fatalities to day. There are now 16,388 active cases. Plenkovic appealed to citizens to respect protective measures. He said: We are in the toughest period of the epidemic, but a good thing we see is that a rise in the number of newly infected is slowing down [over the course of the past week]. Croats are obliged to wear face masks in indoor public spaces and on public transport, while employees are urged to organise work from home wherever possible. But the conservative government has said it will try to avoid a blanket lockdown or a curfew to avoid crippling the economy Dozens of hospital workers have held protests at hospitals in Greece, demanding more medical staff be hired as the country struggles to contain a resurgence of the coronavirus that has led to a new lockdown being imposed. The country's health system has come under increasing pressure due to an increase in the number of people seriously ill with Covid-19. As of last night, Greece had a total of 1,104 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, of which 496 were set aside for Covid-19 patients. Of those, 335 are occupied. The government has stressed it has massively increased the country's intensive care capacity, noting there were a total of just over 500 ICU beds in Greece when it came to power after elections in mid-2019. In a speech this morning on the government's handling of the pandemic, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said: Every humanly possible effort was made so that we can, in the intervening time between the first wave and where we are today, reinforce the ICUs with beds and personnel. Whatever was humanly possible to be done has been done and continues to be done. Mitsotakis said that no matter how many ICUs a country has, "and obviously we prefer to have more rather than fewer, a health system cannot cope if we do not hit the problem at the start of the chain. The start of the chain is the uncontrolled spread of the virus mainly through crowding and contact with people we do not know." The prime minister said the resurgence of the virus in Greece and the rest of Europe was due to "young people having fun. I'm not saying this as criticism, of course young people are more susceptible to such behaviour. But it's an observation and it needs to be heard." In the initial outbreak of the pandemic in the spring, Greece imposed an early lockdown, a move that was credited with keeping the number of deaths and seriously ill very low. But a resurgence of the virus this autumn has led to a rapidly increasing number of people in ICUs, and a sharp increase in deaths. As of last night, Greece's total confirmed coronavirus cases stood at just over 63,300 with 909 deaths in the country of about 11 million people. Iran's death toll from the coronavirus has risen above 40,000 after 457 more fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours. The number of people who have died from Covid in Iran, which has the highest death count in the Middle East, now stands at 40,121. Health ministry data showed the total number of identified cases has reached 726,585. The health ministry spokeswoman, Sima Sadat Lari, told state TV that Iran had identified a further 11,517 new cases over the last 24 hours. Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over the blog. If you want to get in touch you can do so via Twitter @Haroon_Siddique or email haroon[dot]siddique[at]theguardian[dot]com France's minister of economy, Bruno Le Maire, said on Thursday the crucial Christmas season for businesses and shopkeepers could be saved, provided people stick to strict guidelines under the current lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. "What I wish is that we can save December for retailers... What will dictate the decision of the prime minister and of the president is the protection of the safety of the French population," Le Maire told BFM Business radio, according to Reuters. If the population sticks to current guidelines, "we could have a dynamic December", he said. And that's it from me. I am now placing you in the hugely capable hands of Haroon Siddique. Two pieces of sports news. Firstly, the Football Association has said it has asked the government to consider allowing England to play their Nations League match against Iceland at Wembley "by giving travel exemption to the Icelandic team subject to strict medical protocols". Secondly, France 24 is reporting that fans may be asked not to cheer at the Tokyo Olympics to avoid the risk of spreading the coronavirus, a top official said on Thursday. The comments follow a gymnastics test event in Tokyo on Sunday where mask-wearing spectators, urged not to shout or cheer, confined themselves to polite applause and murmurs of approval. Tokyo 2020's chief executive, Toshiro Muto, said fans arriving in Japan may be spared a mandatory two-week quarantine, saying it would be too hard to enforce. But he said officials were also considering urging fans not to shout or talk loudly, to minimise the risk of Covid-19 infections at the postponed 2020 games. "There's a possibility that we might ask the (Olympic) spectators to refrain from shouting or talking in a loud voice," said Muto after a committee meeting. "When we think of the impact, we believe it is an item for consideration, to reduce the risk of airborne droplets." However, Muto added that the "practicality and feasibility" of clamping down on cheering needed to be considered. While sports competitions around the world have resumed after shutting down for the pandemic, most are taking place behind closed doors. Fans are allowed at sports events in Japan, usually in limited numbers, but they are advised not to shout and cheer. President-elect Joe Biden has chosen his longtime adviser Ron Klain to reprise his role as chief of staff, thereby installing an aide with decades of experience in the top role in his White House, AP reports. Klain will lead a White House likely to be consumed by the response to the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to spread across the nation, and will face the challenge of working with a divided Congress that could include a Republican-led Senate. Klain served as the coordinator to the Ebola response during the 2014 outbreak. Klain served as chief of staff for Biden during Barack Obama's first term, was chief of staff to Vice-president Al Gore in the mid-1990s and was a key adviser on the Biden campaign, guiding Biden's debate preparations and coronavirus response. He has known and worked with Biden since the Democrat's 1987 presidential campaign. The choice of Klain underscores the effort the incoming Biden administration will place on the coronavirus response from day one. Klain also played a central role in drafting and implementing the Obama administration's economic recovery plan in 2009. An informative daily infographic showing the up-to-date coronavirus situation in Australia. California is nearing the unwelcome milestone of a million Covid-19 cases, reports AP. For months, the virus has hammered the economy, disproportionately affected the poor, and upended daily life - and now the state and the rest of the country are trying to curb another surge of infections. California will be the second state - behind Texas - to eclipse a million known cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million people comes as the US has surpassed 10m infections. Eleven counties this week have had to reimpose limits. The timeline of Covid-19 in the US often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The death of a San Jose woman on 6 February is the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community. Health officials have warned against get-togethers as the holidays approach and people spend more time indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. Germany's Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Thursday the number of Covid-19 deaths is set to rise and it expects an uncontrolled spread of the disease in some parts of the country, reports Reuters. Global oil demand is unlikely to get a significant boost from the roll-out of vaccines against Covid-19 until well into 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday, a view that is likely to dampen oil price gains since vaccine progress was announced earlier this week. "It is far too early to know how and when vaccines will allow normal life to resume. For now, our forecasts do not anticipate a significant impact in the first half of 2021," the IEA said in its monthly report, reported by Reuters. "The poor outlook for demand and rising production in some countries... suggest that the current fundamentals are too weak to offer firm support to prices." Who's getting their hands on the #Covid19 vaccine? Not frontline healthcare workers in low- and middle-income economies. It's also not time to reinvigorate outdated debates about China, Russia and western scientific races. Interesting article in our Comment section by Clare Wenham, assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, and Mark Eccleston-Turner, lecturer in global health law @KeeleUniversity The Gates Foundation added another $70m of funding on Thursday to global efforts to develop and distribute vaccines and treatments against the Covid-19 pandemic, saying it hoped other international donors would also pledge more. An extra $50m will go to the Covax Advance Market Commitment (AMC) led by the Gavi vaccine alliance, the foundation said, and another $20m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) which is co-funding development of several Covid-19 vaccine candidates, reports Reuters. "We have to ensure that everyone gets equal access to tests, drugs, and vaccines when they are available - no matter where you live in the world," the foundation's co-chair, Melinda Gates, said in a statement. "Our pledge today... means we are getting closer to having the resources needed to help the world fight this virus." Along with the World Health Organization, Cepi and Gavi are co-leading a global scheme known as the Access to Covid-19 Tools (Act) accelerator, which aims to speed up development, production and fair access to Covid-19 drugs, tests and vaccines. European shares retreated from eight-month highs on Thursday as surging coronavirus infections raised doubts about a quicker economic rebound and overshadowed several upbeat quarterly earnings reports, reports Reuters. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 0.7% by 08.04 GMT, taking some of the shine off gains of more than 13% this month that had set it on course for its best monthly performance ever. London's FTSE 100 fell 0.9% as data showed the UK economy grew by a slower than expected 1.1% in September from August, even before the latest restrictions on businesses. The German engineering group Siemens shed 3.4% even as it reported better-than-expected profit at its industrial business in the final set of results overseen by Siemens' long-standing chief executive, Joe Kaeser. Israeli's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said he is working "around the clock" to make a deal with the pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, following promising preliminary results from its Covid-19 vaccine trial. Fearing Israel could be left without an early vaccine, the country's leader said he had held two phone calls with Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla - one at 2am local time on Thursday - in the hopes of signing an agreement. Netanyahu said in a statement that the call was "very warm and cordial" but did not announce an agreement had been signed. "The whole world wants to get [Pfizer's] medicines. We are negotiating with them," he said. Interim results from Pfizer this week suggested that its two-shot vaccine, developed with the German firm BioNTech, was 90% effective. Local media in Israel, a country of 9 million people, reported the prime minister was looking to source about 6m doses. Pfizer has not commented on any deal. Israel has deals in place with at least two other pharmaceutical firms for vaccines and is developing its own, but officials do not expect to start vaccination drives with those unreleased products for several months. AP is looking at whether it is safe to fly during the pandemic. From 1 December, reports the news agency, Southwest Airlines will join United and American in allowing every seat on planes to be sold. JetBlue will scale back the number of blocked seats, and - along with Delta and Alaska - plans to drop all limits some time next year. The airline industry says it is safe to fly, pointing to a report it funded that found the risk of viral spread on planes very low if everyone wears a mask as planes have good ventilation and strong air filters. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that sitting within 6ft of other passengers - sometimes for hours - can still increase your risk of infection. And although airlines are still requiring passengers to wear masks, there is no guarantee everyone will comply. More than 1,000 people who refused to wear masks have been banned by US airlines. Remember, says AP, that flying also means spending time in airport security lines and gate areas, where you might come into close contact with others. In an October travel update, the CDC emphasised the importance of wearing a mask and recommended checking whether infections are rising in the area to which you're travelling. The Philippine health ministry has reported 1,407 new coronavirus infections and 11 more deaths, the lowest daily increase in fatalities in nearly three months. The ministry said total confirmed cases rose to 402,820, while deaths reached 7,721. The Philippines has the second highest Covid-19 cases and deaths in south-east Asia, next to Indonesia. A senior health department official in Delhi has said that Diwali, starting on 14 November, could be "a super spreader event [but] the public just doesn't see the threat", reports Reuters. India has so far reported about 8.6m coronavirus infections - the world's second highest after the US - and 127,571 deaths. But overall, it has been adding fewer cases daily since a mid-September peak, and its fatality figure of 92 per million people is well below the world's tally of 160 and the US's 711. Still, the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research says the recent fall in cases nationally could be undone if there is a resurgence in infections around Diwali. Federal authorities have asked the local government in the capital to prepare resources to handle as many as 15,000 cases a day and test more aggressively. More than half of the city's 16,511 Covid hospital beds were occupied as of Wednesday, government data showed, with more than 24,000 other patients isolating at home. There is no separate data for ICU beds. Indonesia has signed $1bn loan deal with Australia's government to be used to help combat the coronavirus pandemic in the south-east Asian country, Indonesia's finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, said on Thursday. "Everybody, all parts of society, are hurt by this Covid-19 [outbreak] and the role of fiscal policy, together with other instruments, like monetary policy, is very critical during this difficult time," Sri Mulyani told a streamed news conference. Indonesia has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections and fatalities in south-east Asia, with 448,118 cases and 14,836 deaths by Wednesday, according to the country's Covid-19 task force. Italy is experiencing a virus surge with hospitals facing breaking point, according to a report by AP. The Italian doctors federation called this week for a nationwide lockdown to forestall a collapse of the medical system, marked by the closure of non-emergency procedures. The government is facing tougher criticism than in the spring, when the health crisis was met with an outpouring of solidarity. As of Wednesday, 52% of Italy's hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients, above the 40% warning threshold set by the Health Ministry. Nine of Italy's 21 regions and autonomous provinces are already securely in the red-alert zone, above 50% virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75%, Piedmont at 92% and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99%. Lombardy, Italy's most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy's pandemic. The region's hospitals are responding by reorganising wards in a bid to avoid shutting down ordinary care, as happened spontaneously during Italy's first deadly coronavirus spike. But nonetheless, hospitals in Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont - designated red zones by the government last week - have closed surgical, paediatric and geriatric wards to make room for COVID patients. Veneto, still a lowest-tier yellow zone, is preparing to cancel all non-urgent procedures this week. Turkey has banned smoking in public places across the country to curb the spread of Covid-19, AP is reporting. The interior ministry said smoking would be banned in busy streets, bus stops and public squares when necessary. It said the nationwide mask mandate in public spaces, which has been in effect for several months, must be followed at all times and smokers were routinely violating the mask rule. The ministry also said provinces can decide to impose curfews on senior citizens above the age of 65 if they are seeing increases in the number of critical patients. The governors of Istanbul and Ankara have already reintroduced measures this week, allowing senior citizens to leave their homes only between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Turkey has seen a spike in infections since lifting partial lockdowns and reopening businesses in late May. The latest Health Ministry figures show 86 new fatalities in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 11,145. Good morning from GMT - and starting gently with you all, I've got news from Reuters that while lockdown may have shut Czech theatres, Prague residents hungry for entertainment have found that watching a live performance can be as easy as grabbing a takeaway Prague troupe Cirk La Putyka has opened a "Culture Window" at a Prague marketplace building where an audience of up to four outside can watch a five-minute live show of music, acrobatics and dancing inside, while still observing social distancing rules. The window, which opened on Tuesday for two nights of performances, draws its inspiration from pick-up windows for food orders at restaurants that have also been forced to shut dining spaces due to tighter restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus. That's it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I'm handing over to my splendid colleague Amelia Hill. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The US confirmed its highest 24-hour infection total to date - with a world record of 136,000 cases recorded in one day. The US also suffered its highest death toll since early May, with 1,984 coronavirus deaths. Texas passes 1m cases. Texas on Wednesday became the first state with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and California closed in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country. Auckland, New Zealand asks people to work from home tomorrow. The department of health has asked all New Zealanders who live or work in Auckland central city to stay home tomorrow after further details emerged of the mystery case of Covid-19, whose point of infection is as yet unknown. Athletes arriving at Tokyo Olympic Games will be exempt from isolation requirements. Athletes arriving in Tokyo for next year's Olympic Games, postponed from 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be exempt from the 14-day isolation period Japan has imposed on anyone arriving from overseas to help stop the virus spreading. Cyprus has announced partial lockdowns in the towns of Limassol and Paphos to curb a surge in Covid-19 cases. The local measures, which include a ban on travel into and out of the towns and a nightly curfew, will take effect from Thursday and last until the end of November. Sweden's PM, Stefan Lofven, said his government plans to ban nationwide the sale of alcohol after 10pm in bars, restaurants and night clubs from 20 November in an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19. Sweden has witnessed record numbers of new coronavirus infections in past weeks, which is burdening the country's health care system and intensive care wards. Spain's coronavirus death toll surged to over 40,000 with infections passing the 1.4 million mark, while the rate of new cases continued to grow, health ministry data showed. A further 349 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 40,105 in Spain - the fourth-highest within the European Union after the United Kingdom, France and Italy. South Africa will open up travel to all countries and restore normal trading hours of alcohol, despite having the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the continent, in an effort to boost the tourism and hospitality sectors, the president Cyril Ramaphosa said. Officials and doctors in Pakistan urged people to stay at home as the air quality in Lahore deteriorated to hazardous levels, putting an additional burden on the fragile healthcare system amid a surge in coronavirus deaths and new infections. The New York governor Andrew Cuomo imposed a new round of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the infection rate climbed and hospitalisations soared in the state. Taking effect on Friday, Cuomo ordered bars, restaurants and gyms in the state to shut down on-premises services at 10pm nightly, and capped the number of people who could attend private parties at 10. Turkey banned smoking in crowded public places to slow a recent surge in symptomatic patients with coronavirus, as the government warned citizens to abide by protective measures. It comes as daily cases surged to 2,693 on Wednesday. Greek authorities announced stricter restrictions on movement, extending a curfew nationwide after infections broke fresh records, reporting 2,752 new cases on Wednesday. Four days after the country went into a second lockdown to curb the surge in cases, the government said all circulation would be banned between 9pm and 5am. Spain will demand a negative Covid-19 test for all travellers arriving from countries with a high risk for coronavirus from 23 November. Visitors will need to show evidence of a negative PCR test result within the previous 72 hours to be granted entry and officials will be allowed to ask for proof of the test results. Athletes arriving in Tokyo for next year's Olympic Games, postponed from 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be exempt from the 14-day isolation period Japan has imposed on anyone arriving from overseas to help stop the virus spreading. Olympic organisers said on Thursday details still need to be worked out, but measures for athletes are likely to include coronavirus testing within 72 hours before arriving in Japan. But they warned decisions on spectators from overseas have yet to be made, saying a 14-day quarantine was "impossible". "Athletes, coaches and Games officials that are eligible for the Tokyo Games will be allowed to enter the country, provided significant measures are made before they get to Japan," Tokyo 2020 Chief Executive Officer Toshiro Muto told a news conference. Muto was speaking after a meeting between officials from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the national government and Tokyo 2020 organisers on infection prevention procedures during the Games. He said a decision on foreign spectators would be made next year, depending on pandemic developments. "By next spring, we will be coming up with a plan for spectators, including non-Japanese spectators," he said. "It is impossible to set a 14-day quarantine period for foreign spectators, so tests before and upon arrival are needed." Japan has held several recent test events, including a four-nation gymnastics meet last weekend, in which spectators have been admitted, but these were limited to residents of Japan. International Olympic Committee head Thomas Bach is due in Japan for a three-day visit next week, at which Muto said he expected details of coronavirus counter-measures would be ironed out. California looks set to be the second state - behind Texas - to eclipse a million known coronavirus cases. The grim milestone in a state of 40 million comes as the US has surpassed 10 million infections. The state currently has 989,400 cases confirmed. The timeline of Covid-19 in America often comes back to California. It had some of the earliest known cases among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The Feb. 6 death of a San Jose woman is the first known coronavirus fatality in the U.S. That same month, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the first infection spread within the community. On 19 March, Governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home order, shuttering businesses and schools to try to prevent hospital overcrowding. The spread slowed, but California faced the same challenges as other states: providing enough protective gear for health workers, doing enough testing and providing timely results, tracking infections and those potentially exposed. As the state tried to balance public health and the economy, cases rose as it relaxed business restrictions. Eleven counties this week had to reimpose limits. The virus has struck poor Californians and Latinos especially hard. Latinos make up 39% of the population but account for more than 60% of infections. In working-class neighborhoods near downtown Los Angeles, one in five people tested positive at community clinics during the pandemic's early days, said Jim Mangia, president and chief executive of St. John's Well Child and Family Center. Many caught the virus in essential low-wage jobs or on public transit and brought it back to crowded homes. The United States continued to notch up grim records on Wednesday as it battles through the coronavirus pandemic, with a worsening outbreak in the northeast of the country adding pressure on top of an already reeling Midwest, Reuters reports. New Covid-19 infections of 142,279 were at an all-time daily high for a second day in a row and above 100,000 for an eighth consecutive day, according to a Reuters tally. The number of people hospitalised with the virus also surged, to at least 64,939 by late Wednesday, the highest ever during the pandemic. The death toll rose by 1,464. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was the latest state official to impose a new round of social distancing restrictions on Wednesday, in an attempt to protect a state that was the epicentre of the US outbreak in its early stages. The US has reported a total of about 10.4 million cases and 241,809 deaths throughout the pandemic. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 21,866 to 727,553, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 215 to 11,982, the tally showed. Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer, said on Thursday it has made 40 million doses of AstraZeneca's potential Covid-19 vaccine, and would soon begin making Novavax's rival shot, as they both seek regulatory approval. Serum said it has enrolled 1,600 participants in India for late-stage trials of AstraZeneca's candidate, and also plans to seek regulatory approval to run late-stage trials for the Novavax vaccine. The AstraZeneca vaccine, co-developed by Oxford University, is the most advanced in human testing in India, Serum said. Time for a soothing break from coronavirus and capitalism. In Australia, a team of researchers has spotted the elusive bigfin squid in Australian waters for the first time. Two voyages to the Great Australian Bight, one in 2015 and another in 2017, recorded the cephalopod in waters kilometres below the ocean's surface. Bigfin squid - also known as magnapinna - can measure up to seven metres in length: Reuters: Alibaba and JD.com said the United States was the top seller of goods to China during the Singles' Day shopping extravaganza yesterday, which generated about $116 billion in merchandise volume for the pair. Singles' Day is usually a one-day sales event, the world's biggest, eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States. Many online companies offer deals at the event. This year, companies including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc offered promotions over several days, with sales widely interpreted as indicative of China's rebounding post-virus economy. Customers, unable to travel abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic, snatched up deals from brands including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Fast Retailing Co Ltd's Uniqlo. The department of health has asked all New Zealanders who live or work in Auckland central city to stay home tomorrow after further details emerged of the mystery case of Covid-19, whose point of infection is as yet unknown. The student, a young woman, began displaying symptoms on Monday and continued going to work at her customer-facing job in the central city, despite being tested for Covid-19 and being told to stay home. The woman's manager told her to come to work, and wear a mask instead - ignoring health advice. The woman lived alone in a large block of apartments, and all residents there are being asked to stay home until they have all been tested. The woman also took a number of uber's to her job in the central city, and frequently bought food and takeaways from the CBD while she was symptomatic. More information will emerge tomorrow on whether Auckland will need to move up alert levels. An elderly woman living in a care home has become the first person to die of Covid-19 in Gibraltar. The tiny British enclave on the southernmost tip of Spain has managed to keep its numbers under control by adopting an aggressive track-and-trace policy. Chinese airlines will need 8,600 new airplanes worth $1.4tn over the next 20 years, Boeing Co said on Thursday. Boeing's latest estimate for the period to 2039 is 6.3% higher than the U.S. plane-maker's previous prediction of 8,090 planes last year, despite the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic. China will also need $1.7tn worth of commercial services for its aircraft fleet, Boeing said. In the US, celebrations marking Veterans Day gave way to somber virtual gatherings Wednesday, with many of the nation's veterans homes barring visitors to protect their residents from the surging coronavirus that has killed thousands of former members of the US military, AP reports. Cemeteries decorated with American flags were silent as well, as many of the traditional ceremonies were canceled. With infections raging again nationwide, several veterans homes are fighting new outbreaks. In New York City, a quiet parade of military vehicles, with no spectators, rolled through Manhattan to maintain the 101-year tradition of veterans marching on Fifth Avenue. President Donald Trump took part in an observance at Arlington National Cemetery, while President-elect Joe Biden placed a wreath at the Korean War Memorial in Philadelphia. More than 4,200 veterans have died from Covid-19 at hospitals and homes run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and nearly 85,000 have been infected, according to the department. That death toll does not include an untold number who have died in private or state-run veterans facilities, including the Holyoke Soldiers' Home in Massachusetts, which had nearly 80 deaths earlier this year. Two former administrators were charged with criminal offenses after an investigation found that "utterly baffling" decisions caused the disease to run rampant there. American veterans are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 because of their age and underlying health conditions, some of which can be traced to exposure to the Vietnam-era defoliant Agent Orange and smoke from burning oilfields in the Persian Gulf. Across the Pacific: French Polynesia, which has one of the highest incidence of Covid-19 per capita outside mainland Europe, has recorded another 345 Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the archipelago's tally to 11,316. 52 people have died in the pandemic. But this number is likely to rise, with 21 currently in intensive care. French Polynesia had recorded just 62 cases - most in visiting police and military personnel - when it opened its borders in July and abolished mandatory quarantine requirements. But the French territory has since been forced to impose a nightly curfew, and meetings in public have been limited to six people. While France is in a nationwide lockdown, French Polynesia has been exempted. The Vanuatu government locked down the main island of Efate after it recorded its first case of Covid-19 on Wednesday, a citizen repatriated from the United States who tested positive in quarantine. The 23-year old man is asymptomatic and is being held in an isolation ward at Port Vila Central Hospital. "I want to assure our people that the Government will apply strict protocols and Covid-19 measures to ensure the case doesn't spread and our country remains safe," Vanuatu Prime Minister Bob Loughman said. "The situation is under the government's control." The Marshall Islands has declared it is, again, Covid-19, free, after the country's lone case, at the US army base in Kwajalein, was declared free of the virus. "We will have our yellow flags back up this week," the government's chief secretary Kino Kabua said on Wednesday. Yellow flags are used to designate Covid-free status in the Marshalls. "He ceased to pose an infectious threat on 8 November 2020 - his 12th day of supervised and secured quarantine - and has been assessed as recovered and no longer an active case of Covid-19 by his primary physician," a statement from the chief secretary's office said. In several regions of Russia, particularly in Siberia, doctors and patients have reported extreme pressure on emergency services. Russia has the fourth-highest virus caseload in the world with more than 1.83 million registered infections, and over 31,500 deaths. While Moscow remains the epicentre of the outbreak, the regions now account for about three quarters of the country's overall caseload compared to just under half in the spring. In late October, a video that was later confirmed by authorities showed bodies piling up in a morgue in the Altai region. In a small hospital in the Far North, a nurse who asked that her last name be withheld, said she regularly had to take care of around 30 coronavirus patients on her own. But, nurse Alexandra said, she could only use one respirator mask per day. "One of my colleagues quit on her first day. She said she couldn't work in this hell," she told AFP. Concerned that the situation may further deteriorate, many medical workers are moving to Moscow or the second city of Saint Petersburg, which offer better salaries and working conditions in virus units. The chief physician at Moscow's Inozemtsev Hospital, Alexander Mitichkin, has hired about 300 medical workers from around the country. "Some will stay here after the epidemic because we all need the best specialists," he said. Here is the full story on Brazil 's health regulator allowing the resumption of late-stage clinical trials for China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine: Texas on Wednesday became the first state with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and California closed in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country. Reuters: Texas, the second-most populous state, has recorded 1.02 million coronavirus cases and over 19,000 deaths since the outbreak began in early March, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has recorded over 240,000 deaths and more than 10.3 million confirmed infections, with new cases soaring to all-time highs of well over 120,000 per day over the past week. Health experts have blamed the increase in part on the onset of cold weather and growing frustration with mask-wearing and other precautions. Texas reported 10,865 new cases on Tuesday, breaking a record set in mid-July. One of the hardest-hit places is the border city of El Paso; its county has nearly 28,000 active cases and has suffered more than 680 Covid-19 deaths. Here is the full story on New Zealand's mystery Covid case: Stocks in Asia were set to continue their gains on Thursday, buoyed again by continued global stimulus efforts and hopes of a coronavirus vaccine, Reuters reports. Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 shares rose 0.29% in early trading, while Japan's Nikkei 225 futures fell 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures rose 0.56%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.01% higher. The gains in Asia came after a mixed performance for US stocks. The Nasdaq closed up 2% on Wednesday as investors switched back to technology stocks and away from economically sensitive sectors as they weighed Covid-19 vaccine progress and the likely timing of an economic rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 23.29 points, or 0.08%, to 29,397.63 and the S&amp;P 500 gained 27.13 points, or 0.77%, to 3,572.66. The momentum of vaccine hopes and encouraging comments from European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde on continued economic support boosted European shares higher for the third straight session. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.08% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05%. The US dollar rose and the safe-haven yen weakened again on Wednesday as markets continued to adjust to higher interest rates and prospects for economic growth. The Australian dollar was flat versus the greenback at$0.728. The New Zealand dollar was also muted in early trading after it soared on Wednesday to its strongest in a year and a half as traders scaled back bets that the central bank there would move to negative interest rates. Brazil health regulator Anvisa on Wednesday allowed resumption of late-stage Brazilian clinical trials for China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, which had been suspended due to a study subject's death that was registered in Sao Paulo as a suicide, Reuters reports. Brazilian medical institute Butantan said in a statement it would restart trials later on Wednesday. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, a longtime China critic who has baselessly dismissed the Sinovac vaccine as lacking in credibility, had hailed Monday's suspension as a personal victory. Bolsonaro reiterated, however, on Wednesday evening that his government would purchase whatever vaccine is approved by Anvisa and the Health Ministry, which could ultimately include the Sinovac vaccine, if approved. The decision to suspend the trial - one of Sinovac's three large late-stage studies - was criticized by the trial organizers, who said the move had taken them by surprise and that there had been no need to stop the study as the death had no relation to the vaccine. The suspension further inflamed tensions between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who has pinned his political ambitions on the Chinese vaccine that he aims to roll out in his state as early as January, with or without federal assistance. Anvisa, in its statement on Wednesday, said the initial information it received about the case, which led to the suspension, had been incomplete and lacked the cause of the "severe adverse event." It has strongly dismissed suggestions the decision could have been politically motivated. "After evaluating the new data presented by the sponsor... Anvisa understands that it has sufficient reasons to allow the resumption of vaccination," the agency said. "It is important to clarify that a suspension does not necessarily mean that the product under investigation does not offer quality, safety or efficacy," Anvisa added. Sinovac, in a statement said: "We are confident in the safety of the vaccine, fully understand and appreciate Anvisa's strict supervision and timely resumption of the clinical studies." A new, mysterious case of Covid-19 has been recorded in New Zealand's largest city, and so far it has no links to the border or anyone that works there. The person, a university student, became symptomatic on Monday and continued going to their job in the CBD. Authorities believe they may have become infected the previous Saturday, but as yet they are not sure how, or where. Urgent genome testing is underway to see if the case has links to other domestic or international outbreaks, and the student has been placed in a quarantine hotel. The announcement caused concern for many Aucklanders, worried that they may face moving up an alert level. Another press conference on the case is scheduled for 5 pm, local time. More on this soon. Britain is "sleepwalking into a debt crisis" after a steep rise in emergency borrowing by low- and middle-income households to cope with the Covid-19 jobs crisis. Research by the debt charity Stepchange found that household borrowing and arrears linked to the coronavirus pandemic have soared 66% since May to £10.3bn. The number of people who are in severe debt has risen to 1.2 million - nearly doubling since March - with a further 3 million people at risk of falling into arrears after taking on extra short-term loans. Phil Andrew, the charity's chief executive, said: "This report paints a picture of a nation sleepwalking into a debt crisis. Despite a bold initial reaction to the pandemic, the government and financial services sector's toolkit of responses has not evolved, and the result is a spiralling number of people being plunged into debt due to Covid-19. And the worst is yet to come": Mainland China reported 15 new Covid-19 cases for 11 November, down from 17 cases a day earlier, the country's national health authority said on Thursday. The National Health Commission said in a statement that one of the new cases was a local infection in Tianjin. The remaining 14 cases were imported infections that originated from overseas, the commission said. The total number of new asymptomatic cases fell to six from 15 reported a day earlier. China does not count symptomless patients as confirmed Covid-19 cases. The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China to date now stands at 86,299, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. Denis Campbell and Lisa O'Carroll report: Thousands of hospital staff will join the drive to vaccinate all adults in England against coronavirus and will be deployed at mass vaccination centres to give the jab to up to 5,000 people a day, NHS officials involved in the plans said. The NHS intends to use football stadiums, town halls and conference centres in England to inoculate at least 2,000 people each day. The new facilities will be additional to the 1,560 community-based vaccination centres run by GPs, which will dispense 200 to 500 jabs a day. All the venues will do temperature checks on people before entry allowing space for social distancing and a 15-minute recovery time: Hello and welcome to today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. My name is Helen Sullivan, you can get in touch with me here, and I'll be bringing you the latest for the next while. As the US confirmed its highest 24 hours total to date - with a world record of 136,000 cases confirmed in one day, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced new curbs on Wednesday. Restaurants, bars and gyms will have to close at 10 p.m. across New York state, and people will also be barred from hosting private gatherings with more than 10 people. Cuomo says the new restrictions going into effect Friday are necessary because new coronavirus infections have been traced to those types of activities. Businesses can reopen each morning. Cuomo spoke as rates of coronavirus infection continued to rise in New York and elsewhere. He said that 1,628 people were hospitalised across the state for Covid-19 on Tuesday and that 21 people had died. The new closing time applies to all establishments that are licensed by the State Liquor Authority. Only carry-out service will be allowed after that. Here are the other key developments from the last few hours: Cyprus has announced partial lockdowns in the towns of Limassol and Paphos to curb a surge in Covid-19 cases. The local measures, which include a ban on travel into and out of the towns and a nightly curfew, will take effect from Thursday and last until the end of November. Texas became the first US state with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases. California is also closing in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections engulfs the country from coast to coast. Sweden's PM, Stefan Lofven, said his government plans to ban nationwide the sale of alcohol after 10pm in bars, restaurants and night clubs from 20 November in an effort to curb the spread of Covid-19. Sweden has witnessed record numbers of new coronavirus infections in past weeks, which is burdening the country's health care system and intensive care wards. Spain's coronavirus death toll surged to over 40,000 with infections passing the 1.4 million mark, while the rate of new cases continued to grow, health ministry data showed. A further 349 people died in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 40,105 in Spain - the fourth-highest within the European Union after the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Despite having the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases on the continent, South Africa will open up travel to all countries and restore normal trading hours of alcohol in an effort to boost the tourism and hospitality sectors, the president Cyril Ramaphosa said. Officials and doctors in Pakistan urged people to stay at home as the air quality in Lahore deteriorated to hazardous levels, putting an additional burden on the fragile healthcare system amid a surge in coronavirus deaths and new infections. The New York governor Andrew Cuomo imposed a new round of restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus as the infection rate climbed and hospitalisations soared in the state. Taking effect on Friday, Cuomo ordered bars, restaurants and gyms in the state to shut down on-premises services at 10pm nightly, and capped the number of people who could attend private parties at 10. Turkey banned smoking in crowded public places to slow a recent surge in symptomatic patients with coronavirus, as the government warned citizens to abide by protective measures. It comes as daily cases surged to 2,693 on Wednesday. Greek authorities announced stricter restrictions on movement, extending a curfew nationwide after infections broke fresh records, reporting 2,752 new cases on Wednesday. Four days after the country went into a second lockdown to curb the surge in cases, the government said all circulation would be banned between 9pm and 5am. Spain will demand a negative Covid-19 test for all travellers arriving from countries with a high risk for coronavirus from 23 November. Visitors will need to show evidence of a negative PCR test result within the previous 72 hours to be granted entry and officials will be allowed to ask for proof of the test results. The total number of coronavirus cases registered in Italy since the start of the pandemic surpassed the one million mark, the health ministry said. Slovakia's government will extend its state of emergency powers for the rest of the year to battle a surge in coronavirus cases.96193falsefalseLucy Campbell (now); Haroon Siddique, Damien Gayle, Amelia Hill and Helen Sullivan (earlier)Ambulances line up outside the emergency department at the Policlinico di Tor Vergata hospital in Rome.A man stops in front of a booth at a drive-in Christmas market under a large marquee amid the pandemic.Zelenskiy attends an online video-conference with the governmental officials from a hospital where he was hospitalised in Kyiv.With the pandemic reaching record highs in the state of Illinois, all indoor dining and drinking has been banned.Former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, Corey Lewandowski (right) and former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi speak to the media about a court order giving the Trump campaign access to observe vote counting operations in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.The French prime minister, Jean Castex, speaks during a press conference at the French health ministry.Hazmat-clad Peta supporters protest against Danish Fur outside the Embassy of Denmark in London after the Danish government's proposal to kill all minks in the country's fur industry.A schoolboy walks through a classroom on his first day back at school in the popular Yoff neighbourhood in Dakar, Senegal.Healthcare workers hold placards and banners protesting at the Greek government's handling of the pandemic.New circus company shows art through take away window amid coronavirus in Prague.

      <title>Saturday Review:: The Pedant in the Kitchen: Recipe for success: A regular cookbook cull is vitally important</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>How many cookbooks do you have? a) Not enough; b) Just the right number; c) Too many? If you answered b) you are disqualified for lying or complacency or not being interested in food, or (scariest of all) having worked everything out perfectly. You score points for a) and also for c) but to score maximum points, you need to have answered a) and c) in equal measure, a) because there is always something new to be learned, someone coming along to make it all clearer, easier, more foolproof, more authentic; c) because of the regular mistakes made when applying a).</p>
      <p>The main, easily accessible shelf in our kitchen holds 24 books; the two higher shelves 34; the shelf in the hole where the washing-machine lives contains an immediate back-up of 20; there are six in the lavatory, and I would guess another 10 to 15 scattered round the house. Nearly 100, let's say. Is this a) Modest; b) Just right; c) Obscenely large? As before, the correct answer is a) plus c). Every so often, in an attempt to reduce c) to b), a cull takes place, and evidence of various unfulfilled culinary ambitions (a surprisingly high proportion of them relating to stir-fry) will be Oxfammed.</p>
      <p>The next cull, for instance, will have to consider Nigel Slater's juice book, Thirst , which I bought a few months ago. Nothing wrong with the book, I'm sure. The main problem is, we don't have a juicer. It's not that I haven't tried. I once read a newspaper survey of rival machines, and sent off a cheque to someone who proved a fly-by-night merchant. Why did I believe that a firm with apparently green credentials must necessarily be honest? (And yes, I did write to Dear Anna, and she was extremely sympathetic, but . . . well, that's another story).</p>
      <p>So: a juice book but no juicer. The logic points to Oxfam. On the other hand, this could be the year of a successful juicer purchase; and it's a very attractively produced book with a citrus-coloured, rubberised binding you can sponge down when you squirt all over it. Though I suppose you're more likely to squirt all over the open pages, which aren't rubberised - maybe they should have been, like that circa 1900 Paris newspaper printed on vulcanised paper so that you could read it in the bath . . . Oh, all right then, keep Thirst at least until the cull after next.</p>
      <p>If you're just starting up the vertiginous curve of cookbook-ownership, allow me to offer certain words of advice, all of it paid for in money.</p>
      <p>1) Never buy a book because of its pictures. Never, ever, point at a photo in a cookbook and say, "I'd like to make that." You can't. I once knew a commercial photographer who specialised in food, and believe me, the post-production work that recently gave us a slimline Kate Winslet is as nothing compared to what they can do to food.</p>
      <p>2) Never buy books with tricksy layouts: for instance, one with each page sliced horizontally in three so that in theory you can summon up a near-infinite array of three-course meals without having to keep flicking back and forth.</p>
      <p>3) Avoid books with too wide a compass - anything remotely called "Great Dishes of the World" - or too narrow a one: "Sargasso Seafood" or "Waffle Wonderment".</p>
      <p>4) Never buy the chef's recipe book on sale on the way out from a restaurant. Remember: that's why you went to the restaurant in the first place - to eat their cooking, not your version of it.</p>
      <p>5) Never buy a juice book if you haven't a juicer.</p>
      <p>6) Resist, if possible, attractive anthologies of regional recipes, which you are tempted to buy as souvenirs of foreign holidays. I proved this rule with the nec plus ultra of cookbooks, one devoted to Cantal cuisine. It hogged space for years, constantly evading the cull on sentimental grounds, and I never cooked from it once. Cantal food tastes best in the Cantal, where it rains a lot and there is no other choice of cuisine.</p>
      <p>7) Avoid books of famous recipes from the past, especially if reproduced in facsimile edition with period woodcuts.</p>
      <p>8) Never replace your tatty old Jane Grigson or Elizabeth David with a new version containing exactly the same text, even if it does now have pictures (see 1). You will never use it and will go back to the original tatty paper- back because it has your marginal notes and you feel comfortable with it.</p>
      <p>9) Never buy a collection of recipes put together for charity, especially one with TV newsreaders offering the secret of their favourite dish. Just give the cover price direct to the charity: that way, they will get more, and you won't have to cull next time round.</p>
      <p>10) Remember that cookery writers are no different from other writers: some have only one book in them. Consider this possibility when the new one comes out.</p>
      <p>Regular culling - as much as specific purchase - will leave you in the end with a core kitchen library suited to your taste-buds, skill-level, ambition and pocket. Over the years, mine has ended up being built around the following: one encyclopaedia (Alan Davidson's immense Oxford Companion to Food having ousted the Larousse), two classic compendia ( The Joy of Cooking and Constance Spry), two triple-decker course-books (Prue Leith and Delia), half a dozen Jane Grigsons, three or four Elizabeth Davids, three Marcella Hazans, two River Cafes, a couple of Simon Hopkinsons, one Alastair Little, one Richard Olney, one Jocelyn Dimbleby, one Frances Bissell, one Myrtle Allen, one Rowley Leigh.</p>
      <p>These are books in regular use; nearby are several dozen in occasional service. Some books I only ever consult for a single recipe: such as Margaret Costa's Four Seasons Cookery Book for smoked haddock souffle, or Susan Campbell's English Cookery New and Old for autumn pudding (a far superior version of summer pudding, with elderberries, blackberries and crab apples).</p>
      <p>Why, since these are so trustworthy, don't I try others from the same book? I don't know. Then why not photocopy the one recipe you use, paste it into your own recipe book and Oxfam the original? Because a continuing loyalty to the actual page on which the recipe was first read somehow prevents this.</p>
      <p>Ah yes, your own recipe book. You will need some kind of small scrapbook or filing system for all those newspaper and magazine cuttings. Another word of advice: don't stick them in until you've made the dish at least twice and know it has some chance of longevity.</p>
      <p>Such a book will, over the years, testify to the strange trajectory of your cooking. A cuttings cookbook will bring back moments in the same way as a photograph album. I used to make that? And that really stodgy vegetable pie? And that thingy in filo pastry which used to make me so cross? And didn't I cook this the night when . . . You will be surprised by how much emotional and psychological history you might be storing up when you innocently paste in a slightly stained newspaper clipping.</p>
      <p>And now I think I'll go out and buy a juicer. So that I won't have to throw out my juice book next time, or next time but one.</p>

      <title>Divine inspiration: how high church led to high fashion</title>
      <subtitle>Heavenly Bodies, the New York Met's latest show, pairs the Catholic church with haute couture - and is set to be a sensation. The celebrated curator behind it explains why it all began in Blackburn</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It's a long way from the grey skies of Lancashire to the glitz and flashbulbs of the global fashion event of the year, the Gala at New York's Metropolitan Museum. But when the world's A-list fashionistas step out on its red carpet in a week's time, they'll be linked by an invisible thread to the mill town of Blackburn in the 1970s - and a Catholic schoolboy whose adolescence there was filled with the drama, the theatre and most of all the costumes of the church services at which he found himself.</p>
      <p>That boy grew up to be the curator in chief of the Costume Institute at the Met. His name is Andrew Bolton, and today he's one of the most influential, if low-key, figures in the world of fashion. His is the brain behind the theme for both the Met Gala and the accompanying costume exhibition which opens three days later - and it all links to his upbringing, his education and his childhood faith.</p>
      <p>Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination will explore the links between Catholic imagery and the creation of couture design; themes which Bolton says have never been properly explored on this scale, and which could help lift the costume galleries of the Met and other museums round the world out of their second-class silos forever. It will connect works of ecclesiastical art in the Met directly to couture, as a series of interventions: the Byzantine galleries will feature fashions inspired by church interiors, the medieval sculpture hall will look at fashions paired to holy orders, while the Met's second site, the Cloisters - suitably enough, since it is a reconstruction of a medieval monastery - features designers inspired by monastic orders. Also on show will be more than 50 vestments borrowed from the Sistine Chapel collection, many of which have never previously left the Vatican. They will be shown in a separate space from the fashion, says Bolton, to preserve the sense of sacred - some are still used during services.</p>
      <p>Being raised Catholic and immersed in it, has fired the imaginations of many designers</p>
      <p>For Bolton - tall, lean and owlish in dark-rimmed glasses - it's hard to overestimate the importance of this exhibition in his already stellar career. "It's the show I've always wanted to do. It's all about the influence of Catholicism on designers, about the links between the church's imagery and creativity. Being raised Catholic, being immersed in this tradition, has fired the imaginations of so many designers." It is, he says, the narrative impulses of the designers that are the deepest and most profound expressions of their Catholic imaginations: and while the high-octane fashions that are featured in the show might seem a long way from the sanctity of the church, he believes they embody its storytelling tradition.</p>
      <p>Bolton's thinking of luminaries including the Spanish Cristóbal Balenciaga (1895-1972) - "He was probably the most devout; he thought seriously about becoming a priest" - and the Italian surrealist Elsa Schiaparelli (1890-1973), who was baptised in St Peter's Basilica. They both feature in the show, Schiaparelli with her evening dress of 1939 embroidered with the "keys of the kingdom" given by Christ to St Peter; Balenciaga with his sleek wedding dress of 1967, making his bride nun-like in its simplicity and wing-like veil. Then there's Gianni Versace (his sister Donatella, along with Anna Wintour, Amal Clooney and Rihanna, are the official hosts for this year's Met Gala), whose gold evening dress of 1997 is emblazoned with a cross that runs from collar to hem and breast to breast. Jean Paul Gaultier, another Catholic, is represented by a dress from his heavily religious spring/summer 2007 collection, inspired by stained glass and with an image of Christ à la Madonna and Child nestled across one shoulder; Dolce &amp; Gabbana, by pieces from their autumn 2013 collection, which featured saints in a heavily jewelled print inspired by the Byzantine mosaics in Sicily's Monreale Cathedral.</p>
      <p>The more he looked for church-inspired fashion, says Bolton, the more he found. From the House of Chanel's 2008 collection there's a jewelled gilet that looks like a collection of Rosary crucifixes, and Coco herself, he discovered, always carried a prayer-card of St Thérèse. Perhaps the most Pope-like outfit of all is a John Galliano evening dress from his autumn/winter collection 2000. It is full-length cream and gold with jewels and a mitre. Other designers represented in the show, also raised Catholics, include Jeanne Lanvin, Christian Lacroix - and Bolton's own partner Thom Browne, one of Michelle Obama's favourite designers (she wore a Browne coat-dress for her husband's second inauguration day).</p>
      <p>When I meet Bolton, at the press launch for Heavenly Bodies, Browne is also in attendance, wearing one of the short suits (fitted blazer with trousers cut off above the knee) that are his signature item. The event, held at a palazzo in central Rome, is swirling with stylish celebrities and top-level clerics. Donatella is there, wearing one of her own-label designs in strong block colours, while Wintour, after whom the space of the Met that houses the costume institute is named, is resplendent in a sumptuous, long velvet dress in cardinal red. Wintour almost upstages - but thankfully only almost - the real-life cardinal who is there to give the event the Vatican's seal of approval, Gianfranco Ravasi, the head of the Pope's culture department. Ravasi's scarlet robes are, he says, the dress-down version of a top prelate's wardrobe, certainly compared with the intricately embroidered copes and jewelled mitres that will be on display at the Met for Heavenly Bodies.</p>
      <p>In this company, Bolton is understated. He's wearing a dark suit that's unremarkable save for the ankle-length trousers, another Browne signature. Those, together with his slightly foppish side-fringe, give him, at 51, an air of endearing boyishness. In Rome, as in New York, his Englishness singles him out, as does that of Wintour, with whom he works closely. But Bolton is a lot warmer than the famously icy Wintour. He's easy to chat with and seems slightly out of place in this see-and-be-seen world. He is someone whose passions got him to where he is, rather than any desire to be noticed. Bolton says he didn't think about becoming a priest, but it's clear he considers what he does as a vocation. And what it all comes down to, he says, is telling stories - and more than that, allowing the objects to tell their own stories.</p>
      <p>"That's very much what I believe in," he says. "I don't see objects as being passive. Sometimes I think curators overload an object with interpretation. I want the object to tell its own story."</p>
      <p>Bolton's most spectacular opportunity to let objects tell their own story came in 2011, when he staged the show that gave him his curatorial crown, Savage Beauty - the seismic, game-changing exhibition of the work of Alexander McQueen. Consisting almost entirely of exhibits, with barely any biographical information or background about the complicated life of their creator, whose early life was marred by sexual abuse, it took visitors on an emotional as well as a visual rollercoaster through the most spellbinding costumes created by the man known as the enfant terrible of British fashion. There was a razor clam seashell dress; a skirt made of plywood; a gold feathered dress; a headdress of dozens of bright red butterflies...</p>
      <p>The show was a sensation and the Met was swamped. There were five-hour queues for entry, and for the first time the museum stayed open until midnight to cope. All this took the institution entirely by surprise because, as his predecessor at the Costume Institute, Harold Koda, often said, and Bolton is fond of quoting: "The Costume Institute is like the Met's pretty little sister. It gets all the dates but none of the respect."</p>
      <p>But that is changing under Bolton - and how. He says he hates the word "blockbuster", but there's no doubt that's what's in everyone's mind for Heavenly Bodies, which will be the biggest exhibition ever mounted at the Met, encompassing 25 galleries in all, and linking the two Met sites for a show for the first time. It will be, says Bolton, "like a pilgrimage... visitors will make the journey from one site to the other". He hopes to take the art world on a journey, too, from the outdated view that costume galleries were fusty old second-class areas of museums located in basements, to a new dawn in which they are given what he would see as their rightful place alongside the paintings and objects that have always been regarded as artistic heritage. Linking costume with Catholicism, the faith that inspired the Renaissance, is clearly and unashamedly a step in that direction. "What you'll see," he says, "is fashion, art and religion intertwined."</p>
      <p>Religious dress and fashion are not distinct entities, both operate as a visual language</p>
      <p>Bolton's exhibitions - last year's centred on the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, founder of Comme des Garçons; the previous year's was Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology ; before that, China: Through the Looking Glass - always have a strong personal pull for him, and he called Savage Beauty "an unapologetic love poem to McQueen". Just like McQueen, who never flinched from confronting difficulties in his own life through his art, Bolton doesn't shy of bold, controversial decisions. He first mooted the idea of Savage Beauty with the then director of the Met, Thomas Campbell, the day after McQueen's suicide. The show was staged barely a year later. Some said it was too soon. Bolton understood the power of the tragedy, the impact of the moment.</p>
      <p>Heavenly Bodies won't be without its critics, as Bolton is well aware. There will be traditional Catholics who won't like the idea of working vestments being displayed as museum exhibits and who may feel the exhibition trivialises their faith, and liberal Catholics who will eschew the messages of hierarchy and rank and privilege inherent in items that are intricately decorated at great cost, both financial and in terms of time (one piece, says Bolton, took 15 women 15 years to complete). But while some will dislike the reminder of how elite top-ranking Catholic clerics have traditionally been, and others will argue that Pope Francis is steering Catholicism away from the kind of church that required opulent and lavish costumes, it's undeniable that the costumes of the intricate, majestic and often downright camp liturgies of the Catholic church link in a very vivid way to the world of designer fashion.</p>
      <p>And while Pope Francis may eschew papal pomp, preferring a Fiat to a limo (until as recently as 1978, popes were carried on a ceremonial throne called the gestatorial chair - it was replaced, by John Paul II, by the mechanised Popemobile), he is well aware of the power of symbolic costume. He's never seen in anything other than a dove-white cassock or a chasuble and, unlike his predecessor Benedict XVI, he doesn't bother with the traditional red designer loafers. For Bolton, "religious dress and fashion are not distinct entities... both operate as a visual language relying on subtle visual codes to perform specific functions and to explain complex ideas and identity."</p>
      <p>The Sistine Chapel loans for the show include the golden cope of Pope Benedict XV (who reigned from 1914 to 1922), the chasuble and mitre of his successor Pius XI and the 19th-century dalmatic of Pius IX, which features a scene from the crucifixion, as well as his heavily jewelled tiara. And while Pope Benedict's famous red loafers won't be on show, those of his predecessor John Paul II will be. It all underlines, says Bolton, the fact that the finest costumes in history were always either imperial or ecclesiastical. "There's the secular court, and there's the court of the church. And there was a very fluid relationship in the Middle Ages between elite culture and fashion. Catholic church leaders were very much the elite of those times."</p>
      <p>What's also interesting, he says, is that fashions designed for male churchmen have been adapted for what are largely women's outfits. That's especially significant given that one of the reasons costume galleries have traditionally been given second-class status is because they're seen as mostly connected with women and their lives. But most of all, and magically, there's the overriding sense of mystery and awe and wonder, the transportation literally to another world, that links both the garb of the church and the world of designer fashion. No wonder, he says, that a fashion show seems almost like a religious ceremony. "Have you ever thought of the parallels there? There are active participants and passive participants, there's music, there's a procession..."</p>
      <p>Originally, Heavenly Bodies was conceived as an exhibition exploring the influence on fashion of all five major religious traditions. "But as time went on we realised there was a huge imbalance between designers who were from the Catholic tradition, and those from the other faiths," says Bolton. What that's about, he believes, is a complex cocktail of ingredients that unite in Catholicism to fire up and liberate artistic creativity. "There's the idea of storytelling, and there's also the visual culture, which is fascinating and colourful."</p>
      <p>Bolton owes his own front seat on this complicated world mostly to his time at St Mary's College in Blackburn. He went there at 16 and at that moment, he says, "my education really started". Raised in a middle-class family, one of three children - his father was in publishing, his mother a nurse - he says his parents' ambitions were orthodox. "They were thinking in terms of us being lawyers and doctors," he says. But he was in the choir at school and loved it, and he always enjoyed the theatre of mass. He went on to study anthropology at UEA and stayed on as a postgraduate. "But what stopped me was realising I would never be as good as the good guys. I was too bourgeois to be an anthropologist."</p>
      <p>One day a paper fell out of a book he was holding, and it turned out to be an application form for a job as curatorial assistant at the V&amp;A. From the moment he got the job, he's never looked back. Arriving there felt, he says, like going home. But it was his move nine years later, in 2002, to the Met that brought him to the forefront of the international gallery and fashion scene. He joined as associate curator, and since 2016 and Harold Koda's retirement, he has been the Wendy Yu Curator in Charge of the Costume Institute.</p>
      <p>In his private life, meanwhile, he and Browne have been together for the past seven years - presumably they wholeheartedly approve of the most famous quote of Pope Francis's pontificate, which is his admission "Who am I to judge?" when questioned about homosexuality. The couple live in Manhattan with their dachshund, Hector, who they're both devoted to.</p>
      <p>As the critics gear up for the opening of Heavenly Bodies, and the fashion world prepares to be wowed by a series of priestly themed outfits on the red carpet, Bolton's hope must be that with this show he will hit the same jackpot as with Savage Beauty, to which everything he ever does is invariably compared. He believes that what he has to say about the links between church and fashion are transformational - and if he ever says a prayer to the God of his childhood, here's betting he'll be saying one now.</p>
      <p>Heavenly Bodies runs from 10 May to 8 October at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ( metmuseum.org )</p>

      <title>Football: England v Holland: Pearce is a man of contradictions - a country squire with a twist: Caretaker admits to being 'pretty lightly raced' as a manager in the run-up to his first big test at Wembley</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Scene One: The late 1980s. Nottingham. It is a little after 8am, Stuart Pearce's mud-spattered Volvo estate, complete with straw bales in the back, swings into the City Ground car park. Having agreed to a rare interview he heads into the Nottingham Forest supporters' social club where a cleaner is telling the waiting reporter that Brian Clough's left-back is one of the "good guys".</p>
      <p>Pearce talks about the love of horses instilled in him by his girlfriend, Liz, scathingly deconstructs the widespread convention that young footballers should marry at the earliest opportunity and marvels at the way his life has changed since the days when he worked as an electrician for Brent council, spent Friday nights at Wembley dog track and Saturday's playing for non-league Wealdstone.</p>
      <p>Scene Two: The late 1990s, Newcastle. Pearce sits at a table in an Italian restaurant, drinking water and talking football with his then team-mate Warren Barton and their wives. Approaching retirement, the former England captain is at a stage in his career when many peers would shrug before quietly pocketing the money, but things are running less than smoothly at St James' Park and he is earnestly outlining a prescription for change. A study in almost evangelical intensity, he contradicts the view of professional footballers as cynical pragmatists who rarely care too deeply.</p>
      <p>Scene Three: February 2012: Pearce, newly anointed as England's caretaker manager, crosses the border into Berkshire from his Wiltshire home to launch an after-school club for under-11s and present prizes to some technology-college pupils. The England Under-21 and Great Britain Olympic football coach is adept at body-swerving interview requests but when a young, local newspaper reporter politely requests a chat, Fabio Capello's temporary successor obliges. "It's a bit of a shock," he says. "But I'm immensely proud."</p>
      <p>When it comes to categorising the qualities fans seek from an England coach, Pearce ticks an awful lot of boxes. Grounded, non-materialistic, unselfish, rarely precious, patriotic, passionate, hard-working, willing to challenge orthodoxies, scrupulously fair to referees, slightly unconventional and robustly no-nonsense, he could almost serve as an identikit of England's ideal manager.</p>
      <p>Almost, but not quite. Tactical reservations aside, he can be far too intense for his own good and remains alarmingly highly strung. Sometimes the latter characteristic leads to moodiness and, rarely, rage.</p>
      <p>In the course of countless games playing against and alongside him, Gary Lineker only recalls his England team-mate smiling "once", but treating management similarly seriously has, on occasion, proved to be counter-productive.</p>
      <p>During the Under-21s' 2009 European Championship 4-0 defeat to Germany in the Malmo final, a frighteningly ferocious Pearce appeared poised to invade the pitch and thump Sebastian Boenisch after the full-back clattered into James Milner, before somehow pulling himself back from the brink of implosion.</p>
      <p>A carefully constructed mask had slipped. Since retiring from playing at 40, Pearce, ever assiduous, has attended so many coaching and business-management courses that his sentences are often studded with corporate jargon. At times of stress, though, this measured, diligently acquired, facade can give way to "Psycho's" old default-setting - the in-your-face aggression which made him arguably the world's most intimidating left-back and once, infamously, resulted in him biting one of the nipples of Derby's Ted McMinn.</p>
      <p>If, even then, such fury was usually controlled - as a professional Pearce was sent off only five times - these days he is more synonymous with the sort of strategic thinking which saw his Under-21 side qualify for the last three European tournaments.</p>
      <p>Their record, in reaching a semi-final and that 2009 showpiece before exiting after the group stage in Denmark last year, is credible but Pearce's critics argue that when backed into a tactical corner his cautiousness takes over and he invariably resorts to long-ball tactics. Significantly, England attempted more unsuccessful long passes than any other team in Denmark.</p>
      <p>In mitigation, Pearce retorts that he is a "pretty lightly raced" manager who, despite approaching his 50th birthday, has only taken charge of around 160 games having retired from playing considerably later than many of his contemporaries.</p>
      <p>David James, who played for him during a rather underwhelming stint at Manchester City, endorses the point. "At City he was all roll up your sleeves and growl at people," the former England goalkeeper said. "Since then he's evolved into a seriously good international manager with a completely different style and approach."</p>
      <p>No one doubts his work ethic. Last summer a diligent streak which has seen Pearce attend 14 games since becoming England caretaker, involved him travelling, voluntarily, to Colombia and serving as Brian Eastick's assistant during the Under-20s' World Cup. Eastick's England were eliminated by Nigeria in the first knockout round, with Pearce unconcerned about status in the back-seat role.</p>
      <p>Some managers have to dominate every room they enter but as Pearce informed British troops in Afghanistan during a recent, reportedly hugely inspiring, speech at Camp Bastion, "being unselfish" is a trait shared by all great leaders.</p>
      <p>As a former head girl at Ted Edgar's highly successful showjumping yard, Pearce's now wife, Liz, does not lack leadership qualities of her own. A talented horsewoman who early in their relationship had him happily mucking out loose boxes, she is no stereotypical WAG. While they regularly rehouse former racehorses at their Wiltshire stables, she is also credited with sparking an interest in the theatre and reading in a man who left school with five CSEs (grades D-E).</p>
      <p>The father of Chelsea - at 12, already a star of her pony club - and eight year-old Harley, Pearce has become a country squire with a twist. Or at least one boasting a tattoo on an arm. "It's supposed to be an eagle set against the sun," said its owner, who acquired it in Stanmore as a "bored" teenager. "But it's been described as a porcupine having a period."</p>
      <p>A dedicated punk devotee, the Stranglers remain a particular favourite, he is pictured on the inside sleeve of a Lurkers album, God's Lonely Men, but has not courted either fame or celebrity friends.</p>
      <p>"Stuart was never obsessed with the media, money or cars," said Roy Keane, who played alongside him at Forest. Indeed after succeeding Kevin Keegan as manager at Manchester City, Pearce worked for months without the security of a contract, even debating whether he would deserve paying off should results founder.</p>
      <p>Having grown up in north London, where his father variously worked unsociable shifts as a postman and a waiter at Quaglino's in Mayfair, he qualified as an electrician on leaving school. After finally being offered a professional contract by Coventry, Pearce kept his hand in, initially earning more from rewiring houses than playing football.</p>
      <p>If such industry amused his team-mates they were amazed that, while with Wealdstone, he had secretly continued playing for his pub's Sunday side, Dynamo Kingsbury Kiev, having registered as Yak Jensen, supposedly a Russian goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>In reality, Pearce is almost absurdly proud to be English. Unswervingly patriotic, he has flown a St George's cross from a flagpole in his garden and could surely work wonders for the UK tourist board. "I've travelled the world," he said. "And it's made me appreciate what we've got: London, the Cotswolds, tradition, the FA Cup."</p>
      <p>Having reiterated, emphatically, that he does not share the politics of his BNP-supporting older brother, Dennis, he was dismayed at the recent recounting of a near two decade-old incident which saw him apologise to Paul Ince for a racist remark made during their playing days.</p>
      <p>Paul Parker, then, like Ince, a Manchester United player, has defended Pearce. "The comments would have come out of ignorance not bigotry," said Parker. "I recall an incident playing for England when one of the opposition said something racist to Des Walker. The first person to stand up for Des was Stuart. He let this guy know exactly what he thought of him."</p>
      <p>If Pearce has always been ultra loyal, he is also quick on the uptake. "I've had my moments but I've learnt from them," he said, referring to a youthful arrest for scaling traffic lights in Wembley. "I've been up a traffic light, but only once."</p>
      <p>Should those signals be held on green as police out-riders whisk England's team bus towards Wembley Stadium tomorrow, the caretaker manager will doubtless permit himself a private smile.</p>
      <p>Off the pitch:</p>
      <p>There's more to Stuart Pearce than the game that made his name</p>
      <p>Three-chord wonder</p>
      <p>On June 23 1996, the day after he had scored in England's penalty shootout victory over Spain at Euro 96, Pearce introduced the Sex Pistols' Filthy Lucre show at Finsbury Park, their first gig for 18 years</p>
      <p>Terms of employment</p>
      <p>Pearce trained as an electrician but before that had worked in a factory in Stonebridge for a year in the packing department and served behind the bar at Wembley Stadium</p>
      <p>Local hero</p>
      <p>Pearce lives with his family in Wiltshire where his wife, Liz, stables retired racehorses. When Pearce was appointed as manager of the London 2012 football team, the Wiltshire Gazette &amp; Herald headlined the news: "Shalbourne's Pearce named Team GB boss"</p>
      <p>Mr Beanie</p>
      <p>When managing Man City he used to prop a toy horse called Beanie by the touchline. Neil Warnock retaliated with Scottie the teddy bear.</p>
      <p>Captions:</p>
      <p>Scenes from a life Tackling issues at Coventry; following Brian Clough out at Wembley for Nottingham Forest at the League Cup final against Luton; celebrating success in the penalty shootout for England against Spain at Euro 96; and calling the shots as manager of Manchester City</p>

    <text>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.59am BST</p>
      <p>92 min: Poor old Marco Kurz. His side had done just about everything he could have hoped for. And with minutes to go, whamo. A season's hopes and dreams snatched away at the death!</p>
      <p>Five minutes added on, but here come the Muscat changes, he makes two, two minutes apart as first Berisha then George are withdrawn.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.57am BST</p>
      <p>Goal!! Melbourne Victory 2-1 Adelaide United (Berisha)</p>
      <p>89 min: Would you believe it! With extra-time seemingly a fait accompli, a piece of pure and simple individual brilliance from Besart Berisha to decide this gripping encounter!</p>
      <p>Barbarouses again down the right hand flank, he dinks a cross, Berisha shields his marker Elsey as the ball dips, and he then flicks the bicycle kick effort - which nestles just inside Izzo's far post!</p>
      <p>What a goal, and what a time to score it!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.52am BST</p>
      <p>86 min: Marco Kurz looking to make his third and final change as George Blackwood comes on for Diawara. Kevin Muscat in contrast yet to shuffle his XI. Does this show greater trust in the chargers that started, or conversely a lack of faith in those on the bench?</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.53am BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.50am BST</p>
      <p>84 min: So will we see extra-time here? Still a fair chunk of time to run, and it's definitely been a more open second stanza.</p>
      <p>There are seven players out there on a yellow as well, might that fact yet play a decisive part?</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.48am BST</p>
      <p>81 min: And it's an untidy first contribution from Vinny - he's picked up a yellow for a late attempt on Antonis. The midfielder and Instagram chef flashes a rueful smile.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.45am BST</p>
      <p>78 min: Kitto has been lively since his inclusion with his pace worrying the Victory down the flanks. He fires in a cross, but can't find a teammate. Meanwhile Berisha goes into the book for finishing despite an earlier whistle.</p>
      <p>And cometh the moment, cometh the man - are we about to see former Victory player and Wellington cult figure, Vince Lia enter the fray? Yes we are.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.42am BST</p>
      <p>75 min: There were times during the first elimination final where you thought it simply not a game of the quality befitting the occasion. But this has turned into a terrific spectacle - a tasty clash of cut, thrust and counter-parry.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.43am BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.38am BST</p>
      <p>71 min: Adelaide with a half-chance from an Adlung set piece. Gulum wins a big flick on at the near post, but with the ball looping temptingly to the far post there's nobody there in Red to tap it home!</p>
      <p>Ryan Kitto comes on for Mileusnic as we see our first substitute of the match.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.39am BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.36am BST</p>
      <p>69 min: Huge save! Victory with a great break, George picks out Berisha at the far post - he fires it across the goal past Izzo, who sticks out a strong left foot and repels the strike!</p>
      <p>How crucial could that prove?!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.34am BST</p>
      <p>66 min: Well that's raised the decibel level inside AAMI Park! A nervous hush had fallen on the ground when Adelaide took the lead, but the home supporters have found their voice once more.</p>
      <p>A few cards creeping in here. Diawara in the book (for reason your humble scribe can't explain) and then Broxham for a heavy foul.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.31am BST</p>
      <p>Goal! Melbourne Victory 1-1 Adelaide United (George)</p>
      <p>63 min: Barbarouses with a mazy dribble outside the box from the right - he dinks in a tempting cross, it evades Berisha but the Dutchman George just gets ahead of Marrone, and it angles into the side of Izzo's goal.</p>
      <p>What a response from the home side!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.29am BST</p>
      <p>62 min: Gulum getting through a power of work at the back for the Reds. Such an experienced character. But hold on, hold on..</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.25am BST</p>
      <p>Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Adelaide United (Mileusnic)</p>
      <p>57 min: Terrific quick thinking from the Reds - Isaias with a freekick from deep inside his own half, he looks up, spots the run of the lightning winger and puts it brilliantly over his shoulder.</p>
      <p>The winger outpaces Williams and nips in just ahead of the on-rushing Thomas to touch home inside the post.</p>
      <p>Game on! This will force Victory to chase a little more proactively.</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 10.27am BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.22am BST</p>
      <p>55 min: Chance, Victory! George with a freekick in a handy area, his ball in is dealt with, but not cleanly. It falls invitingly and Valeri lashes back goalwards. It strikes Jordan Elsey, replays suggesting the arm, but perhaps ball to hand. It was not in an 'unnatural' position, so Master Beath and the VAR let it go.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.18am BST</p>
      <p>51 min: A big flashpoint, and no surprise it's Victory's captain Valeri in the middle of it. He's given a yellow for a very 'agricultural' challenge on Gulum. He's gone clean through the Turkish-Australian centre back, and he's caught him high as well. Lucky perhaps not to receive a red for that?</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.15am BST</p>
      <p>48 min: Antonis almost tempts fate as he looks to dribble out from his own box, but his decision to retain possession nearly pays off as he then picks out Barbarouses, but the Kiwi's ball through to Berisha is too heavy, and the move is snuffed out.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.12am BST</p>
      <p>Second half: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Adelaide United</p>
      <p>And we're back! No changes from either side at half-time, unsurprisingly given the even nature of the contest.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 10.00am BST</p>
      <p>How'd you see that half? And who do you fancy to be the one to unlock this one?</p>
      <p>Fire me a tweet or drop an email to join the coverage. I'm calling this early and saying either extra-time and penalties (Adelaide win), or in the spirit of proper hedging, a half-mistake at the back/contention Berisha moment, and Victory jag 1-0.</p>
      <p>Send me your most fervently held predictions; failing anything it'll be a good giggle come full-time.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.58am BST</p>
      <p>Half-time: Melbourne Victory 0-0 Adelaide United</p>
      <p>So a tense and terse opening first stanza in this one, with neither side enjoying any real clear cut chances. Isaias' early freekick the only real goal moment of note, with both midfields working hard to neutralise each other.</p>
      <p>Melbourne with 58% possession, but George and Barbarouses aside they haven't troubled the Reds defence too much. Expect this one to open up more in the second half.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.53am BST</p>
      <p>45 min: Two minutes the extras. There haven't been too many stoppages in this, but referee Beath does warn Izzo in the Adelaide goal for some tardy restarts.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.51am BST</p>
      <p>43 min: Garuccio flashes a cross.. but it evades his teammates! Both he and Michael Marrone more natural attackers when the Reds are moving forward, and perhaps they're offering a bit more in those wide areas, the visitors.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.48am BST</p>
      <p>39 min: It's a very defence-minded back six from Kevin Muscat with no recognised fullbacks. Centre back Thomas Deng is preferred to youngster Stefan Nigro on the right, while veteran utility Broxham patrols the left back position.</p>
      <p>And now it's Rhys Williams in the book for a trademark Championship storm-and-thunder tackle from behind on Diawara. He doesn't mind those, old Rhys.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.45am BST</p>
      <p>35 min: Victory enjoying a decent spell of possession, but the Adelaide defence standing up well to the examination so far. Barbarouses looks the one most likely to spark something with Troisi and Besart Berisha largely peripheral. For now.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.40am BST</p>
      <p>31 min: Elimination final 1 winning coach Warren Joyce is in the stands tonight. More of a psyche power move, no? Given his City side won't face either of these two unless both progress past Newcastle Jets and Sydney FC respectively.</p>
      <p>And terrific defending from Garuccio! A fast break, and it's George almost through one-on-one. The Reds left back slides in. He had to be so careful, having already been booked, but he connects cleanly in the box!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.36am BST</p>
      <p>28 min: Slightly more end-to-end now, as Adelaide enjoy a good chance from a corner. Excellent delivery from Absalonsen who gets Thomas coming for it, but he doesn't connect with the punch, and Konstandopoulos tries to chest control at the far post but can't direct it goalwards!</p>
      <p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 9.36am BST</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.33am BST</p>
      <p>24 min: First caution of the game, as Ben Garuccio bodychecks Barbarouses. He'll have to watch out, the Adelaide fullback, they've got plenty of pace on the flanks, do Victory.</p>
      <p>George whips in the freekick and it's the unlikely figure of Barbarouses on the end of it. Not a prolific headed goalscorer, and it's safely controlled once more.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.30am BST</p>
      <p>21 min: Baba Diawara goes to ground under a tackle from Leigh Broxham - there appeared to be sturdy contact, but nothing given. Up the other end Isaias is now penalised for a late challenge on James Troisi.</p>
      <p>What can Victory do with this freekick?</p>
      <p>It's wide, just outside the Adelaide box. Antonis strikes it - but it's comfortably held by Paul Izzo.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.26am BST</p>
      <p>18 min: Not surprisingly it's been a tense, and perhaps intense, start to this one. Marco Kurz has built a team that works very hard out of possession and the Reds are really scrapping when Victory have the ball and vice-versa from Kevin Muscat's side.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.22am BST</p>
      <p>13 min: Victory beginning to enjoy a slight shade of the possession, but there have been no clear cut chances, outside that early freekick to Adelaide. Mileusnic goes to ground looking for a foul by Carl Valeri but nothing forthcoming.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.19am BST</p>
      <p>9 min: This time it's Adelaide with the lightning transition. Lawrence Thomas very relieved as his clearance clatters into the speedy Nikolai Mileusnic but it trickles behind for a corner.</p>
      <p>Ersum Gulum gets a head to it..! But it flashes wide.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.15am BST</p>
      <p>5 min: There's just under 20,000 expected at AAMI Park tonight and already there's a decent atmosphere. Antonis conceeds a second foul, but in a less dangerous area.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kosta Barbarouses breaks away in transition and earns the Victory a corner. Leroy George plays short, but the defence is alive to it. Johan Absalonsen clears for Adelaide.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.12am BST</p>
      <p>Full-time: Cronulla Sharks 26-22 Penrith Panthers</p>
      <p>And there's been a late charge from the Panthers, but they've not been able to turn it around. A great win for the Sharks - they weathered a stack of pressure late in the first half, but they've made it count in the second. Disappointment for Penrith, who slip to just their second loss of the season.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.10am BST</p>
      <p>2 min: And an early scare for the Victory! Terry Antonis catch young Red Nathan Konstandopoulos just outside the box to concede a dangerous free-kick opportunity.</p>
      <p>Isaias and Daniel Adlung - both hand from the dead ball - standing over it, but the wall deflects behind. Danger averted.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.07am BST</p>
      <p>Kick-off! Melbourne Victory v Adelaide United</p>
      <p>Okay, we'll wrap our other live games where we can, but let's move our attention to this - the big one - the A-League elimination final.</p>
      <p>Adelaide's captain Isaias returns to boost the Reds' midfield, while Kevin Muscat names an as expected lineup:</p>
      <p>enltrICYMI! Here's how we line up for #MVCvADL #MVFC pic.twitter.com/IV4dj6a2PA</p>

      <p>And here's the visiting team:</p>

      <p>- Adelaide United FC (@AdelaideUnited) April 22, 2018</p>
      <p>And there's the whistle from referee Chris Beath, and we're underway from AAMI Park in Melbourne!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 9.02am BST</p>
      <p>Full-time: North Melbourne 14.14 (98) defeat Hawthorn 11.4 (70)</p>
      <p>Relief for home fans - the Hawks really threatened to come knocking during that third quarter but their young Roos side has dug deep to hang on to a memorable win, and a rare one against Hawthorn!</p>
      <p>The margin comfortable in the end, but a wobble there that made it very lively late in the second half.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.58am BST</p>
      <p>Full-time: Brumbies 20-25 Jaguares</p>
      <p>Deary me. The Brumbies have really blown a chance to make a move in the Australian conference after both the Waratahs and Reds were handed heavy home losses, and the Rebels were done on the road in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Henry Speight's 100th Super Rugby match overshadowed by the 0-4 weekend for Australian rugby, as the Jaguares win their second match on the bounce on Australian soil.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.55am BST</p>
      <p>And over in the NRL it's a second try to Cronulla's Jesse Ramien, and they should just be good enough, the Sharks, to see this one home!</p>
      <p>They lead 24-12 with ten to play and it would take something VERY special from here for the Panthers to maintain their blistering start to this season.</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.52am BST</p>
      <p>It's a 21-point margin in the Roos-Hawks AFL match, but North Melbourne are lining up with Zurhaar with just over ten to play.</p>
      <p>We've had five scoring opportunities in this final quarter and they've missed four, with only Jack Gunston kicking a major.</p>
      <p>Big pressure on the 19-year-old - he's only got a handful of goals in his entire AFL career, but he's got it, he's kicked straight and true, and the Roos move to 27 clear!</p>
      <p>block-time published-time 8.39am BST</p>
      <p>So a quick whizz round the grounds, because we're not too far away from adding the big one - the A-League second elimination final - to this "all the sports, all the time" rolling report.</p>
      <p>In the super rugby, it's really bubbling nicely as the Brumbies trail the Jaguares 17-20 with about fifteen minutes to play.</p>
      <p>To the NRL, where Penrith have just crossed to bring it back to 18-10 (conversion to come) against the Sharks.</p>
      <p>And in the AFL it's Gold Coast by four, 4.3 (27) plays 3.5 (23) for the Lions, and it's 12.11 (83) plays 9.4 (58) as the Hawthorn squander two consecutive shooting chances to continue their second-half resurgence against North Melbourne!</p>
      <p>So much happening, and a tough shout as to which of these is currently the most engrossing. Sports!</p>

      <p>Three-quarter-time: North Melbourne 12.11 (83) lead Hawthorn 9.2 (56)</p>
      <p>Goodness me! We've had six goals to one in this third quarter; did we read the rites for the Hawks too early?!</p>
      <p>Not sure if Clarkson went for the 'double hairdryer' at HT but Liam Shiels came out and kicked two as Hawthorn went three straight to start the quarter. A steadier from Trent Dumont gave some nervous North fans a breather, but a double to Luke Breust and and a major to Isaac Smith has the Hawks roaring home.</p>
      <p>They trailed 75-18 at half-time don't forget, but they've brought this one back to just 27 points! Remarkable, and what a quarter we have in store here.</p>

      <p>Quarter-time: Brisbane Lions 2.3 (15) trail Gold Coast Suns 4.2 (26)</p>
      <p>It's first blood Suns in the AFL's "Queensland derby", who finished the quarter progressively stronger after the home side opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>Lewis Taylor and Zac Bailey the men to give home fans something approaching hope not sadness, but a double to Darcy MacPherson and goals to Tom Lynch and Brayden Fiorini gives the Suns a slight advantage. Plenty more to come here.</p>

      <p>Half-time: Cronulla Sharks 10-6 Penrith Panther</p>
      <p>Now isn't this an interesting contest; just as the Panthers looked to be building ascendency it's the Sharks who have hit back.</p>
      <p>Penrith have enjoyed nearly 60% possession and at times were really hammering the Cronulla tryline, but a try to Scott Sorensen with 28 minutes gone - converted by his brother-in-law Chad Townsend (fun fact) gives the home side the lead. Nice moment for Sorensen, he's gone something like three years since his last NRL game, and his teammates gave him a big cuddle when he went over. Lovely.</p>

      <p>Half-time: Brumbies 10-13 Jaguares</p>
      <p>Better viewing here if you're a Brumbies fan, with two late tries to fullback Tom Banks giving the home side a bit of momentum just before the break.</p>
      <p>It's been a typically aggressive start from the Argentinians who have almost bullied the Brumbies. Captain David Pocock has come more into the contest as the half has progressed however, and if not for some conversion misses the Australians could have gone in ahead. Nicely poised here in Canberra therefore.</p>

      <p>Try! Cronulla Sharks 4-6 Penrith Panthers</p>
      <p>Well, they weathered an early storm, did Penrith, but they momentum has definitely swung the way of the side currently boasting five wins from six, especially after the key involvement of another former Panther, this time with the loss of Luke Lewis to injury for the Sharks.</p>
      <p>Dallin Watene-Zelezniak making the most of some fine work by Dean Whare as the Panthers hit the lead. A disallowed try let off for them as well, so the Bunker rightly making it one a piece on that front.</p>

      <p>Wowee. Alastair Clarkson gave his side an absolute revving at quarter-time, and when a Roos error allowed Jarman Impey to kick the first of the quarter for the Hawks inside 70 seconds it looked like we could have a contest back on our hands.</p>
      <p>But we've had eight consecutive and unanswered scoring efforts from North, to see the Roos pick up where they left off - Shaun Atley, Billy Hartung, a fourth to Brown and a second to Waite doing the damage.</p>
      <p>This is turning into a shellacking, in utter keeping with the topsy-turvy start we've seen to this 2018 AFL season!</p>

      <p>A try after just four minutes to Matias Orlando but it's been the Nicolas Sanchez show early on. It was his bust that led to the try, and the fly-half has added the extras with a successful conversion and two penalties as well.</p>

      <p>They've started brightly here the home side, and it's the Sharks who draw first blood (arf arf) as Valentine Holmes crosses with just five minutes gone! No extras from the sideline.</p>
      <p>And a big video ref examination denies a second try - a one-on-one strip attempt in-goal from former Panthers fullback Matty Moylan almost makes it potentially 10-0, but The Bunker adjudicates it a knock on.</p>

      <p>And that's that! They got absolutely pantsed in Round 2 by the Sea Eagles, but after a week of soul searching and some shake ups at the club the Eels look a very different prospect after this.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the Sea Eagles could now be in all sorts. Stories of player ill-discipline of their own behind the scenes are evidently not helping; a big few weeks ahead for Trent Barrett and his staff.</p>

      <p>He strikes you as a popular lad (relative to Jackson Hastings at least) and once again it's Moses who was instrumental.</p>
      <p>This is turning into a tale of two footy clubs here; maybe Manly can ask the Parra boys what went down this week and see if they can try and replicate it?</p>

      <p>A sixth try, and a sixth different tryscorer, they're carving the Sea Eagles open at will. For the very slightest of seconds it looked like Manly was about to arrest this one-way event as Brad Parker registered their first points, but a simple backline move and over strolls Kenny Edwards for the Eels. It's turning into a procession.</p>

      <p>Michael Jennings gets in on the brothers' act as he reels in a smart chip kick from Moses. This could get very ugly for the Eagles, who with the Cowboys and now the Eels (presumably) wining might start to get very nervous about become NRL 2018's whipping boys.</p>

      <p>Well, he's carved through the Sea Eagles defence like a hot knife through butter there. Nothing complex, he received, he ran, he saw half a gap and he made it count.</p>

      <p>They've called it back for obstruction, but two Eels defenders still missed their tackles, and it's questionable whether the third (who was adjudged to have been impeded) could have got there anyway!</p>

      <p>The only concern you'd have if you're Brad Arthur so far is that they haven't made this dominance count on the scoreboard.</p>
      <p>Tell you what I'd love to see today though. A bit of Jarryd 'pre-travels' Hayne razzle dazzle on the wing for the Eels.</p>

      <title>Review: ARTS: The elite debacle: Set in modern Mayfair and Canary Wharf, with the ruling class in disarray, the National Theatre's new Timon of Athens shows the meltdown of the British establishment, writes Newsnight's economics editor Paul Mason</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>As he damns the Athenian elite, Timon exhorts: "Bound servants, steal! Large-handed robbers your grave masters are, and pill by law." By this time, in Nicholas Hytner's new production of Timon of Athens at the National Theatre, the bound servants need no encouragement: they are encamped in small tents outside mansions, swathed in hoodies and masked-up. They prowl at the edges of the action, haunting the cast of bankers, celebrities and politicians who make up Timon's world. The details are haunting: the skyline of Canary Wharf; the effete goodie bags from London Fashion Week that hang from the wrists of Timon's entourage; the flimsy, Westminster guest pass worn by Timon's emissary to the Senators, whose own official lanyards convey instant superiority.</p>
      <p>Hytner has staged Timon not just as an episode in the financial crisis: this is a meltdown of the British establishment played out in full view of the Occupy camp; Timon's women strut and preen in couture that Kate and Pippa might wear; his protege, Ventidius, comes out with the same posh rubbish you might hear from gilded youth in Chelsea; Timon himself is the liberal aesthete-millionaire, dispensing patronage to the arts and short shrift to his accountants. Until things fall apart.</p>
      <p>So now, at the very moment that Leveson, Chilcott and the Tyrie committee are crawling over the reputations of those in power, the National Theatre's corporate sponsors - which include Goldman, JP Morgan and Accenture - get to watch it all played out as Jacobean drama, and from the best seats in the house.</p>
      <p>For Timon of Athens is not primarily about money. Marx got it right when he wrote that the play was about the "power of money". Money, for Timon, is the means of creating and lubricating a power network. He springs Ventidius out of jail with five grand, secures a marriage for his servant with 20, responds to a gift of greyhounds from a powerful contact with "fair reward".</p>
      <p>When he goes bust, all he asks for are loans of ready money - liquidity, in banking parlance. But neither the senator, nor the toff, nor the Hooray Henry he has bailed out in the past are prepared to stump up. Neither is the state.</p>
      <p>Timon - like Lehman Brothers - goes bust because of what appears as a liquidity crisis. But, as with Lehman, this masks a deeper collapse. Once Timon can no longer supply his social network with gallery openings, soft-porn ballet and massive overpayments for menial services, his social value is zero. Which makes the play's revival as a satire on London in 2012 all the more relevant. Shakespeare had grasped something about the crisis of his time that some politicians and economists are still not prepared to confront about ours.</p>
      <p>In the week before Hytner's Timon opened on 10 July, Barclays lost its chairman, then its chief executive, then reinstated its chairman. It launched a PR fightback that, by accident or design, dragged the Bank of England and figures close to Gordon Brown into the line of fire, to face questions about who had leant on whom to rig Libor. The Bank of England's deputy governor duly shot down this line of inquiry, in testimony to MPs - saying that no politician had pressured him, nor had he pressured Barclays. But by now the Libor scandal had produced divisions between bankers and politicians.</p>
      <p>Barclays had narrowly escaped part-nationalisation in 2008. In 2009, Bob Diamond managed to move a huge chunk of bad debt off the balance sheet to the Cayman Islands; Alistair Darling's tax cuts revived growth; the system was stable once again. By 2011, Barclays was leading the line for the industry to negotiate Project Merlin: a scheme to increase bank lending to business in return for the removal of the cap on bonuses. Barclays had been given the benefit of the doubt by politicians - re-admitted to the fold.</p>
      <p>Then came the revelation that it had manipulated Libor - for the personal gain of traders between 2005-7, and for survival reasons in 2008. The slap-on-the-wrist deal it had agreed with regulators now unravelled in the face of public anger. For a few panicked days, each part of the establishment was engaged in finger-pointing at the rest. Suddenly the social standing of Barclays' bosses had - as with Timon - become diminished.</p>
      <p>It was just the latest event in what has - since the summer of 2011 - become a "social meltdown", with the contagion just as virulent as in the economic meltdown of late 2008.</p>
      <p>Police testimony at Leveson speaks of "a network of corrupted individuals". Criminal charges have been laid against newspaper journalists and editors. Companies charged with security at the Olympics have failed to deliver; companies charged with getting the workless into work likewise.</p>
      <p>But there are crucial differences between Timon's Athens and the London of 2012: there is a powerful mob in Shakespeare's play, with a capable leader - Alcibiades. In the end, this leader conquers the city, is absorbed into the ruling group and, with Timon dead, society is healed. Today - in London and across Europe - it's impossible to predict a happy ending, because the nature of the "mob" has changed.</p>
      <p>When Timon, in the wilderness, encounters Alcibiades's troops - whom Hytner supplies with baseball bats and Molotovs - he uses gold to corrupt their revolt. He urges the men to "mince" the children of Athens and the whores among them to "infect" Athenian men. They, in turn, reply frankly: "We'll do anything for gold." They surge off, behind Alcebiades, who duly triumphs.</p>
      <p>But what characterised the revolts that have kicked off since 2008 is their hostility to leadership, and the willingness to abandon an action should it lead in the direction of hierarchy, power-games or engagement with mainstream structures. Likewise, the English riots of 2011: ultra-violent, refusing - on the evidence of the Guardian/LSE study - to be pigeonholed as revolts against policing, racism and poverty. They were multifaceted, non-ideological and largely leaderless. Hytner's mob might wear hoodies, sleep in the pop-up tents of the indignado camp, but they are textually obliged to behave as a 17th-century mob - trailing gormlessly behind the man they will put in power. The contrast between this and the real modern crowd - armed with Blackberries and Flickr streams - is telling.</p>
      <p>What it means for the modern elite in crisis is that there is no ready supply of untarnished men and women from outside the mainstream to come and save the situtation. We've seen this most graphically in Greece, where the establishment parties declined, with fascism and the far left making giant strides. But it's a feature of many of the crisis-ridden countries: the disengagement of the young and rebellious from power itself.</p>
      <p>Timon is - as everybody who has read the pass notes understands - a "difficult" play". It is effectively a Jacobean "city comedy" by Thomas Middleton wrapped in a character study by Shakespeare: a theatrical "shit sandwich" to go with the real ones that Timon serves to his creditors at the moment of revenge.</p>
      <p>The play is a product of a disrupted time: Elizabeth dead, James crowned, the die cast for 50 years of religious and social conflict, London suddenly swarmed with alien Scottish capitalists on the make. The Earl of Essex's rebellion had recently subjected the city to mob rule, plague had closed its theatres, and Guido Fawkes had just been executed for trying to blow up parliament. It was a society that felt, for different reasons, as fragile as ours. It feared breakdown - not yet because of cohesive mass unrest: this would come in the 1630s and erupt into civil war in 1642. The fragility of Jacobean England lay in the fear that the elite was doomed, fragmented, at odds with culture and society.</p>
      <p>It is in this that Timon of Athens loses its "difficulty" and becomes a parable for the crisis of the modern business elite. "There are only two stories," the journalist Murray Sayle once said: "'We name the guilty man', and 'Arrow points to defective part.'" The rest, he implied, was worthy rubbish. For the past four years, those who've tried to explain the financial crisis have tended to adopt this doctrine: looking for guilty bankers or defective parts in an otherwise functional system.</p>
      <p>Last year, Ewald Engelen and a team of economists based at Manchester University proposed a third explanation: the "elite debacle". This they define as a non-reversible, major, complex event that feels more like a catastrophic military defeat. For Engelen it is not bankers but the politicians, regulators and their world view that are the focus of criticism. Their trademark has been hubris: "The over-confident are attracted to leadership," Engelen observes "and once in command . . . they are encouraged to concentrate on big-picture 'strategy', leaving tedious evidence and detail to subordinate technicians."</p>
      <p>Timon's downfall begins from just this: he refuses to see the accounts that his steward has prepared because what's in them - insolvency - would call a halt to his life of philanthropy and power. But the play becomes an elite debacle only once the Athenian ruling caste abandons Timon. They enforce the laws of commerce against the unwritten obligations of the power network. He, in turn, serves them covered plates of "filth", hurls it into their faces, and as they flee into the troubled streets the mob joins in, showering the rich with faeces.</p>
      <p>In Hytner's staging, Timon of Athens becomes not difficult but crystal clear: indeed, one suspects the play was only "difficult" in times of stability, certainty and upward mobility. But these are gone. For four years, the central bankers, regulators and politicians have risen to the post-Lehman crisis collectively: they've socialised losses, written off debts, injected liquidity, and printed money when there was no more left to lend. They enforced the principle of collectivity that Timon himself appeals to in the play: "O, what a precious comfort 'tis to have so many like brothers and sisters commanding one another's fortunes."</p>
      <p>This collectivity at the top is what, up to now, prevented the financial crisis from eating through into the social and political fabric. Now popular anger has broken apart the elites collectivity. From now on, the politicians will run as fast from the tainted bankers as they do from the newspaper editors who formerly showered them with good headlines. And there may be more to come: a Barclays' internal memo that predicts its own reputational collapse will look puny once the regulators are done with others in the frame.</p>
      <p>Bernard Shaw once wrote of Shakespeare's tranche of "problem" plays that the dramatist looked ready to start on the 20th century if only the 17th century would get out of his way. But Timon is relevant to all centuries in which formerly stable elites collapse - and ours is beginning to look like one of them. So roll up for Shakespeare's least-performed play. It's half by somebody else, and the hero disappears before the end. But the elite debacle is the only show in town.</p>

      <title>Comment &amp; Debate: The jinx of the north: Clinton and Obama are doomed to failure in a presidential race, for they are not from the south</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>As an American who yields to none in her loathing of the incumbent president, I am frequently invited to enthuse over the presumptive 2008 Democratic contenders. But I'm unconvinced that either Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama is electable. Perhaps it's time to consider the dark horse.</p>
      <p>US papers report that John Edwards has gone on the attack; one of his advisers just opined that a Clinton nomination would lose blue states. A recent poll agreed: more than half of Americans would never vote for Clinton, which shouldn't surprise anyone who remembers the first Clinton presidency. Obama presents a similar problem. I'm a fan, and from his home state, but I don't think he can win the presidency yet. Moreover, the dark horse has an overlooked advantage, and given that none of the nominees has offered anything so divisive as actual ideas to help us choose among them, Democratic strategists might consider Edwards for one reason alone: history.</p>
      <p>The election of the first Republican president, in 1860, precipitated the US civil war. His name was Abraham Lincoln, and his new party represented the urban north, federalism, and abolition. The party of the rural south, the Democrats, supported agrarianism, states' rights, and slavery. After Lincoln's election, southern Democrats seceded from the union, formed the Confederate States of America, and declared war on Republicans.</p>
      <p>The entire south - the 11 confederate states plus five border states - voted as a block for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election for the next 60 years. There were only two, quite extraordinary, exceptions: the election of 1872, in which the Democratic candidate actually died between the popular and the electoral vote - and six southern states still chose a dead man over a Republican; and the election of 1928, when a Roman Catholic, pro-immigration, pro-civil rights, anti-prohibition New Yorker proved too much for the south - although once again six intransigent holdouts still voted Democrat.</p>
      <p>In 1948 everything changed. Harry S Truman, a southern Democrat, endorsed a strong civil rights platform. The deep south nearly seceded again, as four "Dixiecrat" states followed white supremacist Strom Thurmond. Truman won the rest of the south, but civil rights proved the deal-breaker. The Democrats had always represented the workers, and the Republicans big business (plus ca change). The rural southern working man had two traditional claims to power: gender and race. He may have been white trash, but by God he was superior to women and "negroes". As the Democratic platform liberalised, the conservative south began turning Republican, and electoral maps of ensuing elections show the subsequent contest for the south in the 14 presidential elections since 1948.</p>
      <p>The neglected fact is this: with one notable exception (see below), since the 1944 election of Franklin D Roosevelt, no Democratic president has come from a northern state. Not for 60 years - the exact same amount of time that the solid south voted for Democrats. Since Roosevelt, all the Democratic presidents but one were southern: Truman, Johnson, Carter and Clinton. Conversely, the list of failed Democratic presidential candidates from the north since Truman is a catalogue of humiliating routs: Stevenson, Humphrey, McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, and Kerry - the most successful.</p>
      <p>As Gore proved, being from the south is not sufficient for a Democrat to win the presidency. Or even his own state. But for 60 years, being from the south has been necessary. The only exception - John F Kennedy - had two significant edges. First, running mate Lyndon Johnson, an enormously popular old Texan campaigner who successfully lobbied much of the south. Second, alleged voter fraud in Illinois and Texas. Even assuming the 1960 election win was legitimate, it was by the smallest margin in the 20th century: a mere 113,000 votes separated Kennedy and Nixon among 68 million ballots. By comparison, Gore's 500,000-vote margin among 100 million ballots resembles a landslide.</p>
      <p>Is George Bush's current unpopularity sufficient to goad the deep south into voting for northerners like Clinton or Obama? Hard to imagine. In theory a Democrat could win the election without carrying the south. But here's another forgotten fact: no Democrat since the civil war who lost more than half the southern states has become president.</p>
      <p>If the Democrats want to win, they need to think hard about nominating someone from the south. It won't guarantee them the election, but if they nominate another northerner I fear they can kiss the White House goodbye for another four years - and the rest of the world can weep into its history books.</p>

      <title>Football: Champions League: Real Madrid v Manchester United: How a defeat by Madrid changed Ferguson's Euro mindset for ever: Rob Smyth recalls the traumatic exit in 2000 that ushered in an era of caution</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson does not readily admit mistakes. Poor signings are bundled discreetly out of the back door, the subject rarely up for discussion, and critics are routinely taken apart by a genuine master of rhetoric. So when he does admit to a mistake, it is reasonable to assume it is a biggie: the sale of Jaap Stam, the announcement of his plan to retire in 2002 - and his tactics against Real Madrid in 2000.</p>
      <p>It was one of the most important games in modern Manchester United history. Not only did it irrevocably damage their hopes of a European dynasty; it led to the most significant philosophical change in the history of the club. Before that game Ferguson sent his teams out in Europe to score one more than the opposition; since then, for the most part, he has sent them out to concede one fewer. Now, ahead of another meeting with Madrid, he may have come full circle.</p>
      <p>After 26 years one would think English football knows everything about Ferguson, yet despite regular reminders, such as the expert muzzling of Everton's Marouane Fellaini on Sunday, his position as one of the game's keenest tacticians remains strangely unrecognised. Ferguson is sometimes patronised as somebody armed with a hairdryer and a chequebook, his success largely down to his genius for man-management and motivation, yet he has always been something of a chalkboard addict.</p>
      <p>However, in 1999-2000, United, empowered by the previous season's treble, seemed to have an omnipotence that rendered tactics almost irrelevant. Everyone knew the best front six: David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Ryan Giggs, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole. Then, in the quarter-finals, an unusually tame 0-0 draw at the Bernabeu was followed by a traumatic 3-2 defeat at home. The received wisdom is that Madrid had too much class and street wisdom for United in that second leg, best exemplified by Fernando Redondo's backheeled nutmeg on Henning Berg that led to the third goal, yet the tape shows that United were pretty unfortunate to lose an excellent game of football between two excellent teams.</p>
      <p>Ferguson decided United lost because he was too slow to react to Madrid's unprecedented 3-3-2-2 formation, with Redondo the only central midfielder. "If I had altered the team early to a 4-3-3 . . . I am sure we could have won handily," he said in his autobiography. "I know that, and could kick myself for delaying the change." The Real manager Vicente del Bosque, did it for him, referring witheringly to United's "tactical anarchy". Ferguson ensured nobody would make such accusations ever again.</p>
      <p>Eighteen months earlier he had described a 3-3 draw with Barcelona as "the perfect football match - both teams trying to win with scant regard for the consequences. That's how football should be played." Now he saw the world through different eyes. "One of the forceful reminders delivered by that Madrid defeat was that consistent success in Europe would be more readily achieved if we improved our capacity to defend against the counterattack," he said. The most obvious way to do that is to ration your own attacks.</p>
      <p>Since then United have been a different side in Europe and in big games domestically: whereas once they were swashbuckling and intrepid to the point of naivety, now they are worldly, cautious and always look under the sauce to see if it really is pasta. The change was intensified when Carlos Queiroz, a defensive influence for richer and poorer, joined as assistant manager in 2002.</p>
      <p>The new approach took a long time to be successful: United could not even win multiple Champions League knockout ties, never mind multiple Champions Leagues, with only one victory between 2000 and 2006 inclusive. Some feel Ferguson had ultimate vindication with Champions League victory in 2008 and a run of three finals in four years; others say the potential of the treble team was not fulfilled because they played in a manner that was alien to them.</p>
      <p>The first significant change came with the signing of Juan Sebastian Veron in 2001. He was in the side the last time Ferguson named an unchanged team from one European match to the next - more than 11 years ago, against Deportivo La Coruna. The extent to which Ferguson tinkers is perhaps best summed up by the XI for the final against Chelsea in 2008. It was the only time that team ever started together, a bespoke solution for a Champions League final. Owen Hargreaves was on the right-hand side of midfield in a loose 4-4-2 so that, if Chelsea's midfield got on top, he could tuck into the centre with Wayne Rooney moving to right wing. That is precisely what happened. Rooney has probably been the most important counter on Ferguson's tactics board, such is his selfless flexibility. In semi-finals and finals of the Champions League alone he has played left-wing, right-wing, in the hole and up front.</p>
      <p>To Ferguson, the squareness of a peg and the roundness of a hole are in the eye of the beholder. Players are frequently used away from their regular position. Ronaldo often played as a centre-forward, for example. Ferguson takes pride in telling the media they have no chance of predicting his team - between 2008 and 2011 he went 166 games in all competitions without naming an unchanged side - and he has no compunction about going against expectation or upsetting people. The £30.75m Dimitar Berbatov started only five of 18 knockout games and did not even make the bench for the 2011 final.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has never been afraid to change his mind. Park Ji-sung started zero European games in his first two seasons at Old Trafford; over the next five years he became a vital player, trusted implicitly because of his tactical discipline. He was regularly used to sit on full-backs such as Dani Alves and Maicon.</p>
      <p>It was not Park but the parking of the bus that drew most attention after Ferguson's most controversial selection, against Barcelona in the 2008 semi-final. Barcelona were unravelling towards the end of Frank Rijkaard's reign, yet United's ostensibly attacking 4-2-3-1 in the first leg at Camp Nou soon morphed into 9-0-1. They had 28% possession in that game and only three shots on target in the entire tie but went through 1-0 on aggregate after a stunning goal from Scholes. The debate endures as to whether such an approach was acceptable. "For the obvious reasons like reaching the final - yes," says John Paul O'Neill, a contributor to Red Issue. "For the embarrassing tactical approach in the away leg - not at all. It was a betrayal of everything United are supposed to represent, especially in Europe."</p>
      <p>United were similarly cautious on their last two trips to Madrid, without the same success. Both times they travelled during winning runs in the league - 11 in 2000, 10 in 2003 - yet played meekly. The teenage Ferguson had been seduced by Real's legendary 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden Park in 1960, a match he said "epitomised all the dreams of European football", and it almost felt as if he had sent his team out to face Puskas, Di Stefano and Gento. This time United are on a run of 38 points in 14 league games.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has recently admitted another mistake, that United were too negative in the title-deciding Manchester derby last April. That miserable performance may have stung him into change just as the Madrid game did all those years ago. A greater emphasis on attacking meant the signing of Robin van Persie and a more positive approach in big games this season, albeit with controlled rather than reckless aggression, that was particularly successful in 3-2 victories at Stamford Bridge and Eastlands. He has also played around with a diamond midfield in some European games.</p>
      <p>"It's hard to predict whether he will go for it in Madrid," says O'Neill. "On occasions this season it has seemed like Fergie's rediscovered his cojones when it comes to picking an offensive line-up in big games. We'll find out for sure in Madrid." One thing is already sure: Ferguson will have a plan. He always does.</p>

      <title>G2: Law: Lifting the veil: We may soon be allowed to find out how jurors deliberate, and judges may try the most complex fraud cases without juries. In a rare interview, Lord Justice Auld talks to Clare Dyer about the future for juries</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A chink could soon be opened in the impenetrable curtain that for centuries has shrouded the English legal system's most secret institution. The government - assuming Labour is re-elected this week - is poised to allow researchers into the English jury room for the first time.</p>
      <p>English jurors' deliberations have been sacrosanct for hundreds of years. No one knows how the 12 men and women who hold an accused's fate in their hands reach the decision to convict or acquit. No OJ Simpson-style jury debriefings reach our TV screens, and in 1992 the Mail on Sunday was fined £75,000 for contempt of court for publishing interviews with jurors in the Blue Arrow fraud case about how they reached their verdicts.</p>
      <p>No change is likely on the media front. But the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, is proposing to authorise academics, with the lord chief justice's consent, and under strictly controlled conditions yet to be spelled out, to carry out research into what goes on when the jury is deliberating. Jurors' anonymity would be preserved but the possibility of video cameras to record their discussions has not been ruled out.</p>
      <p>The proposal, spelled out in a consultation paper last January, is ringing predictable alarm bells among those who suspect the government of less than total commitment to trial by jury. Last month, after the spectacular collapse of the 21-month, £60m Jubilee line fraud trial, ministers announced that they would go ahead with proposals for judge-alone trials in the most complex fraud cases. The change is already enshrined in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, pushed through at the last minute in a game of parliamentary ping-pong after a bitter fight with the House of Lords which nearly scuppered the entire act.</p>
      <p>As a result of a last-minute deal, another battle looms before it can finally be brought into effect: there will have to be a vote of both Houses of Parliament. Many lawyers oppose the move, arguing that every fraud case, however complicated, boils down to deciding whether the accused had a dishonest motive, a question 12 jurors are at least as well equipped as anyone to answer. Those who support the change say involving a jury stretches the length of a case and puts intolerable burdens on jurors and defendants. Opponents maintain that firm case management and good prosecution presentation can reduce even the most complicated case to a length the jury can cope with. Supporters say that with the increasing complexity of fraud, the insistence on jury trial means that some cases cannot be prosecuted at all.</p>
      <p>Could jury research give new ammunition to the advocates of judge-alone trials for the most difficult cases? Would the research show - as did a large-scale study in New Zealand - that juries do have difficulty with the concept of intent and whether a defendant acted dishonestly? Or would it confirm research findings from Middlesex University - which, of course, could not question jurors about their deliberations - that more than half the jurors did not fully comprehend what was going on in the trial?</p>
      <p>The 800-year-old right to be tried by a jury of one's peers is seen by many as a hallowed pillar of the English legal system, and any encroachment on it arouses strong feelings. Five years ago, Labour twice failed to curb the right of defendants charged with middle-ranking "either-way" offences such as theft to opt to be tried by judge and jury rather than magistrates.</p>
      <p>Hardly less controversial has been the suggestion that juries should be dispensed with in the most complex, lengthy fraud trials. The proposal dates back to a recommendation nearly 20 years ago by the Roskill Fraud Trials Committee. It surfaced again in 2001, in a wide-ranging review, commissioned by the government, of the workings of the criminal courts by the appeal court judge Sir Robin Auld. He proposed that in the most complex fraud cases, the trial judge could decide in the interests of justice to try the case without a jury. This time the government picked it up and ran with it, putting it in a white paper and then the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>
      <p>Despite the outcry from lawyers and civil liberties groups, Auld remains unrepentant. In his first interview since he launched his report nearly four years ago, he recalls: "There was a core of recommendations, 10 or 15 about jury trials that I knew, because the battles had been fought on Roskill and also on Runciman (the 1993 royal commission on criminal justice), would be controversial. At the end I just couldn't put my name to the report without saying what I thought should happen."</p>
      <p>On one wall in his large room at the Royal Courts of Justice in London is the board that once hung outside the chambers where he practised as a barrister before going on the bench. I notice the name of Michael Howard (yes, that Michael Howard), along with those of Ann Mallalieu, his first pupil and now a Labour peer, and, at the top, the former Labour lord chancellor Elwyn Jones. "I have no political allegiance," Auld says. "I think I've voted for every party in my time."</p>
      <p>He was, he thinks, "slightly naive" at the beginning of his review, which became "a bit pressured as the political aspects became evident". Labour was preparing proposals for reforming the criminal justice system and showed him a draft paper a few days before publication "crediting me with all sorts of recommendations which I had not then made or even indicated I was going to make. I made them change the draft several times."</p>
      <p>He argued that there should be a power to try other complex cases, not just fraud, without juries, a recommendation certain to meet with stiff opposition if ministers ever try to introduce it. "I said as a first step, let's do this for complex fraud and if it works, consideration should be given to extending it to other cases where the same problem arises. There are not necessarily very many of them. It may be that the expedient way to go about it is little by little, not with a view to removing juries where you can usefully work with them but doing so where, whatever the case, you can't."</p>
      <p>Most of his recommendations on reform of the courts and criminal procedures have been implemented, although the government is unlikely to take up some of his more controversial jury proposals, such as requiring juries in appropriate cases to give reasons for their verdicts, and allowing appeals against perverse verdicts by juries.</p>
      <p>Auld, who travelled to the US and looked at a mass of research from other countries during his review, lines up with the traditionalists in opposing intrusive research into juries. Not because he fears it might show up flaws in the system and damage public confidence in it, but because he feels existing research on English juries which stops short of the jury room, and research on jury deliberations elsewhere, particularly in New Zealand, tell us all we need to know. "To go further than has already been done would require intrusive research which could induce all sorts of elements of unease in individual cases about the validity of verdicts while research was underway."</p>
      <p>Along with jury research, the government is also consulting on what to do in cases where allegations are raised after a conviction that jurors were racially biased or acted improperly in some other way during their deliberations. In several appeals, because of the rule protecting the secrets of the jury room, the courts have refused to look into allegations made by whistleblowing jurors against their fellows. In a recent test case, the House of Lords, by a four-one majority, upheld that stance, citing the need for finality of verdicts and the danger of undermining public confidence in the jury system.</p>
      <p>The consultation paper - contrary to Auld's recommendation that judges should be able to probe such allegations - proposes to preserve the status quo, despite the question reasonably posed by Lord Steyn, the dissenting law lord, in his judgment: "In cases where there is cogent evidence demonstrating a real risk that the jury was not impartial and that the general confidence in jury verdicts was in the particular case ill reposed, what possible public interest can there be in maintaining a dubious conviction?"</p>
      <p>Auld agrees: "I don't know why the government has taken that approach. It may be that this is one where the lawyers' instincts and traditions hold sway. It would have to be an exceptional case. You couldn't have an appellate court involved if there was a mere suggestion of jury impropriety, but I don't see why if there were some arguable grounds for intervening the matter shouldn't be looked at.</p>
      <p>"It seems to me vital that if we're concerned about the integrity of the system and the safety of verdicts, if there is any suggestion of jury impropriety which looks worthy of investigation, a judge at trial or the Court of Appeal should be entitled to look at it. What objection can there be to a court examining whether the system has been tainted in some way by a juror's comment, perhaps demonstrating bias or a wholly irrational approach to the case, in the jury room, or outside the jury room in the course of a trial?"</p>

      <title>Education: The profile: Down to business: Trevor Averre-Beeson is the super-head who turned around the comprehensive the Blairs rejected. Now he's been hired - by a private firm - to tackle another ailing school</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>I walk into Trevor Averre-Beeson's awesomely tidy office at Salisbury comprehensive in north London shortly after the publication of Gordon Brown's book on Courage. There, on the table, lies a pristine copy. Has Averre-Beeson read it, I ask. No, he hasn't, but the books a headteacher puts on show in his office are very important, he explains. I gaze around, but there are no bookshelves, only a small, neat row of books on his desk. The titles include Freakonomics (the modish American book that purports to expose the hidden wiring behind our daily behaviour), White Teeth (Zadie Smith's novel of multicultural London), Stumbling on Happiness and The Rules of Management.</p>
      <p>This is a man who likes you to know that he's abreast of the zeitgeist. He is more than six feet tall, an imposing, slightly distant figure, who looks and talks a bit like a company executive, which in a sense he is. He is one of a new breed: the super-head.</p>
      <p>He got the headship of a school in Ilford, east London, at 35. He then moved to another London comprehensive, Islington Green, which had a troubled history and was best known as the neighbourhood school that wasn't good enough for Tony Blair's children. On the evidence of his first few months there, Ofsted hailed him as "a visionary and transformational leader" who "communicates his vision very effectively to staff, pupils and parents".</p>
      <p>On a somewhat longer acquaintance, Peter Hyman - a former Blair aide who went into teaching, joined the Islington Green staff and wrote a book about it - describes Averre-Beeson as having "presentation skills that New Labour would be proud of". Not everyone might think that a compliment, but Averre-Beeson certainly would.</p>
      <p>Now, at 47, he has been parachuted - only 10 weeks before our interview - into Salisbury, where half the children are on free school meals and about 40% come from homes where English is a second language. Two years ago, the school was in special measures and the local authority feared it might return there. So, for a £1m contract (subject to penalties if targets aren't reached), the school management was handed over to Edison, a private company that runs around 100 schools in the US and works on "improvement" consultancies with about 50 UK schools. This is the first school where Edison has taken complete control, and it clearly believes it has the best head money can buy in Averre-Beeson, who is also on a three-year contract and was already working for the company as a consultant.</p>
      <p>How do you become a super-head? Averre-Beeson went to Sunbury grammar school in Surrey where, he says, "I became head boy, as one did". He recalls: "My headteacher said to me - and other students said - I would make a great teacher. And, when I did a presentation to my A-level economics class, the teacher said, you should be taking this class, Trevor."</p>
      <p>He trained at Leeds, after taking a degree in economics at Bradford. At a job interview, the head asked where he'd like to be in 15 years' time. "Sitting where you are," was Averre-Beeson's brisk reply. Later, "my head of year told me I was destined to be in charge, and I began to form the view, as an arrogant young graduate, that maybe I could do the job these people were doing, and maybe better than they were doing it".</p>
      <p>He didn't have to wait long. "I'd only been in teaching two years when I was promoted to head of year. I was leaping forward about eight or nine years in my career. It was very controversial that a 25-year-old was put in charge of one-sixth of the school."</p>
      <p>A deputy headship came along, at Braintree, in Essex, and he persuaded the head to let him introduce a new disciplinary system, which led to a big improvement in behaviour within half a term. "I got a media profile. I did a newsletter, which the local paper picked up. I was in the Times and the Mirror, and got on Kilroy-Silk and Joan Bakewell's Heart of the Matter." The headship duly followed. "I was the youngest secondary head in the country. The governors of that school took a real gamble. I take my hat off to them. By the age of 42, I was already an experienced head."</p>
      <p>No false modesty</p>
      <p>So that's how you do it and, while it would be unfair to suggest that Averre-Beeson doesn't intersperse his account with a bit of self-criticism ("I was naive and made mistakes," he says of his period as head of year), false modesty is clearly not a requirement for a super-head.</p>
      <p>But what's his secret for running a school successfully? In particular, what's his secret for keeping down exclusions? A year ago, Salisbury was excluding 70 pupils a term. Since Averre-Beeson's arrival, it has excluded none. His record at his previous schools was similar.</p>
      <p>For an explanation, we have to return to the disciplinary system he introduced at Braintree, which, like Edison, was an American import. It was called "assertive discipline", but Averre-Beeson revised it and renamed it "positive discipline".</p>
      <p>Traditional school rules, he argues, don't distinguish clearly enough between three different things: community rules (walk on the left, wear school uniform, arrive on time, don't bring mobile phones), aspirations (respect each other and respect your teachers) and rules of behaviour. The last, he says, are what teachers need in class. "They include 'listen in silence' and 'keep rude comments to yourself', but the key one is 'do as you're told'. It sounds blindingly obvious, but schools don't usually have that as a rule and, when I talk to teachers about it, they slap their heads because that's exactly what they need children to do."</p>
      <p>If the behaviour rules are to work, says Averre-Beeson, children need to know they will be punished if they transgress them, and rewarded, or at least recog nised, if they don't. The punishments start small - staying behind for two minutes at the end of a lesson, for example. Before the ultimate sanction of exclusion from school, children may suffer "internal exclusion" for up to three days, which requires them to continue with their usual work but in a separate room, in silence and sometimes without normal breaks.</p>
      <p>This is where Averre-Beeson's positive discipline differs from the original. "Assertive discipline talks about exiting children from classrooms, but doesn't say where they're to go," he explains. "You can't have them all sitting in corridors. I introduced an internal exclusion room 15 years ago, in my first headship, when it was almost unknown. Children like it less than being excluded from school. Being excluded means being at home, where they can sit and watch telly. This is a much more significant punishment."</p>
      <p>Awards ceremony</p>
      <p>The rewards also start small, with teachers' signatures in a book, but they can build up to calculators, pens, books, CD tokens and so on, culminating, for Salisbury children, in an awards ceremony at White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham football club. Isn't that bribery? "It would be if a boy misbehaves in every lesson and you say: if you sit still for this one, I'll give you a CD voucher. What I'm saying is that everybody who behaves well should be recognised, on a daily basis, lesson by lesson. What usually happens in schools is that kids know they've behaved well only in the negative: they didn't get told off in that lesson. Recognition is particularly important when they're on the cusp of behaving or not behaving."</p>
      <p>Averre-Beeson admits that, when he first introduced positive discipline at Braintree, it didn't quite work. After the initial improvement, everything unravelled and behaviour got worse than ever. "You have constantly to review, retrain and refresh staff, and monitor and reinvigorate the system. It isn't something you tell everybody about on September 1, and then it just carries on working. You have to make sure teachers are keeping a record and filling out each child's book every third week. It's all the documentation that makes the theory work."</p>
      <p>What Averre-Beeson admires about the Edison team is that they, too, have a system. "They have a well thought-through school improvement design, based on 15 years' research. They've thought about all the areas that make a difference. They include the importance of support for students and families where there are problems such as poverty, criminality or abuse. It has to be done, not just for the students concerned - who might be about 100 in an inner-city school of 1,200 - but to reduce the number of crises for the other 1,100."</p>
      <p>Does he have any reservations about private, profit-making companies running schools? "No. I have to be more aware of resources and the effective use of them because it's somebody's money. In local authorities, it's not anybody's money personally, and there are huge, labyrinthine bureaucracies that encourage everybody to watch their backs and not make decisions. Entrepreneurial heads run up against the buffer of people's caution."</p>
      <p>Averre-Beeson is right on board with the New Labour agenda. Ofsted is a good thing, league tables the best way to lever up standards. Teachers who criticise the government "might be biting the hand that feeds". As for city academies, Averre-Beeson backed turning Islington Green into one, against strong opposition from some teachers and parents. He describes them as "a socialistic thing" because "these business guys are putting millions of their money into a deprived area".</p>
      <p>As Hyman observes in his book, "Tony and Trevor have a lot in common". Averre-Beeson, like Blair, is a middle-class man with a classless accent, light on ideological baggage, driven, ambitious, optimistic and, Hyman argues (and I think I detected Averre-Beeson using the word of himself), charismatic.</p>
      <p>Both had a youthful interest in theatre, which, in Averre-Beeson's case, included an early appearance in the BBC's Play for Today series; he spent much of his boyhood in Shepperton, near the west London film studios. The former prime minister and the super-head even have a brief childhood spell overseas in common: Blair in Australia, Averre-Beeson in Nigeria, where his lecturer father worked at the University of Lagos.</p>
      <p>Rock band</p>
      <p>Most strikingly, Averre-Beeson also played in a student rock band, though with more success than Blair. The Press got as far as a deal with EMI, for an advance of £7,000, then a substantial sum. "We died the most terrible of deaths," recalls Averre-Beeson. "They released one single and I think we heard it played on the radio just once. They dropped us like a shot." The decision to enter teaching rapidly followed.</p>
      <p>Averre-Beeson was already married, with a child. At a pop festival, his wife, breastfeeding in the van, pointed in turn to the guitar and the baby. "I can't remember whether she actually used the words, but she was saying I had to make a choice." But, unlike Blair, Averre-Beeson has managed to revive his career, forming a band with former colleagues from Ilford and playing occasional gigs in the upstairs rooms of London pubs. The guitar has pride of place in his school study, along with photos &amp;#8800;of the band.</p>
      <p>As with Blair, you admire the performance without quite being sure about the substance. But he's successfully run three schools in deprived areas, rallied teachers behind him, enlisted highly placed allies, got himself on the telly, and become a sought-after speaker for conferences and training days. The super-head's record speaks for itself, and I suspect we shall hear much more of him.</p>

      <title>Weekend: WHOSE EUROPE IS IT ANYWAY?: A new Europe is taking shape. More united, yes, but is it also increasingly xenophobic? Travelling from country to country, Linda Grant finds that the danger is less the resurgence of old-style fascism than the rise of 'modern' , democratically elected, far-right parties, on the model of Jorg Haider's Freedom Party in Austria, whose aim is to turn the continent into a largely white fortress.</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is May 9, Europe Day. Ragged, marching lines of schoolchildren enter the Klagenfurt town square waving the blue-and-gold flags of the European Union under a cloudless sky. Lining the square, Europe has set out its stalls: Euro pens; Euro hats; Euro stickers; and Roland Prinz, an executive of the Hypo Bank, in a tie decorated with samples of the new euro currency, is glowing with Euro-pride as he thrusts into people's hands postcards which, like his tie, depict the banknotes that in two years' time will replace the Austrian schilling. More and more children arrive, and the square is now filled with Euro people, who five years ago, before entry into the EU, were just Austrians living in the region of Carinthia, on the border of Italy and Slovenia. One school has marked the event by giving each child a placard listing one of the rights enshrined in the European charter: freedom to work; freedom of religion; equality before the law, no censorship. Another has handed every pupil a home-made sign with the flag of a different country bearing the word peace in its language. Paix! Shalom! It's the opposite of a Nuremberg rally - informal, undisciplined, all the racist poison sucked out of it. Except that, according to the programme, the keynote speaker is to be Jorg Haider, governor of Carinthia and, until his resignation earlier that year, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, a man now tagged as Europe's most dangerous racist and xenophobe.</p>
      <p>(Haider, however, denies that his anti-immigration policies are xenophobic or racist.) Someone says he has decided not to turn up, after all. Where is he? In Vienna. Yet rumours persist that he might yet show, for he is, it's said, a law unto himself, who travels by helicopter and, like God, can be anywhere at short notice. And so we look up at the sky, hoping to hear a heavy drone.</p>
      <p>Because of Haider, Austria is under EU sanctions, Israel has cut off diplomatic relations, tourism to the country has plummeted, and Austrians themselves, travelling abroad, are being greeted with a cold shoulder. Last year, on October 3, the Freedom Party (FPO) came second in the elections, throwing the country into political paralysis and sparking the largest protest demonstrations Austria has ever known. After months of agonising, in February the FPO was invited by the conservative People's Party, under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Schussel, to join a coalition, partly in fear that, if no government could be formed and fresh elections were held, the FPO would win outright with its appeal to nationalism and calls for measures to restrict the numbers of foreign workers allowed into the country.</p>
      <p>A couple of months before the end of Europe's most catastrophically violent century, people were talking once more of a new menace coming out of Austria. Was Haider the new fuhrer, an Austrian dictator who would provoke a world war? The comparison between Haider and Hitler is probably hysterical. Periods of history are not templates that can be imposed on each other. Austria has a population of eight million, and it took one of its foreign workers, an Israeli who runs a fast-food stand near a U-Bahn station in Vienna, to put things into perspective: "Germany in the 30s was a strong country; it had an army, an air force, a navy - things Hitler could use to get what he wanted," he said. "This place? What's Austria got? Nothing. It's a country of no consequence. It's got no military. No industry. Ski slopes - that's all."</p>
      <p>We would be fools to believe that nazism is resurgent in Europe. Seventy years ago, totalitarianism was not imposed on the people; it was a political movement with mass and intellectual support. In his book, Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century, the historian Mark Mazower describes the hostility to democracy among the thinkers and politicians of the right in the 20s who dismissed parliamentarianism as "sluggish, materialistic, unexciting and incapable of arousing the sympathy of the masses". The experiment in excitement was, of course, a disaster. Despite the endurance of a few skinheads, vandalism in Jewish cemeteries and an admiration for the racist and anti-Semite (formerly known as a historian) David Irving, there is no real taste for fascism in Europe these days. If there is anything to fear, we will find it rooted in democratically elected parties that want all the economic benefits of EU membership without the political consequences.</p>
      <p>A new vision of a Europe is emerging. Borderless inside, it would form a largely white fortress to stand against the alien hordes of Muslims and former communists that menace it from the east, a place that pays lip-service to a tolerance of Jews while focusing on the main agenda, which is to keep immigrants out. In an opinion poll carried out by the French National Human Rights Commission earlier this year, 68% of respondents agreed with the statement: "The presence in France of people from non-European countries is disturbing."</p>
      <p>In Denmark, Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the ultra nationalist Danish People's Party with 18% support in opinion polls, regards Muslims as "as good a people as you or me, but it's a problem in a Christian country to have too many Muslims". According to the Organi-sation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, Denmark is one of the world's richest countries, with the least success in incorporating foreigners into the workforce. Souhail Ibrahim, a Palestinian who left the Social Democrats in January to form an immigrants' party, told a newspaper, "I don't think Austria will do half of what they're doing to foreigners in Denmark." In Belgium, the Flemish Vlaams Blok, based in its Antwerp stronghold where it attracts 15% of the vote in regional elections, calls for an immediate halt to immigration and the expulsion of unemployed immigrants who are there already. In Norway, the Progress Party, on 15%, wants to divert money spent on immigrants to pensions and health care for Norwegians. And in Britain, with no far right worth speaking of, Labour and Conservatives vie with each other to criminalise refugees and asylum seekers, driving them into detention camps.</p>
      <p>Who will be at the helm of this new Europe? Across the other side of Klagenfurt town square, Roland Prinz formally introduces me to a smiling, courteous man with a neatly trimmed beard. He gives me his card, which is decorated with the flag of the European Union and the coat of arms of Carinthia, and identifies the bearer as Dr Johannes Maier, Landesmanndirektion, EU-Koordinationstelle: he is the civil servant who advises Haider on European affairs. Maier was delighted to speak to the Guardian, "a great newspaper" he said, in contrast to the response to previous efforts to get an interview with Haider himself. We stood and shielded our eyes from the strong sunlight as the children paraded with their European flags. "Mr Haider is not understood in Europe," he told me. "Yes, he made mistakes in former times, but now he is trying to make policies like any other regional governor in Europe. Please remember, we are not against Europe, we are one of the weaker regions south of the Alpine line, one of the economically weakest regions of Austria and we profit from Europe - one billion schillings (pounds 45 million) a year. But if we look at Europe as a whole, we see that we have no great politician any more, like Mitterand and Kohl, someone who sees Europe as more important than the interests of his country."</p>
      <p>And is Haider that great man? "Mr Haider is a very intelligent politician," Maier replied. "He can speak very well and pronounce the problems of the people. He is one of the most important politicians now living."</p>
      <p>In Haider's 1995 treatise, a book called The Freedom I Mean, he sets out his vision not just for Austria but for Europe, and so for us, too: "The concept of a 'multicultural society' has become an ideology," he writes. "Any policy of immigration must insist on assimilation and adaptation to the culture and norms of the indigenous population . . . Especially in education we have to defend Christian values. As more immigrants bring their children into western Europe, the indigenous population is slowly being substituted by aliens. It's hard to understand why Catholic bishops and clerics march in the streets defending a multi- cultural utopia when the threat to Christianity is so obvious . . . From 1989-1992, 10,400 new jobs were created in eastern Austria and all of them were filled by cheap foreign labour. At the same time employment of Austrians declined by 1,300 . . . For (our ruling politicians) it's more important to experiment with our youth as guinea pigs in abstract, multicultural programmes." And finally, in a grand sign-off: "Our movement seeks to rally the friends of freedom to regenerate the old democracies and inspire the new. Our enemies are legion both in eastern Europe and the west, where the threats are more subtle and insidious. The road will not be easy, but the rewards will be worth the struggle. That is the challenge for Austria. That is the vision for Europe. That is the freedom I mean."</p>
      <p>Does this sound familiar - particularly the invocation of some hazily defined "enemies" on to whom the reader can pin any label he chooses?</p>
      <p>What is the Freedom Party? It can protest as much as it likes, but the records show that it is directly descended from Austrian National Socialism. In 1945, there were 500,000 registered Nazis in the country. Deprived of the vote until the 1949 election, they formed such a formidable force that neither Conservatives nor Social Democrats dared ignore them, and considerable numbers were absorbed into these two main parties. Immediately after the election, Austria's Nazis organised their own party, the Association of Independents, which split in 1955 but re-formed itself one year later as the Freedom Party. Haider's father, Robert, had joined the Hitler Youth in 1929 and later became a member of the Austrian National Socialists, joining the FPO on its formation. His son became party secretary in Carinthia in 1976 and, supported by the party's most right wing elements, overthrew its liberal wing to become leader in 1986. The last of the liberals left the FPO in 1993. In 1994, according to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance, the FPO campaigned against Austria joining the EU "using theories of worldwide conspiracies connected with barely concealed anti-semitic arguments".</p>
      <p>The FPO's success in recent years is not necessarily because Austria's voters are covert Nazis but because of the corruption of the two main parties, the Conservatives and the Social Democrats, who have shared power continuously since the end of the war. What alternative do Haider and the FPO offer? A few days before I arrived in Carinthia, I sat in the office of the Documentation Centre's director, Wolfgang Neugebauer, the son of a former lieutenant in the SS, who has spent much of his life documenting Austria's Nazi past. He is a spare, blond man who at school, in the 50s, had come under the influence of socialists and somehow wrenched himself away from his father's fascism. "Haider is a right wing extremist," he said. "He is a racist and xenophobe. Not everyone in the party has the same opinions (as he does), but this is a fuhrer party, a leader party, and he dominates it. After his retirement at the party congress, he still remains the most important politician in the party, and I'm sure that in the next elections he will be a candidate for the Federal Chancellorship. I am not afraid of some small Nazi groups in Austria. The greater danger is the coalition between a party like the FPO, with strong anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies, and a conservative party, and such developments can take place in other countries, too. Such a coalition can realise policy where small groups of extremists can't." Would Haider's election as Chancellor be comparable to the election of Hitler in 1933? "No, I don't think so," he replied. "This is not possible in Europe in this time, but I think he will try to realise his propaganda in the field of foreign labourers and immigrants. There will be a stop to further immigration and, perhaps, the expulsion of refugees. And there will be some reduction in freedom of opinion by cutting the subsidies for newspapers."</p>
      <p>In Vienna, I bought a copy of the Economist, because its cover story was about Europe's need for more immigrants. Because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, it stated, "Europe's working population is falling, while Europeans' aspirations to do only clean, sedentary, well-paid jobs are constantly on the rise." It described a new sort of migrant, a "labour tourist", who shuttles "resourcefully back and forth across an EU border, usually from eastern Europe into Germany and Austria, and often earns a living in the Union to support a family outside it." Economically, foreign workers are exactly what Europe needs but, to the Economist writer, this is being hampered by Europe's failure to adjust to being a continent of immigration, such as America or Australia, instead of a continent of nation states. Europe is currently desperate for workers trained in hi-tech skills, which India is now producing in huge numbers, but would-be emigrants are reluctant to go to Germany, where they are only offered short-term contracts with no right to bring their families. America pays more, and offers them and their families citizenship.</p>
      <p>The two men I bought the magazine from were victims of this myopia. They were immigrants from India . They had come 10 years ago on student visas to gain degrees in business studies, leaving their wives at home, and, like many non-white entrants to the country, had never been able to turn that initial entry into a work permit. One of them explained how the system operated: "You apply for a job, and the boss of the company will give you a paper for the government labour office and they should give you permission to work, but a lot of people have been living here for up to eight years and every time they go to the government office, they say no, and this is much more common for Indians and Africans than for Yugoslavs." One of the anomalies of the new borderless Europe is that its non-citizens do not share the right to work in other EU countries. The two newspaper sellers were effectively resident in Austria, but not the EU.</p>
      <p>The only way they had found to earn a living was to work for a firm, which required them to take 100 copies a day of a newspaper called Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular paper, similar in its appeal to our own Daily Mail. They were expected to sell 80 of these; if there was a shortfall, they had to pay for the unsold copies themselves. Being forced to sell Kronen Zeitung was a humiliation: "The paper is always against foreigners. Every day there's more propaganda, and nobody talks about it, not the Social Democrats, not the Greens. They are always writing about Africans, saying they are drug dealers." Abuse and racist attacks from neo-Nazis wasn't the main problem. One of the men showed me the apartment rental ads in Kronen Zeitung and pointed out the line in almost every one that said, "Austrians only". They saw racism as sewn into the very fabric of the country.</p>
      <p>While we were talking, a man who was looking at Rolling Stone could no longer contain himself. "In my opinion, Kronen Zeitung is a newspaper which manipulates everything, including photos," he said. He explained that recently the paper had run a picture of an anti-Freedom Party demonstrator hitting a policeman. A week or so later, it was exposed as the juxtaposition of two separate photographs. "If you manipulate photographs and no one complains, what kind of a country is this?" he asked. His name was Edward Boehler, he was 36, a veteran of the anti-Haider demonstrations, and he worked for an advertising agency. I asked him why people his age voted for the FPO. "These are the new yuppies who are interested in their careers and not in immigrants," he said. "They see themselves as the cool, clever people of the new century. They're not really interested in the roots of the Freedom Party. For them, it's the party that takes us very fast into the chic future. For myself, I would be very glad if in 10 or 20 years' time, Austria didn't exist any more. It's just a region. But I don't think many Austrians think this."</p>
      <p>In Britain, we are used to thinking of the right and the far right in a particular way: little Englanders, nostalgic for Britain's long-lost greatness, insular, conservative. In Austria, the reverse is true. Boehler's description of the FPO supporters' amputation of history helped me understand a puzzling conversation I'd had the night before over a drink in the area of Vienna known as the Bermuda Triangle, a maze of streets heaving with bars and restaurants, and full of the hip young people of Vienna, indistinguishable from their counterparts in London's Camden Town or New York's East Village. Here, I thought, I would hear the voice of young Austria, the anti-Haider forces who have led the demonstrations. So, sitting at a table outside the Casablanca bar, I asked the people at the next table, six old schoolfriends, all in their mid-20s, about Europe. They were all for it. They understood implicitly the advantage of being able to work and travel in other countries. Yet they confirmed that, politically, they were on the right and one of them, the most articulate, was an economics student who was sympathetic to the FPO.</p>
      <p>"Haider says we must be newer," said Markus. "The FPO is not racist. If they were, do you think I would have voted for them? It's a democratic party, and here in Austria we are a democracy. I know people who went to the demonstrations and it's their democratic right - in Austria, everyone has the right to say what they want." The other five nodded in agreement. The only girl with them said, "If the FPO makes mistakes, they will not be in parliament." Once again, I understood how it was possible to build a party of the far right among people who consider themselves to be the same as their peers in other European countries, not special, or different, or secretly plotting a campaign for world domination.</p>
      <p>But what about the FPO's Nazi past? Had they studied the legacy of fascism in school? They all insisted that they had. As for the FPO, Markus pointed out, "Most of the higher national socialists after the war went into the socialist and conservative parties. All the old Nazis were integrated without questions. It's strange, of course, but it's like in Russia with the communist party (some of whose members are now in government), and it was the same with us in 1945." When they themselves raised the question of immigrants, it was the refugees from the former Yugoslavia that concerned them.</p>
      <p>The FPO has retooled its image to accommodate voters such as the kids in the Bermuda Triangle. Its headquarters in Klagenfurt was a shining sea of polished wood floors and sleekly dressed young men and women rushing back and forth on urgent business. And from every wall the tanned, fit figure of Jorg Haider looked down. Gradually, the FPO has shifted its rhetoric away from EU-bashing. It senses the mood of those voters who see the personal advantages of membership. The FPO's agenda has become the business of defining who gets to be in Europe: both the immigrants who want to cross its borders and the nations that are accepted for membership.</p>
      <p>Christian Ragger, aged 25 and a member of the General Assembly of Carinthia, is the youngest elected politician in Austria and the FPO's legal adviser on EU sanctions. Ragger argues that Europe failed to understand that Austria had special difficulties because of its proximity to the former Czechoslovakia. If a Carinthian expected a wage of pounds 500 a month, then a Slovenian would work for pounds 200 because of the lower cost of living. "The EU will allow Slovenians to come from over the border and work here for less money. Our workers cost more to employ, so we will get unemployment. What the Freedom Party says is that we want Slovenia to be part of Europe, but in 10 years, to give time for the income to equalise."</p>
      <p>I asked him if the FPO was racist. "I have been in the FPO for eight years here in Carinthia, where 42% vote FPO, and I have never heard from one member a racist word, and I am no racist," he said. "I am a lawyer and I have studied in many countries. My best friends are foreigners. But we have to come up with a lot of very hard answers - that we have enough foreigners, that the state spends more money than it gets from them. We need three to four thousand foreign workers, but the problem is that we get not skilled workers but unskilled workers - Africans, Turks, Yugoslavs." Was he happy to be in a party led by a man with so negative a public image abroad? "In 1986,when he took over, the FPO won 4%. Now we are at 27%," he pointed out. "And all this comes from Jorg Haider. That is his doing."</p>
      <p>From Klagenfurt, after the Euro Day rally, we moved on to Dresden. East Germany interested me because it was a former iron curtain country that had had to integrate itself not only into a new national identity but into Europe again after a 44-year break. Dresden has been more successful than other parts of the former GDR, because it has become the powerhouse of the German hi-tech industries and the region's new nickname is Silicon Saxony. Nevertheless, Dresden's unemployment rate is still 17%; in the border areas next to Poland and the Czech Republic, rates are closer to 30%. Half a century after the Allied bombings, the city centre has successfully reinvented itself as Germany's cultural capital, but the baroque buildings of the interior are a showcase that conceals the stagnation of miles of postwar workers' flats.</p>
      <p>Unlike Berlin, which is effectively an international city, Dresden and Saxony, like Carinthia, are virtually all-white. What has emerged in this region mirrors attitudes in Austria: economic hostility towards the alien hordes from the east. There is precious little fellow feeling for former iron curtain comrades. "Legal work for the Poles and Czechs here is possible but difficult," said Christian Streifler, political editor of Sachsische Zeitung, Saxony's regional newspaper. "People in a neighbourhood who see a car with Polish plates sitting in front of a house for weeks are likely to report it to the police. The fear is what will happen after the Czech Republic and Poland become members of the EU, and the fear is strongest in the border regions, with the highest unemployment rates in Germany. The lowest wages in the country are on the German side of the border, and on the other side are people who will work for a half or a third."</p>
      <p>The political party that seems most closely to address these anxieties is the PDS (Democratic Socialist Party), the former communist party. Who votes for it, I asked Streifler. "People who work in the public sector and who worked in the public sector before, bureaucrats in local government, not high-ranking managers, because most of them are from the west. And young people from the squatters movement. All the older people are anti-EU, very sceptical about all these strangers coming into the town. They think, 'This western society does much more for the foreigners than for us, who have served their whole life for the communist state.' Europe is an idea, nothing real; they feel Saxonian. Europe is good for one thing. To give money."</p>
      <p>The danger for Europe is that the PDS could one day wake up and reinvent itself as a party modelled on FPO lines. If Haider becomes Chancellor of Austria (and not a single person I spoke to doubted for a moment that his resignation as head of the FPO was anything but a tactic), we will have a model far right Euro-party dedicated not to world domination and the Final Solution but to turning the con tinent into a fortress against foreigners, defined as Asians and Slavs, though, as Norman Davies points out in his book, Europe: A History, not a day has gone by in the past 1,000 years when the muezzin has not sounded somewhere in Europe. In Britain, the leader of the British National Party told the Guardian in May that he has already drawn a lesson from Haider's example, observing "what a nationalist party can do, by moderating its language and thus appealing to ordinary people".</p>
      <p>Europe has not developed evenly. There are portions of the continent that have strenuously attempted to develop a new ethnic geography of Europe. Wherever we travelled, we found the people who had thought the most, and who had the most sophisticated understanding of Europe's problems, were from the former West Germany. We arranged to visit the Mercedes factory at Singelfingen, a half- hour's drive away from Stuttgart, because out of its workforce of 37,000, 24% were non-Germans who came from 60 different countries; 2,000 were from Turkey. There seemed every reason that the Mercedes plant would be a microcosm of the problems besetting Europe as a whole: a workforce of second-class citizens paid less than their German colleagues; fights breaking out on the factory floor between the representatives of various of the world's ethnic conflicts; grim housing beyond the factory gates which would be a magnet for neo-Nazi skinhead assaults.</p>
      <p>This was not the case. Mercedes had created its own pan-European world with its own pan-European rules, resisting any attempt by its parent company, Chrysler, to impose American working practices on the plant. The managers who had visited Chrysler's plant in Alabama were appalled by what they had seen there: a workforce divided along race lines; poor working conditions and a hostility to the unions. Mercedes gleamed and shone with success, and so did its shopfloor workers. Back in the 60s, Mercedes had placed advertisements in the Turkish papers calling for workers to come to Germany. Large numbers had answered the call. Mercedes never created company towns. It drew its workforce from as far away as the Black Forest, where small farmers would leave their families to run the farm while they commuted by bus to the factory. When the foreign workers began to arrive in Germany, Mercedes built temporary hostels for them. As they began to send for their families, they bought houses and apartments in the outlying villages, exactly like their German co-workers.</p>
      <p>I spent about two hours probing Edith Meissner, head of public relations at the Singelfingen plant, Sezayi Erol, a Turkish-born masterforeman, and manager Markus Buhler about racism in the factory and the outlying areas, and I got nowhere. "I have been here since 1993, and there has never been one case of racism on the shop floor," Meissner told me. "I think one reason is that, when people come inside here, they feel as Mercedes workers, and Mercedes world has its own rules. They avoid conflict, I'm sure, because they don't want to lose their job, because Mercedes workers are among the best paid in Germany. Our Turkish people own a house and they save very hard and get a company discount and drive a Mercedes. You can't solve all problems, but you need to have success. It's very simple. The company is very, very successful, and success brings people together."</p>
      <p>Meissner's view of Europe was far from that of Haider. I asked if she could define what the continent was (according to the historian, Norman Davies, it should really be seen as a peninsula of Asia that begins at the Urals): "I studied geography, and so I know exactly where Europe ends," she said. "But there is a difference between geographic thinking and the thinking of the heart. For me, the heart of Europe is Germany, France, Benelux. Then comes Austria and Switzerland, very close together. Historically, Czechoslovakia and Poland - this is middle Europe, but we forgot this during the times of the iron curtain. When I first went to Prague, I realised that the heart of Europe is much further east than it was before. So, if you ask what Europe is, it changes even in one life."</p>
      <p>Meissner was in Vienna when Haider was elected. "There was a large demonstration and I talked to many people in the streets. What Haider does, which is dangerous, is that he picks up the dark emotions of the people, very often of simple people who don't have the advantages of this new borderless Europe. And there are disadvantages, to be honest - for example, if your children are in school and more than half are of non-German parents. I think the only way democratic people can convince other democratic people that there must be other solutions is to talk with openness about immigrants, about social differences, about open borders, and how to handle language differences in school. A lot of the problems are because we don't discuss this openly in Europe, and in Germany, too."</p>
      <p>It was a German we met in a Stuttgart restaurant who anatomised the Austrian problem for us. Gerhard Thumm, son of a one-time Nazi and himself now a resident of France, made a point that would be made to us again and again. "Austria is in the same situation we were in Germany up to 10 years ago," he said. "They are at the very beginning of thinking about the past, a process we in Germany have nearly finished. This means, for me, the end of the very difficult situation of self-examination. The Austrians for 50 years have ignored the past, as the French until 10 years ago ignored their own history of collaboration." I would later put this to Wolfgang Neugebauer who agreed: "I think this opinion is now accepted by politicians, scientists and historians, but not by the broad population of Austria. For the Austrians to learn to think as Europeans is a very slow process. It began in 1995, but now it is stopped by the conflict between the government and the other European states. And the building of the coalition with the Freedom Party has also stopped the process."</p>
      <p>It is this inability to confront and examine the past that is, I think, at the heart of Europe's difficulties. Immediately after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the former GDR saw the sudden re-emergence of the far right, and this was because, Christian Streifler said, in the east, "No one had to ask himself: what was my responsibility (in the Nazi period), or the responsibility of my father or my grandfather? These questions no one here has answered at any time." Nor were they answering them elsewhere. In the two weeks we travelled through France, Germany, Austria and Belgium, no one said, "Yes, I am a racist" (though statistically many of them must have been). Simply by asserting that once their leaders had done "bad things" and pointing out that the things currently proclaimed as "bad" were not the same ones, they felt themselves to be absolved. No one wanted to gas Turks, of course not. But as they had once felt Jews to be aliens from the east, now they felt the same way, not just about Muslims but people who lived a few miles away in a country that, because it wasn't in the EU, was definitively not Europe.</p>
      <p>Crossing the border into Austria and taking two local trains east, we came to Brannau-am-Inn. Only one significant event ever happened in this remarkably pretty place of pastel houses. The town's tourist office helpfully provides a leaflet of local sights, including - to save you the embarrassment of having to ask - the exact location of the house where Hitler was born in 1889.</p>
      <p>The history teacher at the local school, Florian Katanko, wants to try to raise the money to buy the house, currently used as workshops for people with disabilities, and turn it into an international centre of reconciliation. The scheme has made many people outside Brannau uneasy. They feel that the house should be pulled down. To Katanko, "it is part of the past, but it is our past". He wants to find a way of acknowledging it but moving on. To others in Brannau, the house is a big joke, being such a tourist attraction. And living in such close proximity to the very origins of Europe's darkness - where police storm the town every year on April 20 to stop neo-Nazis from making the house a site of pilgrimage - does not prevent the people of Brannau from voting 60% in favour of the Freedom Party.</p>
      <p>For more than 50 years, Austria described itself as Germany's "first victim", despite the evidence of history that shows the ecstatic reception the Nazis received when they marched into Vienna in 1938. Benischke Friedbert, one of Katanko's fellow teachers, admitted the truth of this: "At the end of the war, the Allies didn't force the education system to deal with the past as they did in Germany. After the Kurt Waldheim affair, that changed, but only then did the process of thinking about our past begin."</p>
      <p>We returned to London, having five times crossed international borders and not s</p>
      <p>een a single immigration official until the train approached the tunnel on the F</p>
      <p>rench side and the Metropolitan Police began the first of what would be three se</p>
      <p>curity checks before we were allowed into Britain. The British government is now</p>
      <p>proposing that security staff be posted at the Paris and Brussels terminals to</p>
      <p>check for asylum seekers planning to board the Eurostar. The night after I got b</p>
      <p>ack, I went to a party to celebrate the publication of Between Two Camps: Nation</p>
      <p>s, Cultures And The Allure Of Race, by Paul Gilroy, a black British academic who</p>
      <p>, like me, believes (or naively hopes) that a new Europe is emerging, containing</p>
      <p>people with multiple national identities, which transcend the borders laid down</p>
      <p>by international law. Travelling around Europe, however, his experience had bee</p>

      <p>"My mother was rudely spat at and abused on buses in Vienna," he said. "Haider comes from a Nazi background in a world where a lot of people who make these moves don't. He's been deeply shaped by that legacy. I'm asking what we do when the Haider figures aren't traceable back, when they don't come with an icon attached to them."</p>
      <p>Haiderism seeps into everything. The Labour Party, despite itself, is tinged with it. It's in the Asylum Bill, it's in the response to head-scarved women begging with children on the London streets. The Tory Party could, with great ease, turn itself into an FPO without Nazi roots. What is the Europe we want? Where does it begin and end? Who belongs in it? Who has the right to call themselves a European? These are the questions to which Haiderism has a set of answers. Do we have another?</p>

      <title>G2: Arts: That's showbusiness: His TV series The Shock of the New changed the way people thought about modern art. A quarter of a century on, Robert Hughes has returned to the story - and found a world overtaken by money and celebrity</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Twenty-five years is a mere eyeblink in the story of Egyptian, Mayan or even medieval English art, but it is a long time in the modern or (weasel word) post-modern context, and if one is given a single programme - a mere 55 minutes - to bring the story up to date from where The Shock of the New left off when we finished making the series, one is bound to fail. Too much has happened in art. Not all of that "too much", admittedly, is compelling or even interesting, but the ground is choked with events that defy brief, coherent summary. So we decided to sample rather than summarise. Most of the "1980s artists" over whom such a fuss was made have turned out to be merely rhetorical, or inept, or otherwise fallen by the wayside. Is there anyone who really cares much what Julian Schnabel or David Salle, for instance, are now doing? Do the recent paintings of Sandro Chia or Georg Baselitz excite interest? Maybe in your breast, but not in mine.</p>
      <p>The period has been full of conceptual art, but conceptual art makes for utterly droning TV. On the other hand, there are a few - a very few - artists of the "neo-expressionist" generation whose work continues its efforts to take on the burden of history, to struggle to explain our bizarre and terrible times to us in memorable visual terms, and one of the most complex and rewarding of these talents, uneven though he can be, is surely Anselm Kiefer. No less so is Paula Rego, a painter I'd hardly heard of until a few years ago because she was scarcely known in the US - but how strongly put together, how viscerally and deeply felt, are her renderings of bad parental authority and of the psychic nightmares that lie just be low the supposedly sweet surface of childhood! Rego is a great subversive without a trace of the dull, academic conceptualism that renders the more approved American radical-feminists of the 80s-90s so tedious - and she draws superbly, which her sisters across the Atlantic have either forgotten or never learned to do. Like Kiefer, but unlike most painters at work today, she does art with a strong political content that never turns into a merely ideological utterance.</p>
      <p>It used to be that media-based, photo-derived art looked almost automatically "interesting". It cut to the chase instantly, it mimicked the media-glutted state of general consciousness, it was democratic - sort of. The high priest of this situation was of course the hugely influential Andy Warhol, paragon of fast art. I am sure that though his influence probably will last (if only because it renders artmaking easier for the kiddies) his paragonhood won't, and despite the millions now paid for his Lizzes and Elvises, he will shrink to relative insignificance, a historical figure whose resonance is used up. There will be a renewed interest - not for everyone, of course, but for those who actually know and care about the issues - in slow art: art that takes time to develop on the retina and in the mind, that sees instant communication as the empty fraud it is, that relates strongly to its own traditions.</p>
      <p>It doesn't matter whether the work is figurative or not. Sean Scully's big abstracts retain much more than a memory of experienced architecture, but they relate to the human body too, and there is something wonderfully invigorating about the measured density with which their paint brings them into the world. Not everything of value is self-evident and there is no reason in the world why art should be. Nor is it true that instantaneous media, such as photography and video, should or can deliver "more" truth than drawing. All you can say is that they offer a different sort of truth. This is an issue with which an artist like David Hockney has been struggling for years, and it's fascinating to see how he has given up on the photographic collages he used to make in favour of pure recording in watercolour, of which he is such a master.</p>
      <p>Styles come and go, movements briefly coalesce (or fail to, more likely), but there has been one huge and dominant reality overshadowing Anglo-Euro-American art in the past 25 years, and The Shock of the New came out too early to take account of its full effects. This is the growing and tyrannous power of the market itself, which has its ups and downs but has so hugely distorted nearly everyone's relationship with aesthetics. That's why we decided to put Jeff Koons in the new programme: not because his work is beautiful or means anything much, but because it is such an extreme and self-satisfied manifestation of the sanctimony that attaches to big bucks. Koons really does think he's Michelangelo and is not shy to say so. The significant thing is that there are collectors, especially in America, who believe it. He has the slimy assurance, the gross patter about transcendence through art, of a blow-dried Baptist selling swamp acres in Florida. And the result is that you can't imagine America's singularly depraved culture without him. He fits into Bush's America the way Warhol fitted into Reagan's. There may be worse things waiting in the wings (never forget that morose observation of Milton's on the topo-graphy of Hell: "And in the lowest depth, a lower depth") but for the moment they aren't apparent, which isn't to say that they won't crawl, glistening like Paris Hilton's lip-gloss, out of some gallery next month. Koons is the perfect product of an art system in which the market controls nearly everything, including much of what gets said about art.</p>
      <p>An interesting result of the growing power of the market is that artists and their dealers are looking for ways, through copyright law, to con trol what is written or broadcast about the work, so as to prevent critics who might feel less than prostrate admiration for it from saying anything about it at all. On TV, if you can't show, you can't tell. I have seen quite a lot of this in recent years; it is here to stay, and getting worse. Sometimes the results look merely silly, as when the American conceptual artist Mel Bochner, whose work (consisting of vaguely related words printed in capitals on canvas in various tasteful colours) we filmed in the last Whitney Biennial in New York, waited until a few days before broadcast to announce, through his agent, that he "did not wish to participate" in our film. Never mind.</p>
      <p>Damien Hirst was another story. We were in London, hoping to film some of Hirst's work and perhaps a brief interview with him for The New Shock of the New. Oh no, absolutely not, came the word back. "Damien," said his gallery, "is very fragile to criticism." Could this fragile aesthete re ally be the Hemingwoid sheep-slicer, dot-painter and all-round bad boy? I had not actually written about Hirst's work (though I consider him a much more real artist than some of the lesser geniuses of our time) but it was clear he suspected he might be treated as someone less than Michelangelo or, for that matter, Richard Serra. The last message from him was that never, no-how, under no circumstances, could we film anything of his in the current show at the Tate, In a Gadda da Vida. Why? "Conservation reasons," it said. Better to discourage anything being said about the great work than risk the utterance of dissent or doubt.</p>
      <p>I think the drift of such examples (and there are plenty of others) is clear enough. The art world is now so swollen with currency and the vanity of inflated reputation that it is taking on some of the less creditable aspects of showbiz. Hollywood doesn't want critics, it wants PR folk and profile-writers. Showbiz controls journalism by controlling access. The art world hopes to do the same, though on a more piddly level. No other domain of culture would try this one on. No publisher, fearing that an unfavourable review, would attempt to stop a book critic quoting from some novel. No producer would make a guarantee of innocuousness the price of a critic's ticket to the theatre. It just wouldn't happen. But in art, it can. And since it can, as Bill Clinton remarked in another context, it does.</p>
      <p>The New Shock of the New is on BBC2, Saturday, 9.05pm.</p>

      <title>G2: Law: A blow for freedom: The supreme court ruling that Guantanamo Bay prisoners can challenge their detention in the US is almost certain to lead to hundreds being released, says Conor Gearty</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The US supreme court's two rulings that terrorist suspects held at Guantanamo Bay and in America must have access to the US courts are among the most remarkable in the long history of that famous institution. The positive implications for the hundreds of internees held by the US across the world have yet to be clarified but will be immense. The chance to argue their cases is almost certain to lead to the release of hundreds of detainees. Already the habeas corpus applications have started to roll in, and the Bush administration seems at a loss as to what to do.</p>
      <p>The rulings will go a long way towards restoring the credibility both of the judiciary in the minds of the American public and, more importantly, of the US system of government in the eyes of the world. What the supreme court justices have said will make the shallow metaphor of an unending "war on terror" far harder to sustain, and may even hasten the end of an administration which this very same court effectively appointed nearly four years ago when it stopped the Florida vote recount.</p>
      <p>In the first of the two cases, brought in the names of Rasul and Al Odah, two Australian and 12 Kuwaiti citizens challenged their detention in Guantanamo following their capture abroad during hostilities between the US and the Taliban. Their attempt to challenge the legality of their detention before an independent tribunal and to obtain access to counsel floundered in the lower federal courts. The reason was a supreme court decision from 1950 concerning German prisoners who had been captured and convicted of war crimes in China and had then been imprisoned in occupied Germany (Johnson v Eisentrager).</p>
      <p>That case appeared to establish unequivocally that aliens detained outside the sovereign territory of the US may not make a habeas corpus application to try to secure their release. It must have been a shock to the administration when the supreme court even decided to take the Rasul and Al Odah cases on, despite such clear authority - the first sign that events in the courtroom were spinning out of control.</p>
      <p>Delivering the court's opinion - reflecting the votes of five of the nine justices - Justice John Paul Stevens made a point of distinguishing between the two situations: the citizens in the case before them were from countries not at war with the US; they had denied being engaged in or plotting acts of aggression against the US; they had never been afforded access to any tribunal, much less been charged with and convicted of any wrongdoing; and the territory in which they had been imprisoned was a place over which the US exercised exclusive jurisdiction and control. To destroy the authority of Eisentrager without simply and crudely overruling it, Stevens had to engage in some characteristically nifty judicial trickery, finding a different basis for habeas corpus - one rooted in federal law rather than the constitution - which the earlier case had not thought to explore. It was this reasoning that particularly inflamed the three dissenting judges, William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, and caused the ninth member of the Bench, Justice Anthony Kennedy, to set out his own, rather different reasons for agreeing with the majority.</p>
      <p>Why did the supreme court, in the apt words of Scalia, Dick Cheney's shooting companion, spring "a trap on the executive, subjecting Guantanamo Bay to the oversight of the federal courts even though it has never before been thought to be within their jurisdiction - and thus making it a foolish place to have housed alien wartime detainees"?</p>
      <p>The first explanation probably lies in quite how extreme and egregious the administration's policy was, cutting the judiciary out completely in a way that was far worse than what had happened even after the second world war, and in the process making no concessions whatsoever to even the modest concerns of mainstream judicial opinion.</p>
      <p>In the Hamdi ruling, decided at the same time as the Guantanamo case, the majority of judges saw off the administration's claim to be able to hold "enemy combatant" US citizens indefinitely and without any due process. This time the majority was eight to one, with the usually reliably conservative Scalia, incongruously joined by the liberal Stevens, penning a remarkable and eloquent attack on administration policy. Only a patent political lackey on the bench could go as far as the executive demanded, and it is part of the wider ineptitude of the Bush presidency that it forced its friends into such a corner. When only the George Bush Sr-appointee Clarence Thomas is on your side you know you are in deep trouble.</p>
      <p>Second, and perhaps in these cases even more importantly, lurking in the shadows thrown by the legal analysis of the issues was the horror of Abu Ghraib. In the US, even strong supporters of the war on terrorism, and indeed of the Bush presidency, have been shocked by what the policy of torture, now clearly seen to have been instigated at the highest levels of the administration, says about the claim to hold people beyond the reach of the law. It no longer seems such a mystery why the authorities have been so keen to keep their prisoners from even a modicum of independent oversight. American legal culture, in the form of these supreme court justices, is not remotely near being so craven as to allow such conditions to continue, and unlike the state department and the decent mainstream military, by a happy quirk of constitutional history it can actually do something about it.</p>
      <p>Third, there is the increasingly evident emptiness of Bush's self- declared "war on terrorism". Of course the justices recognised that there have been atrocities and that they continue to occur, need to be prevented and, when they happen, to be punished. But to secure counter- terrorism powers on the basis of fighting a war is to require oneself to be disciplined by (as the court's opinion in the Hamdi case put it) an "understanding" which must be "based on long-standing law-of-war principles". Delivering that opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor then added a very significant rider: "If the practical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those of the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that understanding may unravel." True, speaking for the court, O'Connor then immediately added, "But that is not the situation we face as of this date," but the Bush team has been warned. This blank cheque may be about to bounce.</p>
      <p>These two judgments represent an important benchmark in the fight back against executive excess that has been initiated in the US and has also been evident here in the UK. It has always been quite wrong to equate the plight of the detainees under our Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act with those held in Guantanamo, but that does not mean that their detention without trial on an indefinite basis is not wholly wrong. It remains as cruel, unnecessary and as dangerous now as it was when first introduced. The alleged need for such effective internment was exposed by a coruscating report from a committee of distinguished privy counsellors at the end of last year. Perhaps emboldened by this report, the special court (SIAC) charged with overseeing our detention system has begun to flex its muscles.</p>
      <p>In October the whole discriminatory basis of our detention system, allowing only foreign nationals to be held but exempting the rest of us, will finally come to be reviewed by the House of Lords for compatibility with the Human Rights Act. As in the US, our post-September 11 anti- terrorism laws lapse: here it will be in November 2006. In the absence of a sharp upsurge in terrorist violence, there is room for cautious hope that the principles of civil liberties and respect for human rights have some moral mileage left in them.</p>
      <p>The last word deserves to be left with the US supreme court from its judgment on Hamdi delivered by one its most conservative members, Sandra Day O'Connor: "It is during our most challenging and uncertain moments that our nation's commitment to due process is most severely tested; and it is in those times that we must preserve our commitment at home to the principles for which we fight abroad." Let us hope the law lords - and law lady - are listening.</p>
      <p>Conor Gearty is professor of human rights law and director of the Centre for the Study of Human Rights at LSE, and a member of Matrix Chambers. He will speak tonight, with attorney general Lord Goldsmith and solicitor general Harriet Harman, at a Society of Labour Lawyers public meeting on Fighting Terror and Preserving Human Rights, at 6.30 in committee room 6 at the House of Commons.</p>

      <p>It was at this time, six years ago almost to the day, that a massive upheaval began in my life. Over the following months, there was to be a change in "important relationship", house, country and career. I was to give up a familiar existence in north London, where I lived with my two grown-up sons, for a foreign country and a home that was little more than a ruin.</p>
      <p>For 13 years, I had been garden editor of a glossy magazine, and for nine I had been in a dwindling relationship with an elusive man who lived on the other side of London. Somehow, life in the city had become grim. Weather, architecture, people and work all seemed to lack sparkle, and it was after a distinctly unscintillating Christmas that I dragged one of my adult sons to the south of Spain with a hazy notion of buying something very cheap, installing a sink, and jetting there to escape whenever it took our fancy.</p>
      <p>We patrolled our chosen area - inland but within striking distance of the sea, among beautiful mountains, and less than an hour from an airport - and immediately fell in love with a ruined Andalusian finca, 40 minutes north of Malaga. "No point in even looking at it," the agent had said. "It needs a lot of work, a lot of money spent." But that was like a red rag to a bull. Within minutes of clapping eyes on this wreck, we had slapped down a deposit.</p>
      <p>The finca was a chaotic jumble of little rooms - 15 including those that had once housed horses, donkeys, pigs and goats. It had been built apparently at random on a sloping site, and had metre-thick walls, holes in the roof twice as big as the tiny windows, low ceilings and pebble floors. It had snakes, rats, mosquitoes and geckos, but there was a wonderful sense of space - wide views of the hills on three sides, and olive and almond trees on the slope behind. I had never before visited a hot country in winter, and the lush green of the fields was a revelation, reminiscent of western Ireland bu with brilliant sunlight, which I naively assumed to be constant.</p>
      <p>We returned once more during that week, this time with a measuring tape, a notebook and a local builder, Juan, with whom we explored the wilder shores of body language, being ignorant of such Spanish words as water tank, roof and sink. Juan advised complete demolition and total reconstruction - advice that I airily ignored. Later, though, as we all downed rioja at Paco's bar in the village, my son and I found ourselves warming to the idea of raising ceilings, widening doors, enlarging windows, altering the layout and, in short, demolishing and rebuilding. At the back of my mind another vision was taking shape, involving selling my London house, leaving my job, and living full time in Andalusia. Perhaps, a shy voice whispered in my head, I could write the books I wanted to write.</p>
      <p>That might have been enough major life changes to be getting on with, but the most momentous was awaiting me in London. As I walked into my house, the phone was ringing. It was Dan Pearce, a painter, asking me out for dinner. We had met through mutual friends three months earlier and, though it always gave me a thrill to bump into him, I'd not considered taking it further. I was too busy trying to breathe life into the moribund relationship with the man from SW13. Dan had none of the attributes I had hitherto considered essential in my choice of partner: he was not a time-pressed, irascible, type-A personality with a job that mattered more than life. Instead, he was charming, clever and good-looking, of no fixed career, and it took less than half a pizza for me to realise he was right for me.</p>
      <p>Dan was also up for a complete change, and ready to leap into the Spanish adventure with me. He spent months planning the layout of the house, fountains and gardens with extraordinary vision - a result, I suppose, of a lifetime spent drawing and sculpting. It all made me very suspicious (I was convinced that such a seeming paragon had to be a complete cad) and it was only after living with him for three years or so that I relaxed slightly.</p>
      <p>From that first deposit six years ago, we were stalled until the summer of 1998, when Dan came into enough money to start building. Worse, it took two years (thanks to various hitches) to sell my London home, so for the first 18 months of building work, I commuted to my London job one week in four, while Dan bravely elected to inhabit the Spanish site permanently. For months there was no phone, no running water, bathroom, lavatory, kitchen, electricity or privacy.</p>
      <p>During that first summer, showering involved hauling water from a crumbling holding tank, letting it warm up in a plastic bag in the sun, then hanging it from a branch or doorjamb and washing under it. Cooking was on a camping gas stove.</p>
      <p>Our priorities were bold. First of all, we built a circular swimming pool where the threshing floor had been. This was followed in early autumn, by the bathroom, way over at the other end of the site. Whenever we had money, we demolished and replaced rooms - doing exactly what Juan had recommended, but taking a slower, more complicated and far more expensive route. There were moments of wild celebration - electricity! Running water! A proper kitchen! But there would be lengthy lulls when we ran out of money, with the result that the whole operation took about four years. I finally gave up my job in spring 2000, joining Dan permanently among the almond blossom and cement mixers.</p>
      <p>We eventually had three glorious, large rooms at the northern end and three bedrooms, a sitting room and kitchen in a separate bit at the southern end for family and visitors. By the time the builders left, nothing remained of the original house bar one short, thick stretch of wall.</p>
      <p>At last, in March 2001, the last turquoise tessera was added to the fountain in the courtyard, and the builders packed up and left us to our finished house. In the strange silence that followed, we discovered what a convenient diversion the building work had been. Now, nothing stood between us and our ambitions: Dan had his studio and expectant canvasses, I had my study and computer. Nothing but gross idleness could now keep us from achieving the things we'd babbled about</p>

      <title>Premier League 2017-18 previews No6: Crystal Palace</title>
      <subtitle>Frank de Boer has taken over from Sam Allardyce intent on providing some longevity in the role and has already got the process of rejuvenation under way at a club who are entering their record fifth successive season in the top flight</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Guardian writers' predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Dominic Fifield's prediction but the average of our writers' tips)</p>
      <p>Last season's position 14th</p>
      <p>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 750-1</p>
      <p>Crystal Palace are in uncharted territory. A glance at the standings over the past few seasons suggests they are closer to feeling established in the top flight than ever, even if each of those mid-table finishes disguises an occasionally fraught campaign complete with prolonged flirtations with relegation.</p>
      <p>Regardless, never before has this club enjoyed a fifth successive campaign among the elite. More to the point, in Frank de Boer they have appointed a manager of status charged with making them feel they truly belong.</p>
      <p>There is risk involved in this team's pursuit of progression. Alan Pardew had attempted to transform a side whose forte was counterattacking effervescence into a more possession-based team. Those intentions were well-meaning and born of long-term vision, that desire to evolve, but results suggested their implementation was far from smooth.</p>
      <p>A miserable calendar year in 2016 had Palace turning to Sam Allardyce, a Red (and blue) Adair, in search of salvation. Survival was eventually achieved by heavy mid-season investment in the squad and a willingness to fall back upon more rugged qualities: tapping into the pace and skill of Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend on the flanks, the organisational inspiration of Mamadou Sakho at the back, the intelligent industry of Luka Milivojevic in central midfield, and Christian Benteke's powerful presence up front.</p>
      <p>Yet the startling results under Allardyce over the run-in - the improbable victories at Stamford Bridge and Anfield, and a thumping first home success over Arsenal in the league in 38 years - could not entirely erase the memory of what had been, until then, a miserable campaign.</p>
      <p>It is hard to forget the chaotic losses to Swansea, homeand away. Likewise those against Burnley, home and away, and the thrashing dished out by Sunderland, such a mess of a Premier League team, in early February as the atmosphere turned poisonous inside Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Palace lost 21 of their 38 league games, with most of those defeats inflicted at home. Allardyce would have set about improving that record only for a traumatic year to catch up with him.</p>
      <p>De Boer, appointed after an exhaustive recruitment process, is an exciting alternative; an intriguing addition to the Premier League but a man who will attempt to instigate improvement and transition in a new and brutal division.</p>
      <p>Understandably there may be teething troubles ahead, but the Dutchman does appear galvanised by the challenge. "If Palace sign me they know they are going to see something different," he said after his team's participation in the Premier League trophy in Hong Kong. "They don't want last season's football. Again, great respect for Sam, I would have done the same. I have a lot of respect for Sam. He saved them. But we want something different. He was playing a system to survive. Now we have to be a solid club and take the next step. If we are complacent, we can't do it."</p>
      <p>De Boer, who had steered Ajax to four successive domestic titles after a six-year drought, feels he is a better manager for the chastening experience at Internazionale, where a three-year contract was ripped up by the club's Chinese owners after 85 days.</p>
      <p>Certainly the 47-year-old is approaching the task ahead with a welcome degree of realism. He had previously acknowledged that striding into the training centre in Beckenham and merely imposing Ajax's approach as the blueprint overnight would be footballing "suicide".</p>
      <p>Nor does he appear intent upon abandoning all semblance of defensive solidity in pursuit of a slicker, more lavish attacking style. The Premier League has a habit of exposing wide-eyed idealists, and solidity is required. "At Ajax, my team always conceded fewest goals," he said. "I am good at [coaching] that, and hopefully we can see that at Crystal Palace. We do it all step by step. It starts there."</p>
      <p>It is hard to judge whether achieving the end game - which would surely be an upper-mid-table finish achieved with more of the ball - is realistic, and judgment should be reserved at the very least until the closure of the transfer window.</p>
      <p>The games in Hong Kong, where Palace were outpassed by Liverpool but, in periods, looked threatening in victory over West Bromwich Albion, exposed a squad adjusting to new tactical demands. De Boer will know better now whether mainstays of the previous regimes - Damien Delaney, Scott Dann, Martin Kelly and Joel Ward - have it in them to adapt and thrive.</p>
      <p>The fact the manager is intent upon adding new recruits across the backline would suggest rejuvenation is under way. That process began with the arrival of Jaïro Riedewald, a ball-playing defender from Ajax, and will be maintained in the pursuit of Bruno Martins Indi or Calum Chambers.</p>
      <p>A hefty wage bill may need to be trimmed, too, to grant the recruitment department more leeway in the market, particularly after the vast expenditure of January. The last month of the window is likely to prove frantic, with incomings and outgoings: Palace have lost one goalkeeper in Steve Mandanda (who has returned to Marseille) and are seeking a replacement (Adrián at West Ham United is an option they may pursue), are short of back-up to Benteke, and will target another wide forward and a right wing-back who can operate in the manager's favoured 3-4-3.</p>
      <p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek is an intriguing addition, though he must thrive as a loanee from Chelsea where Patrick Bamford and Loïc Rémy sank without trace. If the young midfielder proves he has the pedigree most believe he possesses, England senior recognition is not outlandish.</p>
      <p>Yet, for all the hard work still to be undertaken, there is a mood of optimism around the set-up. De Boer and his coaching staff, Orlando Trustfull and Alessandro Schoenmaker, have made a favourable impression. Sammy Lee - whose contribution to the success eventually enjoyed under Allardyce should not be underestimated - adds some Premier League nous, while Ryland Morgans has also been retained on the staff. They provide continuity of sorts. Securing Zaha, an attacking player of such rare talent, to a new long-term deal even before the managerial appointment, can be considered a coup, and the hope is the coaching staff can eke consistency from a squad which has some pedigree, particularly in forward areas.</p>
      <p>Achieve all that and De Boer - a manager chosen in the hope he might provide some longevity in the role - may actually succeed in providing what Palace require most of all from their most protracted stint in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Retaining Premier League status has been the be-all and end-all over the past four years, an understandable objective given the vast amounts of income associated with life in the elite and the implications of slipping back from whence they came. But, at some stage, this club needs to start work on creating a legacy from this stint in the top division.</p>
      <p>The redevelopment of Selhurst Park has stumbled on planning and political obstacles that Ron Noades would have considered infuriatingly familiar in the mid-1990s. Then there is the academy, the club's pride and joy in financially tighter years, which remains housed in a Goals centre across the road from the training ground. De Boer, steeped in all things Ajax, arrived talking up the prospect of giving youth a chance, but achieving Category One status is a pipe dream while everything seems so temporary.</p>
      <p>The chairman, Steve Parish, is acutely aware of the need to evolve off as well as on the pitch. The hope is that, under the new manager, both progressions can be undertaken in tandem. Those are ambitious plans. An interesting campaign awaits.</p>

      <title>The Full English: Part Five: Great things to do in 10 minutes, an hour, a day, a week: ENGLAND WEEK: Walking on water: Just 147 square miles, the Isle of Wight is one of England's smallest counties, but as Lesley Gillilan discovers, there's plenty to explore - Correction Appended</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Over bacon and eggs at a communal breakfast in our Mottistone farmhouse B&amp;B, we began our mornings on the Isle of Wight finding out how best to spend the rest of the day. "What are the must dos?" I asked our six fellow guests. Osborne House (Queen Victoria's elaborate holiday home at East Cowes), they all agreed, is one of them. Carisbrooke Castle, comes a close second. Yarmouth is pretty. Victorian Ventnor is charmingly time-warped - and the town's Hambrough hotel-restaurant has just won the island's first Michelin star. Oh, yes, and Freshwater Bay's Dimbola museum - former home of sepia-portrait photographer, Julia Margaret Cameron - is worth a visit. It has a nice collection of images from the early Isle of Wight pop festivals.</p>
      <p>The Needles? Yes, definitely do the Needles. But you must walk there. In fact, the general consensus was to walk pretty much everywhere. One couple had the blisters to prove it. They could have strolled up to the Needles from the car park at Alum Bay, but, no, they picked up the 14-mile Tennyson Trail from somewhere in the middle of Brighstone Forest and walked the entire way.</p>
      <p>The Isle of Wight is said to have more walks per square mile than anywhere else in the UK. With some 500 miles of way-marked routes, the place is a spaghetti-junction of field tracks, cycle-ways and bridleways, weaving over chalk downs, along high heather-clad ridges, through woodland, farmland and Mediterranean gardens, and always, ultimately, to the sea. In this motorway-free island county - 23 miles across by 13 down - there are more footpaths than roads. Given time, and a bit of gumption, you could yomp around the entire island. People do.</p>
      <p>We arrived too early for today's Autumn Walking weekend (23-26 October); and six months too soon for the annual Walking Festival in May (with 300 walks, it's the biggest event of its kind in the UK). But you don't really need events to get you going. A handy little guide, Coastal Path and Inland Trails on the Isle of Wight, gave us all the low-down, the maps, the routes, the mileage. In essence, there are eight inland trails (Shepherds, Hamstead, the Freshwater Way etc) and one 67-mile coast path, divided into six manageable chunks. There are dozens of other, more secretive paths, veering off the main drags. Most are mapped and signposted. And if you get lost, just ask - on an island of keen walkers, almost everyone seems to know their way around.</p>
      <p>On arrival, our National Trust B&amp;B hosts, Richard and Yvonne, spread out a well-used OS map, traced fingers along dotted lines, explaining trails and sub-trails, things to do on the way, buses to catch on the way back (there was a bus stop right outside). As a taster, we followed Richard and his energetic labrador out of their front door, and straight on to a path that climbs up through woodland, around the Longstone (a megalithic sandstone monolith) and up onto an elevated stretch of the Worsley Trail. From here, like many high points on the island, you can see both coasts: to the south the English Channel, to the north the Solent, the latter dotted with sails, and Wightlink ferries chugging out of Portsmouth Harbour.</p>
      <p>We began our self-guided Wight walkathon with the well-trodden route from the lofty cliff-top outlook at St Catherine's Hill - the island's most southerly point - up to Hoy Monument on St Catherine's Down. It was a park-and-ride kind of walk; leave the car, puff our way uphill for an hour or so and back down again. But it was rich in sights: the views, the monument (a slender column erected by William Hoy to celebrate the Russian Tsar Alexander's visit to Britain in 1814); then St Catherine's Oratory, or "the Pepper pot", a stone-built, 14th-century lighthouse; and finally on the hill, back where we started, a glimpse of Blackgang Chine, a "fantasy theme park", set in Victorian gardens in an eroding coastal ravine overlooking Chale Bay. We could hear the screams of riders on the Cliff Hanger rollercoaster below.</p>
      <p>From Blackgang, you can walk along 12 miles of flat, exposed coastal path - following the Napoleonic Military Road, along unstable Jurassic cliffs, to the sandy, surfy beach at Brook Bay where white-chalk tracks continue up and over Compton Down to Freshwater. We didn't walk, we drove; stopping frequently to admire the views or, at one point, to take a quick look at Brighstone Holiday Centre, a curious cliff-top community of 1930s holiday chalets, last up-graded in the 1950s. Popular with bikers, surfers and fashion photographers, it recently gained heritage status.</p>
      <p>The Isle of Wight's heritage also includes dinosaur fossils, Roman mosaics (in the villa at Brading) and Tudor castle, but one of its USPs is its quaintly retro nature: the sort of place that does winceyette nighties displayed behind yellow sun shades in the windows of Victorian shops, a lot of hand-written signs, Morris Minors and corrugated iron chapels in little thatched villages with tea rooms and post offices (at Brook, the latter is housed in a Portakabin tucked behind a hedge).</p>
      <p>Next, we tackled the final, four-mile leg of the West Wight classic, the Tennyson Trail - a homage to the Victorian poet who, during 40 years on the island, took a daily constitutional from his home in Freshwater Bay. His lordship must have been as fit as a flea, because the climb up to Tennyson Monument on Tennyson Hill, is a long slow slog, though when you get to the top you can see why he bothered. Looking west along the tail of land at the island's south-western tip, the view is sensational. You can see as far as Dorset.</p>
      <p>Another two miles on, and we reached the Needles Batteries, two 19th-century coastal forts: the new (used until 1971 to test space rocket engines), and the old (built in 1863, it's 20 years older). Aside from tunnels, battlements and cannons, the Old Battery is the best place on the island to see the white chalk stacks they call the Needles - the Isle of Wight's iconic geological landmark.</p>
      <p>Below, a ten-minute walk downhill is Alum Bay, home to the tacky Needles Park, of which the only saving grace is distant views of the Needles from a mini chairlift that rattles down a cliff to the bay's coloured sands.</p>
      <p>Other walks on our radar included the Sandown-Shanklin-Ventnor route, a six-mile stretch of path that links the Isle of Wight's three south-coast seaside resorts; taking in Shanklin Chine (a mossy ravine garden with waterfalls, red squirrels and illuminations) and Bonchurch (leafy seaside village with pond, pottery and oak-lined gorge). Our only north-coast walk was a stroll around the Newtown Nature Reserve, a watery basin of creeks, lakes and salt marsh, spidering away from the Newtown River between Yarmouth and Cowes. And our favourite? Ventnor to the Botanic Gardens -</p>
      <p>one of the greenest, prettiest corners of the island's south coast.</p>
      <p>Tucked under Boniface Down, the island's highest point, Ventnor has the air of a colonial hill station, with terraces of Victorian houses overlooking a traditional English seafront. We hung out on the beach licking a Minghella ice cream (made by the family of local lad, Anthony Minghella) before hitting the grassy path that follows the Undercliff west to Steephill Cove. Here, just a mile into the walk, we stopped for a sandwich at Wheelers Crab Shed; part of a tiny shanty-town village of deck chairs, lobster pots, fishing boats and a salty collection of maritime shacks, all arranged around a tiny sandy bay, and mostly owned by the same shell-fishing family. Sadly, we were too late to catch the last of Wheelers' speciality: homemade, fresh-crab pasties.</p>
      <p>Above the cove, the Botanic Garden lies in 22-acres of lush plants, on the site of the now-demolished 19th-century sanatorium, the Royal National Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. After walking through its shaded, meadowy greens we rejoined the footpath, which continues along the coast to St Lawrence before heading inland, along the top of the Undercliff - missing the ornate wedding-cake lighthouse at St Catherine's Point. When we returned, by car, to have a proper look, I asked a passing local why this stretch of coast path doesn't follow the shoreline. "Landslips," he said simply. "And the blue slipper." The latter, he explained is a type of clay which, when wet, is slippery and dangerous.</p>
      <p>"Here for the weekend?" he asked. "No, we've got a whole week." I said. He shook his head. "Not nearly enough time." Indeed, the charms of Bemridge, Rye and the Solent coast will have to wait until next time.</p>
      <p>MORE ISLAND ESCAPES</p>
      <p>LUNDY ISLAND</p>
      <p>Like a chunk of Exmoor, adrift in the Bristol Channel, Lundy is a windswept granite outcrop, ten miles off the mainland. There are no roads (other than the harbour track), no cars (except tractors and Landrovers), lots of rabbits, sheep and, occasionally, puffins, and absolutely nothing to do except hiking, diving, bird-watching or looking at the stars. Three miles long and half a mile wide, the island is run by the Landmark Trust, and has a pub, church, three lighthouses, a medieval castle built by Henry III and a collection of self-catering cottages (including one of the lighthouses). Access is by boat via Bideford or Ilfracombe or, in winter, by helicopter from Hartland Point. landmarktrust.org.uk.</p>
      <p>ISLES OF SCILLY</p>
      <p>Walking heaven, this: Five inhabited islands (among dozens of rocky islets), 28 miles south-west of Land's End, all trimmed with white shell sand, lapped by shallow seas the colour of the Caribbean, traced with footpaths and sprinkled with wild flowers. And four of them (Tresco, St Martins, St Agnes and Bryher) are easily circumnavigated on foot in a day. St Martins is the best for beaches, Tresco for sub-tropical gardens and dinky St Agnes for a get-away-from-it-all. Reach them by boat from St Mary's, the largest of the islands, but don't be in a hurry to leave. St Mary's, too, is a jewel of an island. If you don't feel like walking, grab a bike: a day's hire will get you round the island - three or four times. simplyscilly.co.uk.</p>
      <p>LINDISFARNE</p>
      <p>Also known as Holy Island, Lindisfarne hangs off the coast of Northumberland, and is accessible at low tide via the three miles of causeway that crosses Holy Island Sands. The danger of being cut off by the North Sea is, perhaps, part of the island's romance, but it has, for centuries, been a place of pilgrimage thanks to the ruins of Lindisfarne Priory - one of the crucibles of early English Christianity. Visit Lindisfarne Castle, which sits atop a crag of rock looking magical at sunset; mill around the village doing the tourist thing (heritage centre, tea rooms, Celtic crafts) or do a spot of seal-watching while sitting among up-turned herring boats on the wild and often windy harbour beach. lindisfarne.org.uk</p>
      <p>Correction</p>
      <p>*A reader was surprised when a piece about an Isle of Wight walking holiday looked forward to returning to sample the charms of Bemridge, Rye and the Solent coast: "Rye is in East Sussex and I don't believe that there is a Bemridge anywhere in the UK. Ryde and Bembridge are well worth visiting however!" (Walking on water, 24 October, page 10, The Full English).</p>

      <title>The Redfern All Blacks at the Koori Knockout - brutal rugby league that brings a community together</title>
      <subtitle>The annual tournament in NSW stands for family, loyalty and an immense mutual respect between the young ones, celebrity players and elders</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Isaac's weekly routine is typical of any 14-year old kid. School from Monday to Friday means fooling around with mates, talking to girls, avoiding homework and occasionally getting into trouble with the teachers. He got a Saturday job in May, a "busy and boring" task of washing dishes at a cafe. Undoubtedly, the highlight of the year has been footy. In March, Isaac joined the Redfern All Blacks, in August they won the South Sydney Juniors Under-15s grand final, and over the October long weekend, he represented the All Blacks at his first Koori Knockout.</p>
      <p>Isaac's Under-15s were eliminated before the semi-finals, but it was a triumphant long weekend at Knockout for the Redfern All Blacks. The women's side won their grand final, and the mens senior side won 36-32 in a cliffhanger over the Newcastle All Blacks.</p>
      <p>Redfern All Blacks are the oldest and best known Aboriginal sporting club in Australia, while the Koori Knockout is the largest Aboriginal sporting event of the year. There is the Murri Carnival held over the same weekend in Queensland, but the Knockout is the largest gathering of Aboriginal people anywhere in the country. Established with just five clubs in 1971, it has grown to over 100, and an estimated 20,000 men, women and children made the pilgrimage to Dubbo, Wiradjuri country, for the 45th iteration of what many describe as "the modern corroboree".</p>
      <p>For as long as he can remember, Isaac wanted to play Knockout footy. His first taste was in 2009, in his mother's country, Bundjalung. "I been to one in Tweed Heads, but that was years ago," he says. "I reckon it's a good idea, 'cos like you see all these other teams, all these other Kooris."</p>
      <p>Family ties Isaac to rugby league. His mother, Deslyn, was selected for the NSW touch footy squad before she fell pregnant with Isaac, and his father, Lawrie, rose through the grades in Sydney and played Knockout every year without fail. Mostly he played for Griffith Three Ways, and there was one year that he played for the Redfern All Blacks. This year, however, he's in prison - one of the brothers behind bars.</p>
      <p>Like most mothers, Deslyn was worried about how her son would handle the roughness of Knockout footy. "He wasn't supposed to go until his dad could take him - to look after him," she says. There used to be a revered prison team called "Brothers" in the Knockout, but not anymore, and so Deslyn bent her rule to allow Isaac to play.</p>
      <p>Lawrie's reputation precedes him, and Isaac has heard all about his father's exploits. "I think he always used to get sent off for doing dangerous stuff," he says. "He threw punches, big tackles. He's a good fighter, and everybody's scared of him. No one mucks around with him."</p>
      <p>You can hear the love and admiration that Isaac has for his dad in the tone of his voice, and in the way he holds himself. Neither of them are big talkers, but then again, they don't need to be. At 14, Isaac's already a big guy, and handsome too. Six foot tall, 80kg, size 12 footy boots, dark eyes and a brooding gaze - a spitting image of Lawrie as a teenager. Isaac wears his South Sydney Rabbitohs jumper everywhere, a black cap, and soon, when his dad says he's ready, he'll move from the lighter weights to the bench-press.</p>
      <p>Lawrie has never seen Isaac play rugby league, but he's keeping tabs on his son from afar. They write letters back and forth, and over the phone Lawrie gives him regular tips on how to handle himself on the field. "He tells me if I can put down the biggest player on the team, then people will start to know me," explains Isaac. Earlier in the season, Isaac was sin-binned for flipping a huge forward on his back, an age-old rite of passage for any teenage second-rower. "It's not as hard as I thought it would be, hey," he says happily.</p>
      <p>After a Wiradjuri welcome, the 2015 Koori Knockout was officially opened by the NSW Deputy Opposition Leader, Linda Burney, a Wiradjuri woman from Whitton. "Please stand out of respect for our elders past and present, and for all our brothers that can't be here with us today," she asked the crowd at Caltex Park. "This weekend in Queensland and NSW, there are over 200 Aboriginal teams playing rugby league. And whatever happens tomorrow, at the [NRL] grand final, there's gonna be a blackfella holding up the NRL. Either Johnathan [Thurston] or Justin [Hodges] - there's going to be an Aboriginal person holding up that cup."</p>
      <p>It has been a standout year for Aboriginal rugby league. The Dally M awards were a blackout - Thurston took out the best player, Ash Taylor the best Under-20s player and Jenni-Sue Hoepper the best female player. When North Queensland Cowboys captain Thurston lined up the last-minute conversion in Sydney with scored locked at 16-16, commentator Peter Sterling noted that "the amount of people willing this over is astronomical". A particularly high concentration of those people were out in Dubbo, having watched a full day of games at the Knockout. Thurston may be a Queenslander, but he's adored by every Koori regardless of whitefella borders.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Dubbo also spoke at the opening ceremony of the special partnership between the council and the host team, Walgett Aboriginal Connections. This in itself is a significant progression - when Dubbo first hosted the Knockout in 1984, the Daily Liberal local newspaper spoke of an "influx" of Aboriginal people, and after some trouble in town, ran sensationalised stories and provocative headlines. Tit-for-tat arguments broke out between white and black residents, with the former mayor accusing Knockout fans of not respecting Dubbo's "hospitality".</p>

      <p>Heidi Norman, author of AnUnwanted Corroboree: The Politics of the New South Wales Aboriginal RugbyLeagueKnockout wrote that in 1984, "Newspaper coverage attributed the 'crime wave' to Aboriginal people, who were never personified as locals, visitors, tourists or even football fans; their only identity was as a threat."</p>
      <p>Aboriginal people are Australia's most watched group. Whether in big cities or rural areas whitefellas watch blackfellas out of fear, curiosity and for entertainment, sometimes all at once. The closest whitefellas get to watching blackfellas out of love or affection is on the sporting field, and even then it's usually because they are helping a white team win.</p>
      <p>The Knockout is not like that. You can feel the love reverberate around the ground, it's "cuz" that, "sista" this and "brutha" there. NITV and ABC commentator Brad Cooke describes the kaleidoscope of colour as a washing machine, "a load of coloured clothing representing the bright colours of the jerseys and supporter gear worn by the community all mixed in together".</p>
      <p>It's tribe on tribe, an all-black sporting and cultural conversation where First Nations are celebrated, friends are formed, new babies are conceived and old scores are settled. A few years back, there was a brutal, 300-man brawl between Moree Boomerangs and La Perouse Panthers. La Perouse on Botany Bay was the site of first contact between the British and Aboriginal people, and the Panthers get the same taunt from every side they come up against: "You let Captain Cook in."</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Cronulla Sharks pair Andrew and David Fifita played for Griffith Three Ways against the St. George forward George Rose and his brothers at Walgett Aboriginal Connections. The first half was basically a rolling brawl with flashes of footy played in between, as scuffles broke out in every set of six tackles. The Koori Knockout attracts too many first grade and reserve grade players to name, at least one in almost every team. There is something exhilarating and surreal about watching highly-paid professional players break their contracts to scrap and snarl at one another in 38 degree heat. Watch these gladiators battle on hard grounds under hot sun and you soon realise their communities are far more important than any NRL side could ever be.</p>
      <p>If South Sydney Rabbitohs are the heart of Redfern, the All Blacks are the soul</p>
      <p>The raw brutality is an essential part of the event, but although the fights can be wild, it is all handshakes and backslaps at final whistle. When Isaac's team lose their second game after a heroic comeback that fell just short, the first thing both sides do is form a huddle for the other team. From his perch, the Godfather of the Knockout, Sol Bellear, is always there on the PA system, his smooth baritone voice a calming influence and a reminder that the elders must always be respected.</p>
      <p>Bellear goes to Knockout on official business, but he also represents the Redfern All Blacks. Truth is, it's hard to separate the Knockout from the All Blacks - they were there at the beginning in 1971, and the've won a record number of Knockouts. If you count the Redfern-based Cec Patten-Ron Merritt Memorial side from 2003-2006 - as Uncle Chicka Madden does - it brings their tally to 10.</p>
      <p>Uncle Chicka, 78, and his wife Aunty Lily are Redfern All Blacks personified. Uncle Chicka has never missed a Knockout since it began, and Aunty Lily has missed just one. "That's where I've got it over her!" laughs Uncle Chicka. They both hail from northern NSW, but their families came to Redfern in the post-war period looking for work. Uncle Chicka can still remember where he first met Aunty Lily in 1962, at Palms Milk Bar on Regent Street, Redfern.</p>
      <p>"What people have gotta remember about Redfern, it was the industrial hub of Australia," says Uncle Chicka. "All the industry was situated around Redfern, Waterloo, Alexandria, even out to Mascot, you know. When the Aboriginals, the Kooris in the bush, finished school and were looking for work they wouldn't get a job in the shop there or the council. If they got lucky they might get a job on the railway or the station in town. If they wanted a steady income they'd come to Sydney, because that's where all the industry was."</p>
      <p>Just like Isaac, Uncle Chicka is a mad South Sydney Rabbitohs fan, and like Isaac he got his first job at 14 and started playing for the All Blacks. For work, he cut timber and toiled in factories, and by 1973 became secretary of the club. During this period, Redfern was the epicentre of the Aboriginal Black Power movement, as blackfellas took control of their advancement organisations and agitated for land and citizenship rights. Toni Madden, the daughter of Uncle Chicka and Aunty Lily, was the first female patient at the Aboriginal Medical Service, and to this day she works there alongside Nathan Merritt, South Sydney legend and current star of the Redfern All Blacks senior team.</p>
      <p>Back in the sixties and seventies the All Blacks were subject to the same suspicion as the other Aboriginal self-help organisations. In 1962, an ASIO file on the Redfern All Blacks noted that "this club is an affiliate of the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement which is now under the influence from the Communist Party of Australia."</p>
      <p>One of these black radicals was Ken Brindle. In an essay for Dawn magazine in 1970, Brindle wrote that the club was "an expression of identity and visible proof that they can organise and manage their own affairs." This is an ongoing tradition that cannot be underestimated. "I've heard different people, different Kooris, say it was the first Aboriginal organisation," explains Uncle Chicka.</p>
      <p>If South Sydney Rabbitohs are the heart of Redfern, the All Blacks are the soul. At the 2014 NRL grand final in Sydney between Souths and Canterbury, Uncle Chicka was supposed to host the Welcome to Country ceremony. But he declined, because he had to be at Knockout with the All Blacks, and so his brother Allen did it instead. Nathan Merritt did the same, missing his retirement tribute at ANZ Stadium to be at Knockout. The club stands out as an enduring symbol, and in September, the senior team won their first South Sydney District grand final in 28 years. Coupled with the Under-15s win and the Knockout victory, 2015 has been one of the best seasons on record.</p>
      <p>Uncle Chicka says there are two key aspects of Knockout footy: depth and draw. This year, Redfern All Blacks had both. They got a bye in the first round, and in their first game they won 40-0. With 20 minute halves in the early rounds, that's a point a minute. By the conclusion of their third game, they had racked up 138 points to four, steamrolling Walgett Dragons and Newcastle Emus before fighting for a tough win over the Original Boomerangs from Moree.</p>
      <p>The squad is full of top-quality players, some who could have made it to NRL, like Mark Hickey; others who have made it, like Eli Roberts, Jonathan Wright, Joshua Addo-Carr and the Robinson brothers Reece and Travis. Then there's those who have recently retired, like captain-coach Dean Widders, crowd favourite Merritt and the code-hopping hooker Brendan Williams. At 41, Williams is the All Blacks metronome, firing passes off both hands and sliding through gaps nobody else could see. Williams grew up on The Block in Redfern, played rugby union in Italy where they nicknamed him "Dingo", and learnt to speak fluent Italian. Uncle Chicka loves Brendan, but when asked who the best player he ever saw was, he pointed a finger straight at Reece Robinson. "His grandfather Eric Robinson played for South Sydney," he says. "He was the fastest."</p>
      <p>All weekend, Uncle Chicka fielded calls from Micky Mundine, the long-serving CEO of the Aboriginal Housing Corporation on The Block in Redfern, updating him on scores and standout performers. Micky's nephew, the great rugby league player-turned-boxer Anthony "Choc" Mundine, was in Dubbo, running the water for the Redfern All Blacks women's side. In the public eye Mundine might be brash and loud, but at Knockout he played a quiet supporting role, making sure the women were looked after in the hottest part of the day. That's the side of Mundine whitefellas don't often see, and that's why blackfellas love him. Mundine wore a grey "Straight Outta Redfern" t-shirt, and by the end of the day they were sold out.</p>
      <p>Indeed the gentrification of inner Sydney means that the Mundines, the Phillips and the Maddens are some of the last Koori families out of Redfern. Earlier this year, Ken Brindle's old place on The Block in Caroline Street - once listed as club headquarters in the All Blacks ASIO file - sold for just under $1 million. But Uncle Chicka and Aunty Lily won't leave. "Probably our kids and grandkids will live here too," says Uncle Chicka. "In the golden triangle, they call it."</p>
      <p>The club, just like the suburb, is going through an evolution. These days the committee is dominated by women, and the Redfern Local Area Commander, Luke Freudenstein, is the waterboy. Freudenstein has been a police officer in Redfern for seven years and run the water week in, week out for the All Blacks for the last five. Uncle Chicka points to the white doctors and lawyers like Fred Hollows and Hal Wooten that volunteered at the Aboriginal Medical and Legal Services when they first started up. Proof, he says, that whitefellas have a role to play in Aboriginal organisations.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people have got the wrong impression with the Redfern All Blacks," says Uncle Chicka. "It wasn't set up because there was all blackfellas in there. When Redfern all Blacks first started off on Redfern Hill, blackfellas used to drink there after work. They all got together, and when the football season was ready to start, all the blackfellas and whitefellas got together and had a yarn and said 'we should put a team in the juniors'.</p>
      <p>"They said, 'yeah, righto - what are we gonna call it?' They said it'll have to be Redfern something. Souths juniors supplied the jumpers, socks and shorts, and if you put your order in through the year, you could pick your colours and design your jumpers. What they gave them was a black jumper, black shorts, and blacks socks with a white top and a white collar. That's where the Redfern All Blacks got their name from."</p>
      <p>Freudenstein's work with the Redfern All Blacks is a stunning subversion of the usual police presence in Redfern. He's not in charge here, but Uncle Chicka reckons he gets the respect of all the community by putting in the effort. Isaac and his team-mates, all the younger boys, are growing up with a totally different perception of police thanks to Freudenstein. As Widders says: "Who would have thought that a person from Redfern police would put his heart and soul into the Aboriginal community, dig deep into his own pockets and come out here and sweat, burn all weekend, just for us boys."</p>
      <p>The Redfern All Blacks have got a way with words. The club song, "We Keep The Ball In Motion", must be one of the greatest footy songs anywhere. Like many of the original Redfern All Blacks players, the song migrated down from the now-defunct north coast Tweed All Blacks after the war (that's where the lyrics "just like a rolling ocean" come from). Uncle Chicka reckons it was introduced to Redfern by Archie Glass, one of the players who was there for the All Blacks first South Sydney District premierships in 1974. This means Isaac sings the same song as his great-grandmother's brother, Napier Paulson, who played with the original Tweed All Blacks.</p>
      <p>Before the open mens grand final between Redfern and Newcastle All Blacks on Monday afternoon, Uncle Chicka was invited into the dressing room by Freudenstein. Here is his warm, gentle speech to the players:</p>
      <p>My name's Chicka Madden. This is me 45th Knockout. I've been involved with a lot of your fathers and grandfathers, cousins over the years.</p>
      <p>The club has got a great tradition, won more Knockouts than any other team. I wish you all the best today boys, I know you've got the ability to do it, and carry on the legend of the RAB.</p>
      <p>Can you make this 11, for me?</p>
      <p>Hope I've got a few more left in me to follow youse, you know? But youse have been very impressive, youse are a great team, just make everyone in Redfern, and all your families proud of you today boys.</p>
      <p>You got the ability - let's take out number 11 hey?</p>
      <p>Brendan Williams was the first to embrace him as he left the dressing room, and one by one the others shook his hand and patted him on the back. It was a deeply emotional moment - the young stars were suddenly reminded of the importance of the task ahead of them.</p>
      <p>And they did win it for Uncle Chicka. A swashbuckling comeback had the scores level at 32-32 at full-time, with Shane Nolan scoring a last-minute penalty kick from halfway to send the match into extra time. NRL star Jonathan Wright, whose dad was one of the founders of the Knockout all those years ago, crossed over to win the match in golden point.</p>
      <p>In his post-match speech, Widders spoke directly to his team-mates. "To the young men of Redfern," he said, "I seen these young boys, the amount of respect that you boys continue to give me day in day out, the hard work that youse have put in, the times you boys have just sit and listen to all the things I say, and go onto the football field and do your best to do it - I can't thank youse enough, boys."</p>
      <p>A big part of this victory belongs to Widders. At one game against Mascot last season, he deliberately started the match with just nine players. The other 11 on the bench didn't show up to training on time, and so they were forced to watch their brothers struggle on without them. It's that sort of discipline has reaffirmed the respect for the RAB jersey.</p>
      <p>In Widders Uncle Chicka sees shades of Ambrose Morgan, the great captain-coach who led the All Blacks to a first premiership more than four decades ago. "You gotta have the young ones around," he explains, "but you've gotta have the old heads to keep 'em on track, you know." As kids, parents, wives and girlfriends milled onto the field to celebrate with the All Blacks, Uncle Chicka made a beeline for Williams. The first person to embrace Uncle Chicka in the dressing room was the first he embraced at full time. That, in a single moment, says all you need to know about the All Blacks and the Knockout: family, loyalty and an immense mutual respect between the young ones, the celebrity players and the elders. Long after Uncle Chicka and Aunty Lily pass away, Isaac's generation and the generations after them will grow up with the legend of the 2015 victory.</p>
      <p>Isaac watched the game with his mum and his little brother. Like most he left on the Sunday, but tuned in to NITV's live national coverage. His team were knocked out, but he's not one to dwell on results. He played well at a new position, shifting from second-row to centre, and he says this season has been more about meeting new friends at the club.</p>
      <p>Without great fanfare or full knowledge of the importance of his initiation, Isaac has entered two vital institutions of Koori life. There are a world of options open to him and his team-mates. Next year he starts Year 10, and then maybe university. "If I don't make it at footy, then I'll probably join the navy," he says. "It's a good opportunity to travel the world. I want to go up to Europe."</p>
      <p>Whatever he does, there will always be a place for him in Redfern thanks to the All Blacks. As Uncle Chicka has shown, you don't need to be the star player to play a vital part of the RAB family.</p>
      <p>By virtue of the Redfern All Blacks' victory, the Knockout is coming back to Redfern, the black capital of NSW. Isaac is already planning ahead. "I want to play again," he says. "Next year, dad will take me."</p>
      <p>The Redfern All Blacks 2015 Koori Knockout champions are: Eli Roberts, Joshua Addo-Carr, Jonathan Wright, Nathan Merritt, Kieran Vale, Kareel Phillips, Reegan Carr, Heath Fernando, Scott Lyons, Steven Walker, Steven Winters, Dean Widders, Jimmy Widders-Leece, Mark Hickey, Joshua Nolan, Brendon Williams, Tyler Troy Terare, Reece Robinson, Shane Nolan, Travis Robinson, Raymond Carr, Kyle Mundine, Rick Lyons, Matt Nixon, Matthew Hickey.</p>

      <title>Is France finally ready to choose Marine Le Pen as president?</title>
      <subtitle>Having sanitised the Front National's racist image, can the party's leader now clean up in a presidential election too close to call?</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Backstage at a rally in southern France in the early days of the presidential race, Marine Le Pen took a puff on the electronic cigarette that has replaced her two-packets-a-day tobacco habit. "I'm going to run a joyful campaign," she smiled.</p>
      <p>Le Pen wanted to soften her harsh image and "soothe" voters - she had posed for pictures hugging horses and pet kittens - but also to offer a hardline programme she believed would "reassure" a French population despairing of decades of mass unemployment and a persistent terrorist threat.</p>
      <p>The aim, as always for the far-right Front National founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 1972, was keeping France for the French. There would be a referendum to change the constitution so that "national priority" would be given to French people over non-nationals in jobs, housing and welfare. There would be another referendum to leave the European Union. Le Pen promised an immigration clampdown and a ban on religious symbols, including the Muslim headscarf, from all public places in France.</p>
      <p>Marine Le Pen, 48, is the closest she has ever been to the French presidency - with a chance of making it to the final run-off in an election that is impossible to predict. In the six-years since she took over the party from her father, she has steadily increased her party's vote in every local and European election. If her ex-paratrooper, Holocaust-denying, provocateur father was content to be ostracised as a protest vote, Marine Le Pen wants power and political office.</p>
      <p>Le Pen, controlled and image-conscious, has always a walked a tight line between denouncing the system and trying to be part of it. Her life has played out in the public eye ever since, aged six, she was photographed being tucked into bed in her bedroom that was incongruously wallpapered with her father's Front National election posters about fighting the "Marxist cancer". The Le Pen family dynasty was always something of a national soap opera, with the blonde clan living together - including the three Le Pen daughters well into their 30s - in a 19th-century manor house perched on a hill outside Paris, watched over by dobermans.</p>
      <p>But the troubled father-daughter bond - and the brutal public breaking of it - has hung over her presidential campaign. Marine Le Pen's election strategy has been to broaden her voter base by sanitising the party's image, moving it away from any racist, jack-booted and antisemitic imagery of the past. The problem was that Papa Le Pen felt left out. In 2015, he deliberately wrecked her plans by repeating the Holocaust denials that had landed him a series of convictions for hate-speech and contesting crimes against humanity. After a bitter public feud, she expelled him from the party. He publicly disowned her and they haven't spoken since.</p>
      <p>But the ghosts of the second world war persist in French politics. Marine Le Pen was asked on a radio programme this week about a major wartime roundup of Jews in Paris. She said France as a nation was not responsible, only "those who were in power at the time", sparking fury from Jewish organisations. Le Pen argued that modern France should not be locked in a permanent repentance and that the "real" France was Gen de Gaulle's Resistance not the "illegal" Nazi-collaborationist Vichy regime. "If you're trying to say Marine Le Pen is a Nazi, come out and say it but that will make everyone laugh to the rafters because it's simply not credible," her chief strategist, Florian Philippot, angrily told a chatshow host. Le Pen slammed what she called a pointless controversy.</p>
      <p>Marion Anne Perrene Le Pen - swiftly nicknamed Marine - was born west of Paris in 1968, the youngest of three daughters. Her father showed off his children in the press. But their home life was more disjointed than it seemed. In the Le Pens' first Paris apartment building, the children lived separately from their parents, in a flat upstairs with a nanny. Jean-Marie Le Pen and his wife, Pierrette Lalanne, would go off on holiday or long sailing trips around the world on their own, sometimes missing Christmas.</p>
      <p>It was only when the eight-year-old Marine woke up in her nightdress amids shards of glass and a blown-away bedroom wall after a bomb attack aimed at killing their father, that she realised her father's political role and the extent of hatred towards him. "As an eight year-old girl, I was suddenly made aware of death," she told me when she took over the Front National leadership. "But maybe that gave me a distance, a kind of armour, that's useful when you're aiming for positions of responsibility."</p>
      <p>The family surname was a burden - she recalled teachers at school referring to her sisters as "daughters of a fascist" - but she constantly stood up for her father. When in 1985, the paper Libération revealed that Le Pen Sr had engaged in torture during the Algerian war, he denied it and advised the teenaged Marine Le Pen to take the day off school. She refused and went in defending him.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, as he gained political prominence, Le Pen Sr commissioned a biography from a journalist who spent time at the family's manor house. One day, Marine, then 16, was surprised to find one of her older sisters waiting outside school. "Mum's gone," she said. Without telling anyone, Pierrette Lalanne had taken all her possessions and left with Le Pen's biographer to set up a new life. She didn't see or speak to her daughters for over 15 years. Marine, the youngest and most attached to her mother, was left alone with her distant and distracted father. She said she waited every day for some kind contact from her mother, but none came.</p>
      <p>"Marine Le Pen grew up in a very odd atmosphere, a family that appeared close but was actually very distant," said David Doucet, who co-authored a biography of her early years, La Politique Malgré Elle. "She lived almost 20 years without her mother. Her father hardly knew her. She was brought up by nannies and governesses, left to her own devices."</p>
      <p>A vicious, public divorce battle followed. Jean-Marie Le Pen rebuffed Lalanne's maintenance claims, saying she should work as a cleaner. For revenge, Lalanne posed naked in French Playboy scrubbing kitchen floors.</p>
      <p>Marine Le Pen occasionally accompanied her father out campaigning as a teenager as a way to spend time with him and win a little attention. But she didn't initially set herself up for a political career. She told me once: "My father says I'm like Obelix. I fell into the magic potion of politics when I was young." In fact, she had tried to escape the party by studying law. To make extra income beyond her law firm jobs, she worked for six years as a state-appointed, duty lawyer, defending illegal immigrants facing deportation. "They are human beings who have rights," she said recently in a TV interview. "We don't blame immigration policies on them. It's not their fault."</p>
      <p>At 30, she won her first role as regional councillor for the Front National in Henin-Beaumont, a depressed, former coal-mining town in the north, which she later made her political laboratory, a place to reinvent herself as a "defender of the people". She recognised that France's northern industrial belt, which had traditionally voted left, could turn to the Front National if the party stood not just against immigration, which remained its chief selling point, but for the victims of deindustrialisation and the financial crisis. "It used to be called her laboratory, but now it's the place she still has an apartment, the region I think she feels most at ease in," said Sébastien Chenu, who ran her northern campaign in the last regional elections. "She's easy to approach, that's why it works for her in the north. She likes the contact."</p>
      <p>Le Pen keeps her old friends close. "If anyone tried to betray her, they couldn't stick around," Chenu said. The Front National party funding corruption cases currently under investigation - including allegations of misusing European public funds to pay French party workers, or false-accounting in election funding - have seen some of Le Pen's closest childhood friends placed under formal investigation. They and the party deny all charges. But the cases showed how she had placed people she met at college in positions of trust.</p>
      <p>Le Pen protects her children from the public exposure she had a child. Twice married and divorced from men who were active in the Front National, she had three children in the space of one year - a daughter immediately followed by twins. Her current partner is the party deputy, Louis Aliot.</p>
      <p>She once described her feud with her father as "the hardest time of my life except childbirth" but hinted she expects him to call her if she wins the presidency. Le Pen Sr's idea of parenting was always about toughening up his daughter. When Marine Le Pen was 20, he took her to the morgue to see the corpse of a party figure killed in a car crash. When she asked why, he said: "I don't want the first dead person you see to be me."</p>
      <p>Marine Le Pen Potted profile</p>
      <p>Born: 5 August 1968</p>
      <p>Career: She was legal officer for her father's far-right Front National party before winning different councillor posts in Henin-Beaumont in the north and in Paris. Currently regional councillor for the northern region, Hauts-de-France. Member of the European parliament since 2004, where she co-heads the anti-EU grouping, Europe of Nations and Freedom - a bloc of rightwing nationalist parties.</p>

      <title>Wheels: Big daddy: The new Range Rover is so huge you can fit a bike in the back - and cycle it about</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Launching my brand-new, pale-green Range Rover, in all its incomparable enormity, down some of London's narrower and most peaceful side streets, I began to realise that this extraordinary car was getting a mixed press from fellow road users.</p>
      <p>People seemed to fall into one of two camps. There were those who took violently against the vehicle on sight, their antipathy expressed by looks of pitiless contempt, occasionally underscored by hand gestures of a vigorous nature. And then there were the people who really didn't like it.</p>
      <p>This, one sees, would be the price of sitting up so high that the only way to view the world is down your nose. And of driving a car that is six feet tall and the length of Yorkshire. A car, moreover, whose armour-plated front grille is, as it goes along with 2,440kg of precision-tooled metal behind it, aimed almost exactly at the height of most other drivers' heads.</p>
      <p>Little wonder, really, that in a busy urban setting, such as, for example, the car park at Sainsbury's in Balham, there appears to be something award-winningly obscene about the presence of a Range Rover. In the country, obviously, the vehicle sits as naturally as wellies or adultery. In the town, it's about as welcome as a gas leak.</p>
      <p>Yet Range Rovers have, like foxes, crept into urban areas in recent years, and in its newest incarnation the car seems to play to this development more fully than before. If you dropped the tailgate on a Range Rover in the past, you knew roughly what was likely to fall out: a litter of black labradors, a couple of empty bottles of Veuve Clicquot, the odd polo player, maybe his mistress, possibly his horse. Even now there's no reason to suspect that the vehicle's sales performance in the important Chinless Toffs sector is likely to fall away.</p>
      <p>At the same time, in this latest spruce redesign, with its ultra-modern light clusters and chase-me twin side air vents, the Range Rover has never looked less Parker Bowles and more Michael Owen. Its heart seems to be set at least as much on being a big lump of luxury automobile for rich young movers and shakers as it is on being a huntsman's outhouse.</p>
      <p>In 1970, when it was first produced, the Range Rover was out there on its own. Now the features that were once its unique selling point (high driving position, animal-friendly boot space) are everyone's idea of a good time and the car has cheaper competitors - lots of fizzy Japanese knock-offs in the main, but also the BMW X5 and the Mercedes-Benz ML500. (The Range Rover is itself an international hybrid these days: British built, with a BMW engine and an overseeing American parent company in Ford.)</p>
      <p>But the Range Rover is still the big daddy. It's not just the fact that you can get a full-size bike in the back; it's the fact that you can go for a ride on it once it's in there. One morning, armed with a pair of stout walking boots and a packet of sandwiches, I set off to comb the vehicle thoroughly for a CD changer. Alas, I was forced to call off the search when night closed in.</p>
      <p>You mount the car, rather than climb into it, which may partly explain the persistence of its appeal to horsey types. Except that no horse offers an interior as comfortable as the Range Rover's, which, in the sumptuousness of its fixtures and fittings, is up to five-star hotel standards. The clarity of the light and the freshness of the air at that height is quite intoxicating. It helps you understand why people go rock climbing.</p>
      <p>On country lanes, you can see a tractor coming before the farmer has even got out of bed. The long-range visibility, coupled with the presence of sensors at each of the car's corners, make it far more intimidating to look at than it is to drive. In fact, one is borne effortlessly aloft, floating on the car's kingly suspension as on a cloud, with the distant swoosh of the four-litre V8 engine ahead of you and, underneath you, the faint sound of your money draining out of the petrol tank at the rate of 17 miles to the gallon.</p>
      <p>My only quibble would be with the car's ground clearance. Eighteen centimetres may be enough to keep the bottom of the vehicle from getting scuffed in the country, but it's going to prove conservative in relation to some of the potholes that one is apt to encounter in London.</p>
      <p>Out of respect for the decent people at Land Rover who lent us the vehicle, I didn't take my Range Rover across any ploughed fields, attempt to hurdle it over any stiles or see if it would climb a vertical quarry wall. But I am aware that I could probably have done all of these things, and without so much as making the CD player skip. Assuming I could have found the CD player.</p>
      <p>The Range Rover will win you no friends in the city. But in the country it will win you any battle you need to fight. Indeed, if you were planning to annex a foreign country and were expecting a bit of local resistance, you couldn't pick a better car.</p>

      <title>THE RAP TRAP: Dr Dre helped pioneer hardcore hip-hop: violence against 'bitches', the love of guns and fast cars. Now a millionaire father-of-two, he says he's turned over a new leaf - all that gangsta stuff was just about marketing, pleasing the fans. So who is the Dre of today? And has he really managed to break free from his past?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>I'm on my way to meet Dr Dre, and I have a song in my head. It's called Fuck You, and in it Dre explains, in some detail, how he just wants "to fuck bad bitches". The streets of Los Angeles glare white in the midday sun. I struggle into the plush recording studio where Dre is working. We talk for a while about his latest album, Dr Dre 2001.</p>
      <p>He recorded it, he tells me, because he felt misunderstood. "People definitely had the wrong idea about me. A lot of people were saying I was a mean cat, I disrespected women, a lotta bullshit, a lotta nonsense."</p>
      <p>Can you blame them, I suggest, given your history of violence, an arrest record that makes for long, grim reading and a six-month prison sentence for parole violation. He reflects for a moment. "Of course I can't blame them, but I'm a different person today. I can't blame them, and that's why I wanted to do this album and present myself in a new light - the Dre of today."</p>
      <p>For the record, then, the Dre of today is a relaxed, good-humoured, 35-year -old husband and father of two. He would like very much to put the misdemeanours of youth behind him, and make songs that highlight his maturity and sensitivity. Songs such as Fuck You. Strangely, there is less contradiction here than might seem apparent.</p>
      <p>It was while serving a six-month sentence in a Pasadena jail that Dre realised he'd had enough of hardcore hip-hop. As a producer and performer, he helped create the violent, invective-filled genre of gangsta rap, selling around 40 million records in the process. But along the way - amid the parties and women and fast cars that also came with being Dr Dre - he'd lost touch with himself, Andre Young. And he was tired. "I just said, let me do a whole 180 with my life. I don't want to do any more negative hip-hop music, I can't be talking about bitches and ho's."</p>
      <p>After prison, he got married and recorded a compilation album, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, by unknown artists and producers. His contribution was a single track, Been There, Done That. In the wake of his jailhouse conversion, he now mocked rappers "who talk that hardcore shit coz that's all they worth". The album promised much. A fresh start for Dre and a career launch for the artists involved. It delivered neither. By commercial standards, the record sold acceptably. By Dre's measure, it was a woeful failure. "People were expecting 7-Up and they got water," he conceded. "I wasn't getting compliments from my fans." Rap critics began to suggest he'd lost his edge. He felt directionless and insecure. Finally, his wife gave him some advice. "She used to play my music before we even met, so she was like, 'You need to get back in there and get back on that hardcore shit.' It felt funny going in the studio talking about 'this bitch' and 'this ho' and how 'I fucked this girl' with a wife at home. But then, I have to look at it like entertainment, and I have a set fanbase, and there's certain things they want to hear. They wanna hear Dre be Dre."</p>
      <p>So Dr Dre 2001 delivers a well-established formula of hardcore rap to its audience. There are songs that fetishise guns and objectify women. Songs that celebrate marijuana use and low-rider cars. Despite this, it's not simply a return to Dre's gangsta past. It's a more complex, reflective album. Where most hardcore rap affects a stony-faced emotional detachment, 2001 is at its strongest when Dre shows himself to be vulnerable. "Real gangstas don't cry," he states on one song, "if that's the truth then I'm realising I ain't no gangsta." This is most notably so on The Message, a ballad that features the plaintive vocals of R&amp;B queen Mary J Blige and on which Dre mourns the death of his younger brother, Tyree, whose neck was broken in a fight three years ago. "Back in the day, I would never have made a song about my brother, but it was a very big part of my life, so I finally decided to give people that much more of me." Having tried unsuccessfully to divorce himself from what Dr Dre was, it seems he has chosen instead to broaden the possibilities of who Dr Dre can be. So much so that he gives me an indignant look when I refer to him as a gangsta rap artist, complaining that he doesn't "even know where the term gangsta rap came from. I think the media invented it. We never came out and said, 'Yo, what we do is gangsta rap'. What I make is hardcore hip-hop."</p>
      <p>It's easy to see why he insists on the distinction. Creatively, the music form never progressed far beyond an adolescent glee at its own ability to shock. Yet it's ironic, too. Because, as part of the rap group NWA, Dre helped create gangsta rap and watched its impact spread across the globe. And, as a consequence of that breakthrough, he became lauded as the finest producer in rap. Newsweek called him "the Phil Spector of hip-hop", and he won a Grammy award after his first solo album, The Chronic.</p>
      <p>But the timbre of our conversation has changed. Dre is progressively less relaxed the more we talk about those years of high acclaim. His broad 6ft 2in frame folds into itself, his knee bobs up and down nervily. Finally, it occurs to me that what he's uncomfortable about has nothing to do with music. Rather, he's edgy about where his success led. And how money and fame threatened to consume him as thoroughly, and fatally, as it did to so many of those around him.</p>
      <p>In the 60s, before it became famous through an NWA record, Compton was regarded as a neighbourhood of hope. With the phasing out of the city's racist housing policies, black families fled the ghettos of Watts and headed en masse for Compton's palm-tree-lined streets. Today, it has become a battleground in the vicious feud between LA's two main black street gangs, the Bloods and the Crips. It was Andre Young's love of music that kept him out of trouble in the neighbourhood. The last of his divorced mother's three children, he was playing records from her extensive collection from as early as three years old. "I'd put on a record at my mother's card parties, and people would scream out or get up and dance. I just loved stirring people up."</p>
      <p>During high school, he deejayed at parties and clubs, and won a college scholarship to study mechanical drawing. Instead, though, he left school at 16 to join one of LA's earliest rap groups, the World Class Wreckin' Kru. It was an inauspicious start to his career. Inspired by the extravagant stage-gear of acts such as Parliament and Earth Wind &amp; Fire, the group wore flamboyant costumes that brought together the previously unconnected fields of hip-hop and high camp. Spandex jumpsuits, lace ruffs, off-the-shoulder capes and mascara featured heavily. Dre skulked at the back wearing eyeliner and, in a weak pun on his name, a surgeon's gown and mask. He was determined that his next group would use rap as a vehicle for reality, not fantasy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, at the height of their notoriety, when the FBI was calling for their heads and police forces went on alert in advance of the group's arrival in their town, NWA had a simple response to criticism: they were just reporters, telling the facts as they saw them. It was a seductive argument. But reportage follows principles of objectivity. And Niggaz With Attitude, the five-piece Dre founded with Eric "Eazy-E" Wright and O'Shea "Ice Cube" Jackson in 1986 were anything but dispassionate in their work.</p>
      <p>In the mid-80s, hip-hop was dominated by sober New York-based rap groups such as Public Enemy, the standard bearers for a black nationalist agenda subscribed to, at least in name, by most acts on the East Coast. Over on the West Coast, NWA had other ideas. Instead of Malcolm X or the Nation Of Islam, they turned for inspiration to the ghetto fiction of pimp-turned-novelist Iceberg Slim and the bawdy humour of Richard Pryor, Dolemite and Red Foxx. Like them, the group spun tales from the less salubrious aspects of black life. They rapped about drug deals gone wrong and drive-by shootings, gang warfare and police confrontations, grasping, materialist women (ho's) and unfaithful lovers (bitches), all of which was set to an exhilarating, cinematic soundtrack produced by Dre. And they were delighted when the moral panic stirred by their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, released on Eazy -E's Ruthless records in 1988, turned them into the most famous, and infamous, rappers in America.</p>
      <p>Outraged by songs such as Fuck Tha Police, politicians, civic leaders and, most spectacularly, the FBI accused the group of glorifying violence to sell records. Ultimately, however, NWA's success was based on their shrewd understanding of modern media. Courting notoriety meant that they could bypass both radio and MTV, which anyway refused to play them. Instead, newspaper headlines, debates on CNN and Home Office raids on their record company's UK HQ brought them worldwide attention.</p>
      <p>"After we started getting flak from FBI agents and people of that nature, we said, 'Okay, we're going to really fuck with you now,'" says Dre gleefully. "So we started making the music even heavier." The strategy worked. Straight Outta Compton went gold in six weeks (600,000 record sales) then platinum (one million record sales), and after that double platinum. Niggaz 4 Life, the follow-up, went straight to number one in the US charts. Barely out of his teens, Dre was rich and famous. It was the start of his troubles.</p>
      <p>Estranged from Eazy-E's Ruthless label following a dispute over management and finances, Dre began work on The Chronic, the solo album that would come to consolidate his reputation at the forefront of hip-hop. As in-house producer at Ruthless, he had already been responsible for a string of million-selling albums. In return, he rewarded himself with a lavish lifestyle that included an enormous French colonial-style house, numerous high-grade sports cars and a ceaseless round of parties. "My house was full of people all the time. You could come over on Sunday morning and there's just people laying out on the floor asleep. Girls all over the place. I was spending money on a lot of cars, jewellery, apartments all over town. I probably bought somewhere between eight to 10 cars. Ferraris, I don't know how many Mercedes, Corvettes . . . it was just dumb shit. I blew a lot of money. I was letting people in my life that were straight up there totally to see what they can get out of my pocket, and I wasn't seeing this. It was just about the party to me, and you gotta have people around to have a party."</p>
      <p>Insulated from criticism by his retinue of hangers-on, and with a reputation as a hardcore rapper to maintain, Dre began reacting to criticism with sudden, petulant rage. At a music-industry party in 1991, he attacked TV show host Dee Barnes after an uncomplimentary report about NWA had aired on her programme. "Dre picks me up by my hair and my ear," Barnes told the writer Ronin Ro, in his gangsta rap expose, Have Gun Will Travel. In terror, she dashed into the ladies' washroom. Dre pursued her. "He grabs my hair again, throws me to the front of the bathroom. I just duck down and just . . . take my ass-whipping, you know what I mean? There's nobody helping me and there's no way in hell I could throw a punch at him." In response to the attack, Barnes filed a $ 20 -million lawsuit, although the case was eventually settled out of court. Dre muttered to Rolling Stone, "I was in the wrong, but it's not like I broke the bitch's arm."</p>
      <p>The Dee Barnes affair was only the prelude to a catalogue of misdemeanours during 1992. In June that year, Dre was fined $ 10,000 and placed under electronic house arrest for 90 days with a tagging device around his ankle. He had been found guilty of breaking the jaw of an aspirant rap producer, Damon Thomas. In October, he served another 30 days after pleading guilty to the battery of a police officer during a large brawl that took place in the lobby of a New Orleans hotel. Some events were beyond his control, though. He was shot in the legs after gunfire broke out at a party he was attending. And, following a raucous party of his own, the producer was forced to stand by and watch his grand house go up in flames. "We'd had a party at my house the night before. We had a barbecue, and the next day the coals from the barbecue were dumped in a trash can which was pushed up against the house," says Dre. "They set the house on fire. And boom, there you have it. House going up in smoke!"</p>
      <p>Post-NWA, Dre was now living the life he'd once only rapped about. And it was proving too much. "I was out of control," he admits. "I was wildin' out, partying, women . . . I think the business, and all the fame and fortune, just sucked me in and I had to step back and see that I was ruining everything that I had worked so hard at building."</p>
      <p>Frustrated by continued wrangling with Eazy-E, Dre co-founded a new label in 1992, Death Row. Within four years, it would be worth an estimated $ 200 million, becoming one of the most successful black-owned labels of all time. But before then, it became clear that the company had a major liability: Death Row's other owner. Marion "Suge" Knight was a 300lb, 6ft 3in former professional footballer-turned-businessman. He was also a convicted felon with gangster connections, whom ABC television described in 1996 as "the most dangerous man in music". While Dre was the production brains of Death Row, Knight was its public face. At its inception, he talked of creating a label as successful and culturally important as Motown. In its early days, this didn't seem like an idle boast.</p>
      <p>Death Row's first release was The Chronic. Hailed as a masterpiece by critics, it marked Dre's maturing as a producer and performer. Acutely well-crafted, the album updated the sensual, oleaginous funk of George Clinton for the hip -hop era. Like Straight Outta Compton, it was also a guide to the street life of LA. Instead of NWA's menacing imagery, however, The Chronic imagined an urban Elysium of low-rider cars, poolside parties, bikini-clad girls and high -quality marijuana. True, there were an obligatory number of weapons brandished and insults hurled (although most of the latter were issued at Eazy -E), but there was also love. The album introduced the Death Row "family" of new artists who shared a spirit of friendly collaboration on many of its tracks. They were to be the stars of the new Motown. Chief among them was Dre's protege, a tall, fine-featured rapper, whose laidback manner and hangdog expression had earned him the childhood nickname Snoopy. As Snoop Doggy Dogg, he became the label's first home-grown star, with a debut album, Doggystyle, that outsold Dre's. By 1996, The Chronic and Doggystyle had earned an estimated $ 50 million and $ 63 million in retail sales, respectively.</p>
      <p>None of this was enough for Suge Knight, though. As Death Row grew in strength, so too did his greed. Knight took to holding unconventional business meetings with rivals. To resolve Dre's long-running feud with Eazy-E, he allegedly threatened the latter at gunpoint, forcing him to relinquish Ruthless's rights to Dre's work. Other record company executives shared similar tales of intimidation, and even outright assault. In 1992, Knight faced assault charges after the pistol-whipping of two brothers, George and Lynwood Stanley, in the offices of Death Row. Catching them using the office payphone, Knight beat them, ordered them to strip naked and then robbed them. They deserved their punishment, insisted the Death Row boss. He was waiting for a phone call.</p>
      <p>A climate of terror settled over the label's Wilshire Boulevard offices. Members of the Piru Blood gang, an arm of the feared Bloods street gang that was friendly with Knight, took to hanging out there, swapping prison stories and shaking down staff for cash. They were also there to mete out summary justice on behalf of Knight. Subtitled The Spectacular Rise And Violent Fall Of Death Row Records, Ronin Ro's Have Gun Will Travel describes, in gory detail, the disorder that reigned there: "If Suge felt someone was trying to cheat him, the offender would be dragged into a storeroom by his goons and pounded to a bloody pulp. Death Row employees went about their filing and faxing as blood-curdling shrieks filled the office. They saw the doorknob jerking, knowing that people were desperately trying to escape a beating, thinking, I'm trying to get out this motherfucking room that they done locked this door on!"</p>
      <p>The chaos within Death Row seemed indicative of deeper stresses in the hardcore hip-hop world. Gangsta rap was reaching critical mass. The once close -knit Death Row family fell into rivalrous camps. "It became, 'What kinda car does this person have. I gotta get a better car than that'; 'My house has to look better than this person's house'," says Dre. "When the money started coming into play from Death Row, that's when the problems just went haywire."</p>
      <p>Worse followed. In 1995, the notoriously promiscuous Eazy-E died after contracting Aids. In 1996, Snoop Doggy Dogg stood trial for murder. He was acquitted. But that same year, Tupac Shakur, a recent signing to Death Row and one of rap's brightest stars, was killed in a drive-by shooting. Sitting beside him in the same car, Suge Knight escaped largely unhurt. There was speculation that the shots were never intended for Shakur, but rather Knight. Two weeks later, the Death Row boss was behind bars after being caught on security camera taking part in the group beating of a member of the Crips street gang, sworn enemies of Knight's associates, the Bloods. A serial offender with eight previous convictions, he had violated the terms of his probation received for assaulting the Stanley brothers. Knight was sentenced to nine years in jail. The FBI, IRS, DEA and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms immediately began joint investigations into Death Row on possible racketeering charges related to Knight's alleged business links with the drug -dealing Piru Blood gang. Death Row's grand dreams had melted into air.</p>
      <p>"In the beginning, it was all about Niggers coming up," commented Dre in the hip-hop magazine Blaze. "Then it turned into a fucking Don Corleone thing. It was like a movie. You come into his (Knight's) office and can't step on the carpet's Death Row emblem and all that crazy shit. It didn't need to escalate like that . . . I got tired of seeing engineers get they ass beat for rewinding a tape too far."</p>
      <p>Dre says he decided to leave Death Row after going to jail. Arrested on a drunk-driving charge, he was found guilty of violating the parole he received for breaking Damon Thomas's jaw. "To be honest, prison was probably the best thing that could have happened to me in my life," he says earnestly. "Everything was happening so fast, the success I was having, all the money coming in, all the girls, all the partying. I never had a chance to say, 'Yo, what do I want my life to hold?' I had to find myself. And it was crazy. I saw a confused individual. A guy that wasn't sure what he really wanted out of life. It made me say, 'Yo, man, fuck those streets, fuck everything that's going on out there on those streets. Is this the life I wanna lead, or do I wanna be a businessman, be able to take care of my family, chill out, have fun and make money while I'm sleeping?'"</p>
      <p>Dre now lives with his wife, Nicole, and their two young sons on a $ 4.9 -million estate in a gated community in the San Fernando Valley. He abandoned his stake in Death Row while it was still a force in the music industry, trading income for "peace of mind". Ultimately, he believes his "real talent" lies in producing, directing and scoring films. He has already written a screenplay based on his own life, called Please Listen To My Demo. Yet although he's now a 20-year veteran of the music business, his career is far from over. In fact, it's just enjoying its third swell.</p>
      <p>In 1996, Dre started his own label, Aftermath, backed by Interscope records, part of the entertainment conglomerate, Universal. Aftermath's contract is due for renogotiation, and industry observers predict that it will net Dre a nine -figure sum. Following the disappointment of its first release, Dr Dre Presents . . . The Aftermath, the label is now thriving. Dr Dre 2001 has sold five million copies since November 1999 and, in 26-year-old white rapper Eminem, it also has a major new star. A skilled, darkly-comic performer from Detroit (born Marshall Mathers), Eminem's records have sparked controversy for their warped reflections on sex, drugs and teen life. The response is an echo of the furore that surrounded NWA more than a decade earlier. Dre, who produced the rapper's debut album, The Slim Shady LP, is amused. It's easy to see why.</p>
      <p>In the years since Straight Outta Compton, real life, with its celebrity scandals and high-school shoot-outs, has worked hard to outgun even the most lurid fantasies of hardcore rap. Entertainment culture has responded by becoming more provocative and more sexualised, from Reservoir Dogs and Boogie Nights in the US to Gail Porter's bare bottom projected on to the House of Commons in Britain. Under the circumstances, it's difficult to argue that hardcore hip-hop, in particular, deserves to be excoriated. But it does raise a question. NWA are currently in the studio, recording a comeback album called Not These Niggaz Again, with Snoop Dogg replacing the late Eazy-E. But just what is there left for them to rebel against? "I know people are gonna be, like, 'NWA started this whole genre of hardcore hip-hop or gangsta rap music - what else are they gonna talk about?' " nods Dre. "But once we deliver the record and it's hot, and it's a record that you can buy and bump and just roll out and wild out to, what the album is about won't matter." Besides, he counters, "I don't think it's easy to sell records when you're just trying to shock and inflame. It's been done a thousand times after NWA came, and nobody's reached the success that we had."</p>
      <p>Perhaps Dre's real art is not in shock, then, but seduction. Like his heroes, Pryor, Iceberg Slim, Tarantino and Scorsese, he has remade the brute antagonisms of street life as beautiful, dissonant poetry. While critics of hardcore rap have concentrated on its lyrics, Dre has been more concerned with what it should feel like; with how it bumps and rolls. Knowing all the while that art shouldn't aim simply to imitate life. But to outdo it</p>
      <p>Forgot About Dre, by Dr Dre featuring Emimem, is released on Interscope on May 27.</p>

      <title>Women: The wind in your sales: What is it about the January sales that sends women into a frenzy? Jess Cartner-Morley on the sociology of shopping</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It's the January sales. This is the time when the doolally female love affair with shopping is shown in starkest relief. All over the country, women are choosing to brave crowds and freezing temperatures in the pursuit of items they probably don't need and very likely can't afford - and not out of necessity, but for fun. Recent research by Elle magazine found that 55% of women in Asian countries preferred shopping to relaxation or spending time with their partner. For many women, retail therapy, pure and simple, is how they get their kicks.</p>
      <p>But why do women love shopping so much? And perhaps more importantly, why do men apparently not? When it comes to shopping, the sexes are worlds apart. Men tend to view shopping as a chore, a necessary way of obtaining things they need; for women, it is a leisure activity and a reward.</p>
      <p>Certainly, it is clear that in a consumer society, shopping has come to stand for much more than just buying things. It is your ticket to an idealised self. Charles Revson, who founded Revlon in 1932, figured this out long ago, saying, "In the factory we make cosmetics; in the store we sell hope." But it is in recent years that the culture of shopping has become increasingly about image rather than substance.</p>
      <p>Dr Helga Dittmar, social psychologist at Sussex University, points out how dramatically advertising has changed in the past few decades. "If you look at advertising in the 1950s, it's much more about the product and what it does: a soap that cleans well, for example. Now advertising is all about young attractive people doing something aspirational. Shopping has moved far away from the traditional rational consumer model. It's not about obtaining goods for our needs, but about buying identities."</p>
      <p>If it is women who have been most seduced by this, it may be because shopping is associated with an evolutionary instinct to nurture and provide for the family that has traditionally been a female role. The emotional and psychological benefits that the shopping experience promises centre around improving one's personal appearance, and a gossipy bonding experience for friends - notions which, all the evidence would suggest, are more important to women than they are to men.</p>
      <p>The realm of feelgood shopping is now spreading even to domestic spheres. The rise of the domestic goddesses, from Nigella Lawson to the more recent emergence of housework gurus (from How Clean Is Your House to Vogue's Rita Konig), has elevated previously mundane consumer items to must-have status. Quirky cookie-cutters and pretty ironing board covers are becoming as much a lifestyle statement as Gucci handbags. They are accessories for the life we want to lead, not the life we really lead.</p>
      <p>Shopping, bluntly, combines female comradeship with the opportunity to make oneself more attractive to men. It is the sweet, acceptable, feminine face of a materialistic world. It allows us escapism - the kid-in-a-sweet-shop elation of a blow-out spree - and a nibble of an aspirational lifestyle. The lifestyle of the female urban sophisticate, as idealised in Sex and the City, revolves around a fetishistic obsession with Jimmy Choos and being on first-name terms with the manager of Prada. This lifestyle has become common currency amongst advertisers: even the latest adverts for store-next-door Marks &amp; Spencer feature expensively clad women sipping expensive coffees, surrounded by shopping bags.</p>
      <p>It's not just about what we buy, but they way that we buy it. Aside from the moment when you hand over your card and sign, the experience of sales shopping in a boutique or department store could scarcely be more different from that of the weekly supermarket shop. In a supermarket, racing-track straight lines and bright lighting encourage a brisk, no-loitering attitude; in a boutique, layout is designed to encourage meandering, and to accommodate groups of two or three browsing together.</p>
      <p>The importance, for the retailer, of creating the right shopping "experience" is reflected in the success of the Net-a-Porter online fashion boutique. Net-a-Porter has succeeded where many other shopping websites have failed, because it goes to great lengths to recreate the shopping "rush". The site is designed to echo a glossy magazine, and purchases arrive the same day, beautifully wrapped in tissue paper inside a stiff, ribbon-tied bag. "Our philosophy is to exceed expectations," says owner and founder Natalie Massanet. "Because women love shopping, we had to make it better. It's a VIP service that is offered to everyone who loves fashion."</p>
      <p>In part, the rise of shopping is simple economics. Disposable income has risen in recent decades. "What's more, with credit cards and store cards now widely available, you can spend money you don't have, which you couldn't do 20 years ago," says Dittmar. But clearly many women enjoy the shopping experience without getting into debt. Among teenage girls, going shopping is a favourite Saturday activity, often involving a meagre haul of a sparkly hairclip or new nail polish. The hours devoted to shopping can be vastly out of proportion to the amount of cash actually spent. "The social element of shopping, and the part that involves having fantasies - how would I look in this dress, what would happen if I wore it - is still there, for women, even if you don't buy anything," says Dittmar.</p>
      <p>In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir called shopping "a profound pleasure, a discovery, almost an invention". Shopping enables women to enjoy the position of strength won by economic independence: as potential consumers, they have the power to give or withhold their money, to be flattered and courted by simpering shop assistants. But there is also truth in the view of Germaine Greer, who famously called shopping "a festival of the female oppressed". The L'Oreal strapline "Because You're Worth It" encapsulates a vacuous culture in which money and beauty are somehow equated with self-worth. The consumer is encouraged to declare her worth by spending money on a lipstick which will help her to look like the model in the ad - who is, presumably, "worth it" because she is beautiful.</p>
      <p>"Greer's point is similar to what Susie Orbach and others have written about the thinness fetish, about how a culture that seems to give women what they want in fact disempowers them," says Dittmar. It is difficult to argue with the suggestion that women could probably be doing something more empowering than fighting their way to the rail to bag the last size 14.</p>
      <p>Dittmar's research suggests that the cult of shopping is still growing. She is convinced that today's adolescents are more materialistic than those in the past. What's more, "the gender difference in attitudes to shopping is much narrower in the younger generation". Tomorrow's men, it seems, will be joining us on the shop floor. Is this a good thing? Does retail therapy work? "If you buy clothes and they make you look better, that can make you feel better - so to that extent, shopping can work. I wouldn't say it was just an illusion. But it has a real potential for going wrong, because people are hunting after fantasies that can't possibly be fulfilled. If you're looking for happiness, if you're trying to plug gaps in your life, solve problems with your job, or with your relationship, then I don't think trying to buy happiness is going to work."</p>

      <title>G2: Arts: Charm offensive: Taboo-busting musical The Book of Mormon has been a US smash. As the show lands in London, Mark Lawson talks to its stars about charges of racism, hype - and why they're shocked by Alan Carr</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Two years ago, the cast of a new Broadway musical was given the sort of security briefing more common for politicians during a terrorist red alert. "We were prepped for intensity," remembers Jared Gertner, who was an understudy in the company at the time. "We were told there was going to be a whole format for how we received mail. You had to pre-register packages at the theatre, always sign in your guests and never open suspicious mail. All sorts of precautions. We were worried that people were going to revolt."</p>
      <p>As it turned out, the only violent protests against The Book of Mormon, when it opened in spring 2011, were from customers who couldn't get in. At the Eugene O'Neill theatre in New York the house has been full, and with hopeful queues outside, for two years; the introduction of a sliding scale based on demand (a model borrowed from the aviation industry) means that some tickets are selling for almost $500. All six weeks of a recently announced Toronto run sold out within 30 minutes. Such is the demand in London, that some resale sites are offering tickets for up to £350.</p>
      <p>After graduating from understudy to co-star on Broadway, Gertner now stars in the British premiere with Gavin Creel; the two play Elder Price and Elder Cunningham, two young missionaries sent to evangelise Uganda. Gertner plays the stocky, sweaty, nerdy one and Creel the tall, smooth, cool one - a double-act of classical physical contrast. "Yes," agrees Gertner. "They had to hire a mess like Gavin to counteract my beauty."</p>
      <p>The reason for those Secret Service-like briefings was the fear of angry reaction from Mormons. In fact, as Gertner says, the faith, founded in Utah in the early 19th century, was "really cool about it" and has placed ads aimed at potential converts in both the American and British theatre programmes. Perhaps Mormons have been relaxed because the musical, written by Robert Lopez with Trey Parker and Matt Stone (makers of the spectacularly transgressive South Park), is pan-offensive: there are jokes about Christians, Jews, homosexuals, Starbucks and, frequently, Africans, including references to the prevalence of Aids and of female genital mutilation on the continent.</p>
      <p>At the London preview I saw, this latter aspect led to a leading media liberal asking loudly in the foyer afterwards: "Why has nobody said that this is racist?" Talking to the two leads in Gertner's dressing room, I suggested that such reactions might be a problem in London because Britain is less racially evolved than America.</p>
      <p>"Less racially evolved?" gasps Gertner.</p>
      <p>"Well, you have a black president. We're a long way off a black prime minister."</p>
      <p>"Oh, sure," says Creel. "But look at how half the country treats that president."</p>
      <p>Have Americans shared that London liberal's worry about the show? "I've heard people say it is racist," acknowledges Gertner. "But if you take any bit out of context, you might find racism, you might find blasphemy, you might find shock. But please watch the whole show until the end, when it is all tied together. The African community actually end up being the wisest and smartest people. I think the show is partly a comment on American blindness about what Africa is actually like. They think it's like The Lion King."</p>
      <p>Creel agrees. "I don't think the overall message is offensive. And I think that reaction is partly because it's a musical. If we were doing an entire play about race - even if it contained terrible, offensive words - you would accept that. But because it's a musical, people aren't always ready for it."</p>
      <p>The actors admit that even they were startled by some of the material. Before auditioning, Gertner read the script in a production office, because no scripts were allowed out. "And I just thought, 'They can't do this, they can't say this, it can't happen!' My chin was on the floor."</p>
      <p>Creel, in a preview audience for that show, was astonished to find a Broadway chorus singing the words "Fuck you, God!" to the sky, and to see an African character who insists he can be cured of Aids by raping a baby. "And I was, like, 'Woah! That's too much!' But it's like the South Park movie (Longer, Bigger and Uncut), where they set out to offend everyone - nobody was safe. And it is like they are saying: let's have an end to all these taboos. Ask yourself why you're offended. If you just say 'I'm offended!', you are not engaging with the material. Ask yourself what it is about the material that gets you."</p>
      <p>Despite these risks, The Book of Mormon has attracted warm reviews (one American critic called it the "greatest musical of the century"), largely because of its improbable combination of the savage and the sweet. In the US, politicians and celebrities have been happy to be seen in the theatre. "There was a list where you could find out who was coming," Gertner recalls. "And we generally preferred not to know. But there were some we had to be told - like Hillary Clinton or Oprah Winfrey, the most powerful woman in the world - because the building had to be readied. Hillary left during the curtain calls, for security reasons, but Oprah came and was photographed with the cast."</p>
      <p>All understudies dream of the knock on the dressing-room door shortly before the performance; very few manage the transition from stand-in to star. Unusually, Gertner performed 70 times on Broadway as a replacement, initally because a cast member had fallen ill. "The first time I went on was earlier than expected, with Tony award voters in the audience and so on," he says. "I was under-rehearsed but not underprepared, because I'd been doing the show in my living room every night."</p>
      <p>Is the understudy's dilemma that you want to get on, but you don't want it to depend on someone getting ill? "Yeah. It's a really tricky thing, karmically. I'd have friends going, 'I'm coming to the show next week - should I push him down the stairs so we see you?' And I'd say, 'No!' You want the other guy to be off because he's booked a vacation or he's shooting a movie."</p>
      <p>The expectation of success can be as great a psychological pressure as the fear of failure. Does the cast of a smash hit suffer a special kind of nerves, an anxiety about justifying the hype? Creel nods. "You just have to forgive yourself that it isn't going to live up to everyone's expectations. There's no way you can deliver 'the greatest musical of the century'. Some people are going to hate it just because they came in wanting to prove the reviews wrong. But it's harder to be in a commercial hit that's no good, where you're saying to your friends, 'I know it's a piece of crap but it makes money.' I was in Hair, which didn't work in London, but it was a show we all believed in."</p>
      <p>Gertner adds that he once worked with the writer-director James Lapine, a frequent collaborator with Stephen Sondheim. "He gave us a piece of advice: if you base your success on the reactions of audiences, you are fucked as actors for the rest of your career. That has always stuck with me. My only barometer for the show can be what happens on stage."</p>
      <p>Between rehearsals and previews, the actors have been adjusting to London living. (They are so enthusiastic about Marks &amp; Spencer food that the company should perhaps consider taking out ads alongside the Mormons.) Gertner has also warmed to British TV: "I was watching Alan Carr the other night, and there was an athlete talking about ejaculation for 10 minutes! And I thought: in America, that show would have been taken off air."</p>
      <p>They have also been seeing London theatre, including the revival of A Chorus Line. Set at a Broadway audition, that musical has a moment in which the wannabes are divided into two groups, but cruelly tricked about which are the stayers and which the leavers. Is that stunt, I wondered, ever pulled in New York auditions?</p>
      <p>"No!" says Gertner. "Only in reality TV shows. Isn't it funny? People like Simon Cowell say horrible things to contestants and add, 'You'd better get used to this because that is what it's like out there!' It's not what it's like out there. No one ever, when you finish singing, says, 'You're terrible. That stinks.' They say, 'Thank you!' and send you home."</p>
      <p>Unless there is a mass outbreak of puritanism in the West End, or a desire to prove America wrong, Creel and Gertner seem unlikely to be sent home for many months.</p>

      <title>You've got to have faith</title>
      <subtitle>Quarantine, Jim Crace's novel about Jesus in the desert, won the Whitbread Prize. Ben Payne thinks he can turn it into a good play. Chris Arnot talks to both of them</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The author Jim Crace is sitting with rock-like stillness on the edge of a grubby yellow sofa in the far corner of the rehearsal room. Perched on an adjacent chair, the literary manager of Birmingham Rep, Ben Payne, is almost motionless too. But the way he fiddles with his earring every now and then suggests he might not be quite as calm as he appears.</p>
      <p>A little apprehension would be understandable. It was Payne's idea to adapt for the stage Crace's novel Quarantine, about Jesus's 40 days in the Judean wilderness. What's more, he volunteered to take on the task himself a heavy responsibility considering the critical praise heaped on the book, winner of the 1997 Whitbread Prize.</p>
      <p>Any worries that the novelist would heap criticism on his adaptation evaporate as Crace's face breaks into a grin. 'He's a great choice,' he whispers to Payne, gesturing towards Terence Corrigan, the youthful actor who plays Christ. Corrigan is standing on a table talking to God with a discernible Northern Ireland accent. Crace likes the way he speaks and the way he looks: dark rather than blond.</p>
      <p>'The western view of Christ is usually of a stainless being with fair hair who appears to have come from Oslo,' he says after we have left the rehearsal room and settled in the cafe downstairs. 'This bloke looks and sounds like an over -zealous 19-year-old you might find in a church group or wandering down my street in Moseley.'</p>
      <p>Crace has lived in the cosmopolitan Birmingham suburb for over 20 years. Like Payne, he moved to the Midlands from London. The two met when Payne rang Crace and suggested his widely acclaimed novel would make a great play.</p>
      <p>'I hope I didn't sound churlish when I said I didn't want anything to do with it,' Crace recalls. 'My craft is writing novels. I've done the odd play for Radio 4, but this is theatre. Writers who want to interfere with adaptations of their work are basically undemocratic. The book still stands as an entity on its own. And if the play's a total failure, then I want everyone to know that it's Ben's fault,' he adds with another characteristic grin.</p>
      <p>Crace's mischievous sense of humour is never far from the surface, tempering the earnestness of his staunch socialist convictions. All the same, he gives the impression of being more serious about politics than about literature. 'There has been a film script of Quarantine,' he reveals. 'It was reasonably well received, but the bottom line was that it would only be bankrolled if the story was relocated to a survivalists' camp in modern America. I was rather keen on the idea, but the bloody scriptwriters wouldn't go ahead with it. They were too respectful to me. A writer can't expect to keep control.'</p>
      <p>Payne acknowledges Crace's generosity. 'If I'd had the sense of needing to have my homework marked all the time, I could never have got on with the script. But it was important to me for Jim to see what I'd done.'</p>
      <p>Like the film scriptwriters, he had too much respect to take liberties with the novelist's work. His aim, he says, has not been to improve on the novel but to give live audiences a different yet equally rewarding experience of the story.</p>
      <p>Easier said than done. 'There is a clear dramatic shape to the book but not much dialogue,' he says. 'And a lot of the action is internalised. In fiction, you can hide behind the narrative voice. I feared that wouldn't work for the stage. The challenge was to translate the language of the book into dialogue.'</p>
      <p>Most stage and screen adaptations are of classics, which become costume dramas, he says. Quarantine 'offers the chance to create a very different and remote world on stage while bringing it into close proximity with contemporary audiences.'</p>
      <p>As Crace points out, theatrical representations of biblical stories are hardly unfamiliar to us. 'This is the costume drama we've all been in,' he says. 'Almost everyone who's been to primary school in Britain has had towels put on their heads to play the shepherds in the nativity play.'</p>
      <p>He is pleased with the way Payne has approached the dialogue. 'When I listened to the read-through, I thought I could have written every word,' he says. 'Ben has even taken a phrase from elsewhere in the book and put it at the end in a way that is packed with meaning and irony. A cold lizard ran up my spine when I heard that.'</p>
      <p>Both author and adapter have come at the story from a similar standpoint on religion. They are both atheists. But 'that doesn't mean I set out to write a Salman Rushdie annihilation of Christianity,' Crace insists. 'It's a work of fiction, not a didactic pamphlet. In fact, I've had a lot of letters from Christians who've told me that the book has underscored their faith.'</p>
      <p>Payne can foresee church groups coming to see the play and finding it uplifting particularly now that the decision has been taken not to have Jesus on stage stark naked, as he is for most of the novel. 'Although there's irony in the book, it isn't cynical about religion,' he says. 'All the characters have belief, yet it's not being mocked. And it's important for a modern audience to understand their motivation.'</p>
      <p>Surely, though, there will be aspects that are lost in translation from page to stage? 'The main loss will be the landscape as a character in itself,' Crace concedes. 'But there will be gains as well when the intervening narrative is stripped away, allowing an extra layer of more direct humour.'</p>
      <p>He is particularly pleased by what he foresees will be a witty portrayal of Musa, the vast and venal merchant who promotes Christ as a miracle-worker capable of healing the sick and rising from the dead. Crace's ultimate ironic twist was to have news of these talents, highly ambiguous in the context of the novel, carried to a wider world by a devilish figure.</p>
      <p>'I always meant Musa to be monstrously witty,' he says. 'When he claims, 'These are my caves, this is my water' in the novel, there's nobody to say: 'Ooh, you fibber!' But in the stage version, there will be.' He hopes there will be some audience reaction as well. 'If they don't make noises in the right places, then I will.'</p>
      <p>Crace may have given away control of Quarantine the play, but his enthusiasm suggests he's not quite as detached from the end product as he likes to appear. Quarantine is at Birmingham Rep (0121-236 4455) from April 27May 20.</p>

      <title>G2: Cover story: Abis road: Take one demure, publicity shy nurse, a minor TV presenter and a scandalous court case. Add the tabloid press, a porn channel and a liberal sprinkling of ambition. Stir in a new TV cookery show, and leave to rise. Laura Barton on the making of Abi Titmuss - the ultimate C-list celeb</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The pivotal moment in the life of Abi Titmuss came on July 31, 2003. Titmuss, then a 25-year-old nurse, was known only, if she was known at all, for being the girlfriend of the scandal-licked presenter of ITV's This Morning, John Leslie. The naming of Leslie on live TV as the anonymous celebrity whom Ulrika Jonsson, another presenter, had allegedly accused of rape (Jonsson herself never named the man), had unleashed a media frenzy, and several women had emerged to accuse him of sexual assault, leading to a very public trial. His everpresent girlfriend, loyal and apparently discreet, had been largely applauded by the press throughout the trial for her devotion. Then, on the day Leslie was cleared of the charges, Titmuss emerged from court in a figure-hugging, low-cut black dress, a crucifix poised just above her cleavage. "She's started to look," observed Daily Mirror columnist Carole Malone, "like one of those girls who hang around TV stars desperate to get noticed, desperate to grab their 15 minutes of fame."</p>
      <p>Titmuss's 15 minutes of fame is undoubtedly now. She is regular fodder for the tabloids - last month even warranting a front-page story in the Sun when it was revealed that she was still living in her nurse's accommodation. She has presented on Virgin radio, appears stark naked on the cover of this month's FHM, and, the ultimate sign of arrival on the C-list, will this Sunday evening appear with Gordon Ramsay in the celebrity reality show Hell's Kitchen.</p>
      <p>Titmuss's transformation could be seen as the ultimate celebrity trajectory - from absolute nobody to red-top darling, becoming an eager, teeth-bared, envelope-opening ubiquity along the way. Her appearances in the newspapers have swollen spectacularly since the period when she was merely the girlfriend of another minor celeb (her name was mentioned 87 times in the mainstream press in the first half of 2003; in the first five months of this year there have been 295), and her image has altered drastically in the same period, acquiring an apparently unshakeable tarnish of trashiness. If the demands we make of those seeking fame continue to sink lower, Titmuss might be said to represent quite how far we have come, the ultimate scrapings from the very bottom of the wannabe barrel. So how, precisely, does one graduate from demure nursing girlfriend to tabloid sexpot? And what exactly is the allure of Abi Titmuss?</p>
      <p>In the beginning she was known as Abby, or Abigail, or Florence Nightingale. "Scots telly hunk John Leslie has found true love at last - with a young nurse," ran the Sun, breaking the story of their relationship on October 19 2000. By that stage Leslie had been dating Titmuss, a staff nurse at London's University College Hospital, for two years, having met in a nightclub in 1998. Leslie was already something of a TV name; Titmuss was entirely unaware who he was.</p>
      <p>But no one took too much notice until October 2002, when the rape allegations first surfaced. In the shots of the time she appears shadowed by Leslie - by then an on/off boyfriend - loyally clutching his hand and sporting her sensible nurse's uniform."She's a public-relations dream," wrote one columnist at the time, "with her sweet, pretty face, slight frame and nurse's uniform."</p>
      <p>It wasn't until the following March that Titmuss first emerged as a tabloid player in her own right, to "break her silence" in an interview with the News of the World. She spoke of the difficulty of handling the allegations against Leslie, and how her day job helped her to cope. "I don't think a model or soap actress would have known enough about real life or been emotionally strong enough to cope with what I've had to handle in six months," she observed. She talked of the tribulations of dating a celebrity: "John lived in this unreal showbiz bubble," she said. "They all do. He loved it - I hated it."</p>
      <p>But, during the trial, she seemed to find the attention increasingly bearable. "During the court case her clothes improved - she clearly wanted some of the limelight," recalls Joe Alvarez, a showbiz photographer. The gossip columnists were quick to seize on Titmuss's subtle transformation . "The pretty nurse . . . has gone from being a modern-day Florence Nightingale and mutated into a 'bazoomas out' Jordan-style clone," noted one columnist. Titmuss's publicist, Sam Mortner, sighs: " When the newspaper scandal broke it was midwinter; when the court case concluded it was mid-July, so it suited the press as an image for stories like Abi goes from Drab to Fab!"</p>
      <p>With Leslie's own career, despite his acquittal, effectively dead in the water, Titmuss's began to blossom. She quit nursing and was installed as a "roving reporter" on the Channel 4 Richard and Judy show. Then, in January, lurid tales of orgies, drug-taking and videotaped sex emerged. C4 distanced itself immediately; Titmuss then gave another exclusive interview to the News of the World, clad in angelic white. "I can't believe I was so stupid to go along with the drug deal." She was unrepentant, however, about the orgy claims: "You know what? I suppose I'm bloody well the perfect girlfriend. I stick up for John - I'm an angel in the courtroom and a whore in the bedroom."</p>
      <p>Titmuss faced a decision: should she quietly slink off back to nursing, or revel in her new-found notoriety? She chose the latter - and Leslie, it seemed, had now become surplus to requirements. "When a really salacious story comes out, normally the people involved try to distance themselves from it," says Polly Hudson, of the celebrity magazine Heat. "But Abi embraced it. She said, 'Y'know what? I'll do this and this and this, and look, here are my tits!' " And the tits are important. "Having boobs helps," says PR consultant Max Clifford. But the essence of her appeal is simple, he says: "She seemed like a shrinking violet, and she's anything but. And that's a nice concept, that's what would appeal - she's a girl-next-door turned sexy seductress." It certainly appealed to porn channel Television X, who swiftly signed Abi up as a presenter.</p>
      <p>It is Titmuss's overarching, persistent normality that has proved her most appealing quality, says Dominic Smith, managing editor of FHM, explaining why the magazine chose her for its startlingly saucy cover. "People have this idea that John Leslie corrupted this young nurse, but I think that was always her personality. The outfits got slightly sexier, but I think it's just that her true personality has come to the fore."</p>
      <p>Titmuss herself readily agreed to speak to the Guardian. "The first time you see a picture of yourself in the newspaper it's incredibly strange," she says. "You have to understand, I went through absolute hell. John and I had press outside the house for months and months. Every time I saw a patient reading a newspaper, I would be cringeing, my stomach would be turning. It was horrible." She is more philosophical now. "Even though I didn't invite the media into my house, I've got to have a positive relationship with them," she says. "And it's a symbiotic relationship, isn't it? Though sometimes there's a dichotomy - it might be a nice picture of me on the page, but next to that there might be an unpleasant story."</p>
      <p>In the last year she has learned the tricks of celebrity, says Hudson. "You can almost tick off the features as she's got more famous. If you look back to those early photographs of her in her uniform, she was the least sexy nurse ever, but since then the hair's got blonder and the outfits have got smaller." Titmuss is defensive. " I think anyone who's seen pictures of themselves looking ropey in the national press would be aware of their image," she argues. "I wasn't working so money was running out, and if you've the media camped outside your door you can't just go out to the hairdresser . . . And I'm feeling more myself now."</p>
      <p>But she still has some way to go, says Alvarez. "She's not really a celebrity. She's notorious. She's a C-list, C+ shall I say, along with Catalina and all the Big Brother lot and the Page Three girls. She will move up because of the Gordon Ramsey programme. She'll probably end up as a B, along with all the Brit actors, the big soap stars, and Liz Hurley." "For Heat readers she's very low down the celebrity scale," notes Hudson. "I'm not sure what it is that Titmuss does, except have big tits. She's above Richard Blackwood and Kym Marsh, and slightly below Rebecca Loos."</p>
      <p>Where she does score highly, however, is on the men's magazine scale. She appeared in FHM's Top 100 Sexiest Women poll, and the response to her naked cover shoot has been, according to Smith, "great". In the accompanying interview, Titmuss presses all the right lad mag buttons - her penchant for kissing girls, wearing her nurse's uniform in bed and her love of stockings. "What do I think of her?" wonders Alvarez. "There's two sides of me - I could say, 'Oh my God, what a disgusting woman!' But she could be the perfect girlfriend - fulfil your every fantasy then go out and get the drugs for you. You wouldn't marry her, though."</p>
      <p>She is, says her agent, inundated with work. There are radio and TV offers, a column for FHM and even the offer of a record deal. Paul Jackson, programme director at Virgin radio, even thinks she could stay the distance. "Back in 94, when Liz Hurley wore that dress, people said who is she?" he recalls. "But before you know it, it's as if she's always been there."</p>
      <p>"She's a new arrival in the premier league, and she could have a very good year," says Clifford. "If she's well looked after." Celebrity, he seems to say, is an art to perfect: " You turn down 20 invitations for every one you accept - that's TV appearances, newspaper interviews, everything, so people don't get tired. You spread it across so you're in the papers the chief executives would read, so you impress them, as well as the tabloids."</p>
      <p>" It's all about women," says Hudson. "Unless she can turn round women's perception of her, unless she can play a blinder in this Gordon Ramsay thing, then her 15 minutes are up. Abi has to convince us girls that she's one of us. Cos she hardly seems a girl's girl. She seems like the sort of girl who'd steal your boyfriend and ask you to watch."</p>
      <p>Titmuss herself is well aware that now is the make-or-break moment in her career. "I've been unlucky, and I've been silly, and I've been through dark times, but now I have to attempt to redress the balance," she says. "I have absolutely no idea why me. I have nothing that's different. Even I wonder sometimes what I might think of this Abi Titmuss character."</p>

      <title>Work: A break for the better: In the wake of BT and other high-profile firms offering employees time off in exchange for a wage cut, Lisa Bachelor looks at how to get the most out of an unexpected career hiatus</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>'Take this £10,000 and a year off work." For many people, this sort of statement from their employer remains the stuff of dreams. Yet, increasingly, employers are coming up with just this sort of ploy in order to retain valuable staff in the long term while cutting costs in an effort to survive the recession.</p>
      <p>BT is the latest high-profile employer to propose that staff take up to a year off, in this case in return for agreeing to a 75% pay cut.</p>
      <p>To encourage more workers to take up the offer, the company is paying the reduced salary as an upfront cash payment - so someone on a £30,000 salary would get a £7,500 lump sum.</p>
      <p>But BT is by no means alone. In less appealing moves, British Airways has asked staff to work for free during the summer and to switch to part-time hours - a move rejected this week by some 2,000 of its cabin crew - while City consultancy KPMG has proposed a move to a four-day week.</p>
      <p>"These redundancy avoidance strategies are quite uncharacteristic of anything that happened in the 1990s recession," says Mike Emmott, employee relations adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.</p>
      <p>"In the past, companies never thought about the negative effects of mass compulsory redundancies. Now they realise if you want a happy, engaged workforce you don't start by dismissing as many people as you can, as soon as you can."</p>
      <p>BA aside, such moves are proving perhaps surprisingly popular - 86% of KPMG staff signed up for the cut in hours and pay, while earlier this week BT employees, posting on internet talkboards, suggested their company's proposal is far from a bad idea.</p>
      <p>"I work for BT and I'm relieved to see efforts focus on voluntary measures to reduce costs, especially when I see the huge number of compulsory job losses elsewhere," said one.</p>
      <p>"Such a refreshing stance from BT," said another. "Much better than the 'axe now, worry later' method of other employers."</p>
      <p>Of course offers - or in some cases more coercive "encouragement" - to take cuts in hours and pay, are not ideal for many, particularly those with families and large mortgages to pay. But for other employees, who have no children or big financial commitments, the idea of a year off and getting some money to do it, has obvious appeal.</p>
      <p>Limit your beach time</p>
      <p>But how should employees who take up such offers, use their new-found free time?</p>
      <p>There is the obvious temptation to use the time to kick-back, lie on the beach and reread the Harry Potter series. But a year off work - paid - is an invaluable opportunity to boost future career prospects and many will be keen to explore this avenue.</p>
      <p>For those who have always wanted to work overseas, there are dozens of charities including VSO, Action for Children, Challenges Worldwide and Raleigh who will organise placements abroad. These cover just about every skill-set you could think of, from medicine to communications to teaching.</p>
      <p>Different charities have different approaches to their placements; some will ask you to fundraise as well as meet minimal living costs, while others will cover your costs, including your flights, and may offer you a small salary.</p>
      <p>Enquiries to VSO have more than doubled over the last six months, compared with the same period last year, with the largest increase in interest from the business and financial sector.</p>
      <p>One thing to bear in mind, however, is that voluntary placements can often take a long time to organise - expect to wait at least six months between applying and flying out with VSO, for example - and most will expect a commitment to the job of at least three to six months.</p>
      <p>"For volunteers that come through organisations that we have already partnered, the time to organise a placement is a lot shorter," says Catherine Raynor of VSO.</p>
      <p>The evidence suggests that those who have the patience to set up a placement are rewarded in the long-term. A study by the Chartered Management Institute and VSO found that 80% of volunteers believed they returned with expertise that they would not have gained in the UK.</p>
      <p>Almost all said they were now more capable of handling different cultures and three-quarters suggested they became better communicators. Around half also claimed that voluntary work had developed problem-solving abilities and influencing skills.</p>
      <p>The report also indicated broad support from employers for those who have undertaken overseas volunteer activity, with 94% agreeing or strongly agreeing that it increases skills, and 48% believing it increases employability.</p>
      <p>Lynette Savings, 56, was head of policy for a national UK charity until she was made redundant in December. She is now volunteering in Hanoi, Vietnam, through VSO with an NGO called Light, which provides reproductive health services and HIV testing and counselling. Her job there is to develop a long-term funding and organisational strategy for Light.</p>
      <p>"Rather than apply for other jobs in an increasingly difficult employment market, I decided to use it (redundancy) as an opportunity to do something challenging and completely different," she says.</p>
      <p>"I had been thinking about VSO for a couple of years but it took the prod of redundancy to make me do it."</p>
      <p>Take a look closer to home</p>
      <p>But while most people tend to think of volunteering as an overseas venture, there are plenty of opportunities close to home. These will typically be quicker to organise, can offer a lot of the same skills development without the culture shock, and can be of particular benefit to those who have had their working weeks cut, rather than been given a chunk of time off.</p>
      <p>WRVS is one of the UK's largest charities and voluntary organisations and offers practical services to older people. Typical volunteer activities range from helping with things like gardening and shopping to working in hospital coffee shops.</p>
      <p>But if this sort of "grass roots" volunteer work doesn't appeal, the charity is also able to offer office-based or home-based opportunities in roles such as HR, marketing, finance and communication.</p>
      <p>Chris Dobson, head of volunteering at WRVS, says one key thing that has changed about volunteering is the flexibility of companies to adapt to the new breed of volunteers.</p>
      <p>"Gone are the days when we had a vast army of housewives who would volunteer with us and stay for 50 years," she says. "As a sector we now have to be more flexible in our approach. If someone is only available for three months, for example, there might be a project or a piece of work we can arrange for them to do for us."</p>
      <p>She says that anyone who is inter ested in volunteering at a particular organisation, but wants to make use of existing qualifications, should approach that charity and ask if it can accommodate that skill set in some way.</p>
      <p>"You might not fancy working in a hospital tea bar but you might want to expand your marketing skills," she says.</p>
      <p>Websites like do-it.org.uk and volunteering.org.uk allow you to search volunteer opportunities by postcode. For those who have been told to take extra time off over the summer, theca reerbreaksite.com has a wealth of information on short-term overseas and UK volunteering opportunities.</p>
      <p>If you have recently had your hours cut or have been laid off from a job you loved, there may be hope on the horizon. Nissan, in Sunderland, for example, recently re-employed 250 of the 400 temporary workers it made redundant in January. "This is encouraging news and shows that current employment decisions are not necessarily a one-way street," says Emmott.</p>

      <title>G2: Culture: When the playboy met the liar: In The Deal, he made a gripping TV drama out of the Blair-Brown pact. Now, in his first play, Peter Morgan is taking on another clash of titans: Richard Nixon and David Frost. He talks to Gareth McLean - Correction Appended</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>When he researched Frost/Nixon, his play about the televised 1977 encounters between David the interviewer and Richard the disgraced former US president, Peter Morgan went the extra mile. He travelled from London to Washington DC to immerse himself in the culture of the city and observe the whirr of the American political class at close range. He met and interviewed most of those featured in the play - not Nixon, of course, but his former aides, and John Birt, who was then Frost's producer and would go on to become director general of the BBC. He employed an American politics tutor whom he would visit for two hours every Friday and quiz on the difference between a governor, a senator and a congressman, what primaries are, how the US government works.</p>
      <p>And, of course, he met with Frost, now an elderly knight of the realm but, in 1977, the international playboy interviewer and bon viveur who presented chat shows on three continents. A man, Morgan says, whose natural habitat would be a cocktail party, a man who likes opulence.</p>
      <p>"An anecdote I was told about Frost was that he'd never take a taxi if he could have a limo, never a limo if he could have a chopper, never a chopper if he could have a private plane. And that's interesting to me because it makes me wonder, 'What's not enough?'"</p>
      <p>Naturally enough, then, Morgan and Frost first met in Claridges for breakfast. At the next table were Robin Cook and Madeleine Albright, "probably discussing their autobiographies". As they got ready to leave, Frost stood up to say goodbye. "So I got up," Morgan recalls, "and in that ghastly dying moment where everyone has to introduce everyone to everyone else, Frosty introduced me as, 'One of our most promising playwrights - Colin Morgan.' It creased me up. But then, were that not perfect enough, Robin Cook said, "Of course," as he shook my hand. As if he'd heard of me. Very, very funny."</p>
      <p>Name aside, the irony is that Frost/Nixon is Morgan's first play. Until now, the writer has happily confined himself to film and television - the latter, he says, being particularly wonderful. "You can be far more challenging, articulate and intelligent writing for television than you can writing for the cinema."</p>
      <p>He's written a great deal, including the movie Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence, and, for ITV, The Jury, Colditz and Henry VIII, starring Ray Winstone. But Morgan is probably best known for The Deal, broadcast in 2003, directed by Stephen Frears and starring Michael Sheen and David Morrissey. It was an electrifying programme, an exploration of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's friendship, its subsequent disintegration and their pact for leadership of the Labour party.</p>
      <p>Frears and Morgan are following it with The Queen, which should prove just as captivating when it's screened on Channel 4 in the autumn. The Queen focuses upon the relationship between Her Majesty, played by Helen Mirren, and the prime minister, again played by Michael Sheen, in the aftermath of Princess Diana's death in 1997.</p>
      <p>Morgan says of his star: "In the first few days, she was Helen Mirren in a wig. But then she started inhabiting it more and more, and she suddenly became this rather squat piggy woman with enormous presence. She would walk on to the set and you would find yourself stiffening slightly. You minded your Ps and Qs and started saying things like, 'Goodness gracious.'"</p>
      <p>There's a common theme in The Deal, The Queen and now Frost/Nixon - the acquisition, exercise and loss of power. It's clearly of great fascination to Morgan, 43, who was born in south London to refugees from Europe. His father is a German Jew and his mother a Catholic Pole. They met in London, "both trying to reinvent themselves"; his father's real surname was Morgenthau. Morgan grew up speaking German and was, charmingly, nicknamed Fritz at school, "because the English are so broad-minded about that kind of thing". This outsider status, he thinks now, is what helps him to write so incisively about the powerful - those on the inside. "If you don't belong somewhere, that outsider status you have gives you perspective." He pauses. "Of course, another word for outsider is exile and that's not fun at all."</p>
      <p>Morgan has become expert at examining the machinations of the powerful. But while there are devastating moments of razor-sharp insight in Frost/Nixon, it's a surprisingly tender play, too - almost a love story. Frost, Morgan says, was worried he was some sort of vicious hatchet man, and while the writer does a formidable and funny impression of the broadcaster, he says he is very fond of him. "He is impossible not to like. Once I start writing about somebody, I become very protective of them."</p>
      <p>Morgan's portrayal of Frost's fearless bravura is in stark contrast to his depiction of Nixon - and it's a fascinating juxtaposition. While Frost has a gregarious effervescence and an indestructible self-confidence, Nixon is consumed with insecurity, self-destructive urges, paranoia.</p>
      <p>"Self-destruction is such an interesting thing for a dramatist, and what's particular to Nixon is how human the failings were that led to his downfall. I really think he was a man who could have had greatness in his grasp. Despite being in a totally unassailable position - he'd reached detente with the Chinese, he presided over economic stability at home, he was about to be re-elected by a massive landslide - he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. And if you look back over his career, he was a serial self-destructor. What he did with Watergate and the abuses of power were the actions of a man who, despite all evidence to the contrary, thought everyone was out to get him. He was so fabulously labyrinthine and tortured."</p>
      <p>As much as Frost/Nixon is concerned with the contrast between the two men, it's also about what unites them. Nixon was, of course, disgraced, but Frost's career was also on the slide in the US. And, as Morgan has Frost say in the play: "Success in America is unlike success anywhere else. And the emptiness, when it's gone . . . and the sickening thought that it's left you . . . that it's gone somewhere else . . . to someone else and will never come back."</p>
      <p>To guarantee Nixon's participation in the 1977 interview, Frost paid him $600,000 (in today's money, that would be at least $5m), as well as a share of the interview's profits. He might not have appeared so, but Frost was as desperate as Nixon. Indeed, Frost the character comes over as vain, oleaginous and occasionally downright creepy.</p>
      <p>"They were both desperate to be in the limelight," Morgan maintains, "and they both saw the interview as their last chance to assure their posterity. They were both consumed by ambition and ambition is always an indicator of dysfunction and pain. After all, how many well-adjusted ambitious people do you know? It brings us back to the notion of nothing ever being enough for Frost and Nixon's pursuit of a career which was contingent on being liked when he actually didn't know how to be liked. It's agony."</p>
      <p>The play also has significant contemporary resonance, describing, as it does, unfettered executive power; a president who proclaims: "When you're in office, you have to do a lot of things that are not, in the strictest sense of the law, legal"; and the amalgamation of politics and showbiz.</p>
      <p>Despite his penchant for research, Morgan resists the notion of an objective truth in Frost/Nixon or any of his TV work. He detests the term "docudrama". "Truth is an illusory notion. For Frost/Nixon, everyone I spoke to told the story their way. Even people in the room tell different versions. There's no one truth about what happened in those interviews, so I feel very relaxed about bringing my imagination to the piece. God knows everyone else has"</p>
      <p>Frost/Nixon opens at the Donmar Warehouse, London WC1, on August 10. Box office: 020-7369 1732.</p>
      <p>Correction</p>
      <p>An editing error in the piece headed She's back - and not a moment too soon for ITV, page 3, Media, yesterday, caused us to say that the new ITV-made Helen Mirren film The Queen, would be shown on Channel 4. In fact it will be on ITV1 next year after its cinema release.</p>
      <p>Correction-Date: August 22, 2006 Tuesday</p>

      <title>Trigger Article 50 on Breton tops - style tips for a strange summer</title>
      <subtitle>Fashion isn't exempt from the upheavals of the last few months. With that in mind, it's time to ditch your dungarees, lose the leopardprint and grab a kaftan</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Trigger article 50 on Breton tops</p>
      <p>The classic horizontal navy-and-white stripe T-shirt is the summer uniform of the 48%. The Breton is as at home in Cornwall or Norfolk as it is in France, as Boden as it as Bardot, and has always been more of a lifestyle statement than most wearers admit. It has a faint but distinct air of remainer refusenik about it now; and besides, its rosy-cheeked, wholesome vibe just isn't right for a summer of discontent. I know this is tough to accept, guys, but the people have spoken. Calls for a further referendum on the subject are at this point unhelpful.</p>
      <p>Leopard print has changed its spots</p>
      <p>The story of this strange month in politics has been that (a) old allegiances are being torn apart, and (b) we find ourselves aligned with people we never imagined ourselves in step with. Case in point: the arrival of a prime minister who owns no fewer than 10 pairs of leopard print shoes changes everything. Leopard print used to signal Primrose Hill house party; now it means cabinet meeting. It used to suggest you were a bit like Kate Moss. Now it hints you are a bit like Theresa May. Strange days.</p>
      <p>Remove all deck-of-a-yacht images from your summer moodboard</p>
      <p>For the last decade, the ultimate aspirational holiday images have been of yacht-life. The rise of the sleek black one-piece swimsuit is directly linked to how good it looks when snapped as you dive into the sea, and then climb back up the ladder. But the tawdry circumstances around Philip Green's purchase of the £100m, football-pitch-sized Lionheart superyacht have thrown shade on the whole yacht lifestyle. Instagramming from the lido in a bikini and a hoodie is, frankly, so much classier.</p>
      <p>Take a shirt to the beach</p>
      <p>When you are at the office, it is easy to raise a sceptical eyebrow at the concept of a bikini cover-up being a must-have. I mean, what exactly is the point of a gauzy, semi-transparent layer that doesn't even keep you warm, right? I'll tell you what the point is: it's for when you have to get up from your sunlounger approximately every 40 seconds to buy someone an ice-cream/find their other sandal/empty the dishwasher and you don't want to actually get dressed but you don't feel confident strutting around in a bikini. This cover-up cannot be a cardigan. If Taylor Swift can't look good on a beach in a cardigan while snogging Tom Hiddleston, the cardigan is finished. And the kaftan has been promoted to real-world living (see number 7), so it has to be an oversized shirt.</p>
      <p>Stand by Roksanda</p>
      <p>If you are going to buy a really posh dress this summer, make it a Roksanda dress. Because it's not her fault that Melania Trump wore Roksanda to make Michelle Obama's speech, sorry, her speech. The Trumps are not going to take one of our favourite British fashion designers from us without a fight. We still love you, Roks!</p>
      <p>Wear a polo shirt for posh</p>
      <p>The best-dressed champion at Centre Court this Wimbledon was Australian model Frances Aaternir, in a strawberries-and-cream pink Stella McCartney asymmetric polo shirt with matching skirt. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge's best outfit of the summer was her personalised polo shirt, worn at the America's Cup with faded black jeans and Adidas Pure Boost sneakers. Ditch the off-the-shoulder top for athleisure's new frontier. Just keep the collar turned down.</p>
      <p>Bring the kaftan back to the city</p>
      <p>If you have a tendency to over-shop in excitement pre-holiday, you will be familiar with the realisation that you have approximately 56 potential holiday outfits, but only 14 days of holiday and a 20k luggage allowance. Doh. The good news this summer is that the kaftan is being rehabilitated as a city-wear option. Ex-Vogue stylist Pippa Holt's kaftans are the ultimate trophy piece, with the price tag to match ; Melissa Odabash's Jackie Peach kaftan is slightly more affordable and will last many summers.</p>
      <p>Dungarees are over</p>
      <p>I don't know what to say about this, because I don't know how this happened. One minute, everyone was wearing them, then suddenly they were over. Anyway, just pointing this out.</p>
      <p>Wear longer-length shorts</p>
      <p>It hasn't all been bleak this summer. On the plus side, those dreadful "poke" shorts, where the shorts are so short that the pockets are visible on purpose, have finally died. This summer, your shorts should be mid-thigh length. For reference, see the shorts on the Ashish SS16 catwalk, or take a look at Prince George's commemorative third birthday photos, in which the young royal is nonchalantaly nailing the new Bermuda-length silhouette while simultaneously making a strong case for the wooden rope swing to replace the giant pool inflatable as the key photo prop for this summer.</p>
      <p>Dress to play Pokémon Go</p>
      <p>Forget raffia baskets and ankle-tie wedges. The unlikely combination of a heatwave and a craze for wandering the streets in a relentless search for virtual critters has made this a summer for trainers and backpacks. If you can track down a pair of Gucci trainers with an embroidered loveheart or pineapple, you win summer.</p>
      <p>Think Ghostbusters (the skirt suit, not the boilersuit)</p>
      <p>The skirt suit is having a moment this summer. Prime minister May's best look so far was the navy skirt suit she wore with a white scoop-neck blouse and pearl necklace, to meet with Angela Merkel ; meanwhile, the Ghostbusters style game is all about the prissy pleated skirt suit, which Kristen Wiig worries is "too sexy for academia".</p>
      <p>If all else fails, channel Alexa Chung</p>
      <p>In turbulent times, bastions of good old British values - common sense, dry humour, the importance of navy jumpers - are prized more than ever. Thank heavens for Alexa Chung. Just when everything seemed to be falling apart, she gave us all something to cling on to by Looking Awesome at Glastonbury. Dressed in a Hades "The Smiths" sweater, PVC jeans, Hunters and an old Barbour, Chung's Glasto-backstage look was the summer of discontent's answer to "Fashion is Indestructible", Cecil Beaton's 1941 photograph of a model in a Digby Morton suit next to the ruins of Temple, London. News that Chung will be launching her own label next year has been a ray of hope among the gloom. The world may be going to hell in a handcart, but the perfect high-waisted jeans are on their way.</p>
