      <title>US firms eye $400m investments in Zim</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ZIMBABWE is on the brink of securing nearly half a billion dollar investments in the health sector from a group of American firms that have since initiated regulation formalities with Harare.</p>
      <p>The investors are coming through Health Galaxy Park, an investment vehicle established by a team of technocrats from the University of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail can reveal that representatives form some of the American firms were in Harare recently to push for the US$400 million venture.</p>
      <p>Some of the American firms in the deal include Stanley Brothers Biotech, Waters Corp, Cancer Institute and Diabetic Relief which are big corporates in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and research.</p>
      <p>In an interview, University of Zimbabwe scientist, Professor Charles Maponga, who is part of the technocrats pioneering the project, said the Americans were fully committed to the successful implementation of the deal.</p>
      <p>'We have 19 American companies with a total commitment of US$400 million, who are waiting for all processes to be done so they can come and invest,' he said.</p>
      <p>'Of the 19 companies, four have since sent representatives to meet various investment authorities and attended a workshop we held recently.'</p>
      <p>Prof Maponga said one of the companies, Waters Corp, had donated medical equipment worth US$500 000 which was already being shipped into the country.</p>
      <p>'We are expecting equipment worth $US500 000 from Waters Corp to set up a pharmacology laboratory which will support local industry to analyse drugs and improve checks and balances on the drugs we dispense to patients.</p>
      <p>He said the equipment from Waters Corp will be installed at a Government laboratory.</p>
      <p>Prof Maponga said Health Galaxy Park was created with a view to rebuild national healthcare and improve biomedical research infrastructure.</p>
      <p>'We are saying the health model of Zimbabwe, which has been dependent on donations, is not sustainable; so we should go into a serious drive to attract investment in the health sector,' he said.</p>
      <p>'There has not been much investment in the medical sector in years and many machines have become obsolete.</p>
      <p>'The new Government has given us, technocrats, leeway to start running the show and we are pleased with that.'</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Sunday Mail in Harare recently Stanley Brothers Biotech vice president, Ms Sarah McMahon said they were targeting medical marijuana production.</p>
      <p>'We are coming in as a partner to offer our resources, where we can, to help establish the natural products division of Health Galaxy Park.</p>
      <p>'We want to educate people how to grow the plant (marijuana), using best practices and how to extract and process the product as well as carry out research,' she said.</p>

      <title>Women groups partner Govt in taming coronavirus</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>An alliance of over 50 women groups in Zimbabwe has established a coronavirus rapid response unit to complement Government initiatives in the fight against the pandemic.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sunday Mail, Women's Coalition of Zimbabwe (WCoZ) chairperson Ms Ronika Mumbire said the response was a result of the global magnitude of coronavirus, which needed concerted efforts.</p>
      <p>'The role of civil society remains critical at this point. In previous experiences, such as the cholera outbreak of 2008 to 2009, CSOs (civil society organisations) were responsible for awareness building. Our role has not changed much in the current crisis, but we have gone a step further,' she said.</p>
      <p>'We are actively engaged in developing daily situation reports, which help Government in assessing the effectiveness of measures taken to contain the virus and control the rate of disease outbreak in the country.'</p>
      <p>Ms Mumbire said in their latest situation report, WCoZ had noted with concern the issue of non-observance of social distancing and how it reversed gains made by Government. 'We recognise the need to enforce the law on the containment of Covid-19, however, on 2 April 2020, we noted with concern from our Bulawayo chapter, the manner in which offenders have been handled,' she said.</p>
      <p>'Those who breached the lockdown were taken to Bulawayo Central Police Station, in their large numbers, thereby defeating the whole purpose of social distancing.</p>
      <p>'(We are) aware that such actions expose both the police and the offenders to Covid-19, thereby resulting in a wider community spread and transmission. We urge law enforcement agents to be cautious when enforcing arrests.'</p>
      <p>Ms Mumbire also urged authorities to address issues of violence against women at community water points such as boreholes.</p>
      <p>She said in the face of the global health crisis, scarcity of reliable water provision remained one of the major drawbacks in fighting the pandemic. Recently, the High Court ordered the Harare City Council to provide repair and maintenance schedules for all dysfunctional boreholes in the city.</p>
      <p>This was after the Combined Harare Residents' Association (CHRA) made an urgent chamber application with the court citing unreliable water supply in the city.</p>

      <title>Digital tax headache for small economies</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Taxation of digital services like Facebook, e-Commerce, cloud services, video streaming, Twitter and Google advertising is a complex global problem.</p>
      <p>Countries like Zimbabwe, which are beneficiaries but not owners of global digital platforms, need due consideration to determine the tax policy. Recently Uganda imposed a US5c daily access tax, while Benin introduced a US0,8c per megabyte tax for social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>
      <p>Global digital firms leverage the nature of services and technology to minimise/remove payable tax.</p>
      <p>They register huge revenue in subsidiaries located in tax havens or low tax jurisdictions rather than countries where the actual sales happen. Profit is taken out in the form of royalties payable to a tax jurisdiction with lower tax rates, therefore reducing withholding tax at source.</p>
      <p>These tax reduction strategies are not new. Multinational companies have been doing this for decades.</p>
      <p>The intangible digital services distributed on global digital platforms have a more pervasive, rapid and profound tax impact than businesses with physical goods and distribution systems.</p>
      <p>A WhatsApp call is a typical over-the-top (OTT) service because it is made without the mobile operator's control or billing, as long as the subscriber has data.</p>
      <p>OTT refers to distribution of digital goods and services over the Internet without involvement of telecoms or broadcasting operators. Digital advertising involves three parties: the advertiser, a publisher such as Google and a consumer.</p>
      <p>Advertising revenue is realised when the consumer acts to generate a sale as a result of seeing the advert. A digital advert scenario can occur where the advertiser, the server where the advert is published, and the customer clicking the advert all reside in three different countries.</p>
      <p>Naturally the advert tax should be allocated to the location of the digital servers, services employees and residence of consumer that initiated the revenue transaction.</p>
      <p>The challenge is how to obtain location-user location information and to assign taxable revenue contributions across the three tax jurisdictions in this scenario.</p>
      <p>Some people advocate that e-commerce should be tax exempt. But that disadvantages traditional retailers.</p>
      <p>E-commerce growth projections show potential source of tax revenue in future. Unfortunately, for a country like Zimbabwe, setting up the enforcement and operations to collect e-commerce tax is difficult and the costs can outweigh the revenues.</p>
      <p>Facebook is headquartered in the US and provides social network functionality and messaging to consumers free of charge. It has offices in other countries that provide sales and training.</p>
      <p>It uses digital platforms located in its headquarters or selected subsidiaries to process sales contracts and to receive local advertisers' payments.</p>
      <p>There is generally no taxable income declared in the sales offices. The local office only pays taxes related to local staff and any services offered to headquarters.</p>
      <p>For instance, in 2012 Facebook earned £223 million in the UK but paid no income tax.</p>
      <p>As such, countries like Chile withhold a 35 percent tax on digital advertisers at the time an invoice is paid to an operator like Facebook.</p>
      <p>Google uses selected subsidiaries such as Google Ireland to register sales contracts instead of the actual country where the digital advert sale took place.</p>
      <p>Google Ireland does not pay the local 12,5 percent tax rate, because the revenues are translated to royalty fees for intellectual property and transferred to a Dutch subsidiary. The Netherlands transfers the money to Bermuda, which has no corporate tax.</p>
      <p>Argentina's capital Buenos Aires imposed a three percent income tax law on all foreign online subscription services from companies like Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Spotify and iTunes.</p>
      <p>The law didn't allow passing of the tax to consumers.</p>
      <p>The idea was to avoid taxing consumers but rather collect taxes from digital content distributors that do not pay corporate taxes in Argentina.</p>
      <p>In addition the tax offered protection to locally based streaming services firms that pay income taxes in Argentina.</p>
      <p>The government had to ask credit card issuers to collect subscriber information and to withhold the tax since none of the digital content companies had no operation and presence in Argentina.</p>
      <p>The digital operator collects the tax from credit card transactions and then delivers to the city. However, in the collection, storing and delivering of digital sales information, the citizens' privacy rights are infringed.</p>
      <p>The French government introduced a two percent tax on foreign video on demand operators.</p>
      <p>In Chile a 35 percent tax on gross amounts invoiced by the operator to advertisers is subtracted and remitted to government.</p>
      <p>A digital taxation policy can maximise tax revenue from the exponentially growing digital economy which is poised to be the de-facto future business model.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the policy can minimise digital taxation to corporates and consumers leading to improved economic growth.</p>
      <p>Minimal taxation on the digital sector triggers has macro- economic growth spill-overs that are larger than the taxes.</p>
      <p>To arrive at an optimal digital tax policy, a few distortions should be considered.</p>
      <p>Firstly a digital tax policy should accommodate distortions between telecommunications and internet firms in the digital business.</p>
      <p>Telecommunications companies are generally heavily taxed for reasons including easy of taxation and collection, and double taxation cases.</p>
      <p>For instance, mobile user traveling outside the country of residence pays the home operator including local VAT.</p>
      <p>When the international roaming partner invoices the subscriber's home network, the cost includes a visited country VAT.</p>
      <p>The double taxation in international mobile roaming results in up to 40 percent increase in the final retail price.</p>
      <p>In Europe and China, Internet firms have a five-point lower effective tax rate than telecommunications companies.</p>
      <p>In emerging economies, the effective tax rate is between seven and 14 points lower. This distortion is important to note given that telecoms companies compete with internet firms in the market.</p>
      <p>Secondly, taxation policy should address asymmetry between telecommunications firms and global players in the digital ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Telecommunication deploy in-country infrastructure which creates a permanent establishment making them liable to a tax burden.</p>
      <p>Global digital firms like Facebook, Twitter and Google use the telecommunications firms' infrastructure to service customers thereby avoiding presence in countries outside the headquarters.</p>
      <p>They use distributed skeleton sales offices which register sales outside the country to reduce the tax liability.</p>
      <p>OTT operators do not even have a physical presence outside their headquarters.</p>
      <p>For instance, reports show that Facebook, Google, Twitter, Skype, LinkedIn and Netflix paid an effective tax rate of 11,78 percent in Latin America while telecommunication firms paid 33 percent.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, locally based digital companies pay tax but have to compete with global digital players offering service with economies of scale and a tax advantage.</p>
      <p>The national digital industries should be protected while enabling the benefits of global digital platforms.</p>
      <p>The EU utilises the IP address of the consumer's computer, or the credit card address, to determine the tax jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Japan has a tax law that requires foreign digital products companies to register with tax authorities and pay taxes as a condition to distribute products in the country.</p>
      <p>The fourth dimension of taxation asymmetry refers to in-country comparison of tax burden of the telecommunications and digital sector, compared to the other sectors.</p>
      <p>While the telecommunication sector is a social-economic growth foundation, its taxation burden is larger than other industries.</p>
      <p>In fact, the telecommunication effective tax rate should one of the lowest in the country to maximise technology adoption.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the effective tax rate for the telecommunication and digital sector companies is 7 percentage points higher than the media sector.</p>
      <p>In emerging economies, the tourism sector effective tax rate is five percent lower than telecommunication and digital services.</p>
      <p>Digital global platforms have a profound impact on both Internet adoption and the digital economy growth.</p>
      <p>They are engines that spur economic growth and enable access to the global markets for economies of scale.</p>
      <p>Taxation policy should maximise these overall benefits while ensuring fair tax has been paid Zimbabwe should carefully craft digital tax policies that address potential tax distortions while</p>

      <title>Maintaining the National Heroes Acre</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Emmanuel Kafe</p>
      <p>The hilltop has a commanding view of Harare, features a huge bronze statue of three fighters and boasts black marble and granite flourishes.</p>
      <p>It is quiet and Zimbabwe's most exclusive neighbourhood, but once there, those who move in never leave.</p>
      <p>An area and a place where the former Head of State, Mr Robert Mugabe, would deliver bombastic speeches denouncing his foes.</p>
      <p>The National Heroes Acre is a burial ground for those who lived and died for Zimbabwe. Construction began in 1981, a year after independence, and continues on a hill overlooking Harare.</p>
      <p>Within this compound are men and women who work, and have seen the mighty and powerful being buried with grace and pride. They keep the place well-manicured.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail Society toured this majestic place last week.</p>
      <p>Fortuitously, we met and had a chat with the compound's longest-serving staff, the hands behind the maintenance of the National Heroes Acre.</p>
      <p>Sabastian Mukono (38) has been manicuring the Heroes Acre for more than 16 years. Mukono works in the maintenance department and started off as a casual worker in 2001, only to be formally employed in 2004 as maintenance staff and guide.</p>
      <p>'My duties are rehabilitation of graves, grass cutting and road maintenance at the main shrine,' Mukono said.</p>
      <p>He added: 'I have seen sturdy and mighty men of valour being buried here and I have shaken hands with great men like the President of China.''</p>
      <p>A father of two, very friendly and accommodating, the man said he enjoys his work and feels motivated to be one of those people who help send the mighty to their resting places.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he might consider leaving a job he loves so passionately, should a better offer materialise, Mukono said: 'The conditions here are favourable and I appreciate the peace associated with working at the Heroes Acre. I do not see myself working anywhere else,' he said.</p>
      <p>During the chat, Mukono walked us through the rustic 140-acre grounds. He explained the wildlife that is found in this place, which includes monkeys and giant snakes.</p>
      <p>We came to a stop at the imposing black granite, bronze and stone shrine. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier represents the heroism of Zimbabweans who died to free this country from colonial bondage, whose bodies were never found.</p>
      <p>Today, their remains lie scattered in valleys, caves, disused mines, shallow and deep graves and many other unknown mass graves in Zimbabwe. We looked the other way at something more arresting. In the distance we could see a towering pillar.</p>
      <p>'Everything here is symbolic,' said Mukono.</p>
      <p>The tower was designed to make one feel like an ant looking at an elephant. Some of the designs reminds one of the Great Zimbabwe. It came as no surprise to learn that the Heroes Acre's design team included some locals and seven architects from North Korea.</p>
      <p>From the air, Mukono said, the mausoleum (grave yard) is meant to resemble an AK47 rifle, the most potent weapon in the guerrilla war for independence, with the central stairway as the barrel, the obelisk as the bayonet and the graves as the bullets in their chambers.</p>
      <p>'An obelisk is that tall pillar towering upwards and it's the one that flicker at night. That obelisk is 40 metres high. The white top is an eternal flame. Whenever you come across the flame flickering, it depicts the spirit of independence. It also says to the people of Zimbabwe keep on working hard for the cause of national purity. This is the National Heroes Acre, whereby the gallant sons and daughters who sacrificed their lives for our freedom are laid to rest,' said Mukono.</p>
      <p>He pointed to Stalinesque bronze friezes depicting the African nationalist war for independence.</p>
      <p>In one scene, white Rhodesian soldiers, wielding rifles and batons and marshalling a ferocious hound, terrorise a black woman who has fallen to the ground, a baby clinging to her back.</p>
      <p>Above the friezes sit statues of the Zimbabwean national emblem, the African fish eagle.</p>
      <p>We climbed up the steps of the monument, comprising tiered black granite and cobblestones that represent the Great Zimbabwean walls. Mukono pointed to the spot where Mugabe would habitually proclaim, 'Zimbabwe will never be a colony again!' and the gaudy bronze statue of the Unknown Soldier, depicting a male solider with a flag, a male soldier with a bazooka, and a female soldier with an AK47 - a symbol of the representation of men and women during the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>There is also a well built tomb for Arthur Guy Clutton-Brock, a British social worker who continued to assist the independence struggle even after he was expelled by Ian Smith's government. He was the first white man to be declared a national hero.</p>
      <p>Ms Rumbidzai Bvira, who oversees the maintenance staff, says the upkeep of the national shrine is a process that runs throughout the year.</p>
      <p>'Our maintenance can be divided into two main aspects which are the gallery and the shrine. These two have to be presentable at any given point and time since we receive visitors throughout the year,' Ms Bvira said.</p>
      <p>She also emphasised that the National Heroes Acre is open to the public. She said people are frightened to visit due to the presence of the police.</p>
      <p>'The police is there to protect and not block people from entering.'</p>
      <p>With the annual Heroes Day holiday on tomorrow, the place will awaken to the sounds of the rustling wind and chirping birds before these natural notes are replaced by a cacophony and camaraderie of hundreds of local and foreign dignitaries as they join in the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Opening daily between 8am and 4.30pm, including weekends and public holidays, the National Heroes Acre is a perfect place for one to familiarise themselves with a critical part of Zimbabwe's history. Currently more than 125 national heroes and heroines are interred at the National Heroes Acre. These are not only those that gave birth to Zimbabwe through the liberation struggle but also those who were instrumental in shaping the country post independence. Among those who rest at the centre is the late Father Zimbabwe and former Vice President, Dr Joshua Nkomo.</p>
      <p>The Heroes Acre pays due homage to these individuals who are no longer with us, but are remembered and honoured for their great works.</p>
      <p>It is imperative that Zimbabweans of generations to come must know of the sacrifices made by these heroes and heroines such that their legacies may never fade. The National Heroes Acre accommodates 5 000 people seated in the public space and each year meets this capacity during the Heroes Day celebrations as well as during more sombre moments when Zimbabweans come to pay their last respects at fallen comrades' funerals.</p>

      <title>We are living in a prison</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>If ever there was need for a revolution - a real revolution - it is now.</p>
      <p>We are really living in a self-made, man-made prison.</p>
      <p>We can no longer continue like this, and it is time 'we cast off the shackles'.</p>
      <p>The most mean, darkest, unforgiving and formidable prison in the world is the mind. Bishop Lazi believes that while we managed to change our political hardware through the November 2017 transition, the software - the old mindset - was unfortunately left intact.</p>
      <p>An old mindset dangerously breeds inertia, while a new mindset engenders traction.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it is the old mindset that seems to drive some gremlins in the civil service that wittingly or unwittingly continue to frustrate ongoing reform efforts.</p>
      <p>They sing about a new dispensation while clothed in robes of the old dispensation.</p>
      <p>They righteously declare war against corruption while giving succour to the corrupt.</p>
      <p>And this is precisely the reason why some pockets of Government continue to be cesspools of slothfulness, inefficiency and corruption.</p>
      <p>On October 25 this year, Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) chair DrElasto Hilarious Mugwadi, who also doubles up as a Public Protector and Ombudsman, made a less than hilarious observation about the conduct of some civil servants.</p>
      <p>'. . . we are saying it is not only the Registrar-General's Office which requires re-exposure through retraining.</p>
      <p>'It is almost the entire public service, all of the public service institutions . . . You will find individuals who are really up to scratch, but there are others, including seniors, who are only interested in gatekeeping, which should be a thing of the past, and we are going to continuously get this addressed . . .</p>
      <p>'Mind you, we are moving from one generation of administration - the old administration - to the new dispensation.'</p>
      <p>Dissonance</p>
      <p>And the re-training that the good Doc is obviously talking about is typically a software upgrade that entails radical changing of mindsets in order to programmatically make them adaptable to the call of this generation - to rediscover the path to prosperity and lift millions out of poverty.</p>
      <p>As it currently stands, it is quite understandable why some might view Government's promise of reform and prosperity as disingenuous rhetoric and mere grandstanding, because on one end of the dichotomy we have an indefatigable President ED, whom even the late Cde Robert Mugabe at his most sulkiest on the eve of last year's elections described as 'a hard worker', while on the other end we have a bureaucracy that is teeming with laggards.</p>
      <p>And the resultant dissonance is quite apparent. If you are familiar with village life, you would definitely know the ignominy of trying to get any sort of work done by yoking together seasoned oxen and those that are being tamed.</p>
      <p>It is incredibly very tiring work, for the yet-to-be-tamed young oxen would always put up frustratingly dogged resistance.</p>
      <p>Revolution</p>
      <p>But such dogged resistance to change is not uncommon. Chinese journalist and author Wu Xiaobo, who studied the Asian country's momentous transition from an economic backwater to the world's second-biggest economy in the 30-year period to 2008, reasons that 'any major change in history must be preceded by a change in the people's conceptual framework'.</p>
      <p>'After a full 10 years of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), all normal functioning of the country (China) had been destroyed, including the people's ability to think creatively and clearly.</p>
      <p>'People's minds were in the rigid grip of what was called 'extreme leftist thinking'. For many years, the country had been closed to outside information, 'locked up', which affected the psychological makeup of its population,' said Xiaobo in his book 'China Emerging: 1978-2008'.</p>
      <p>This is the China a 74-year-old Deng Xiaoping - credited as the father of China's economic miracle - inherited when he took over leadership in 1978.</p>
      <p>Like ED has done, Deng literally flung China's door open to foreign direct investment and started re-engaging erstwhile friends and foes alike.</p>
      <p>Initially, investors who were hyper-curious of this formerly closed society rushed in, but they were generally disappointed with the work ethic of the Chinese then.</p>
      <p>Among those who were disappointed was Jay Matthews, a journalist with The Washington Post, who wrote: 'As in most factories in China, workers at the Guilin silk factory are not putting much effort into their work. . . This relaxed work attitude is going to be a major obstacle to the modernisation of this most populous nation on earth.'</p>
      <p>He was not the only one. A Hong Kong scholar who visited Guangzhou in 1979 disconcertingly discovered the inefficiencies and slothfulness of Chinese society then.</p>
      <p>He later recounted how he shockingly realised that it actually took three people to repair the plaster on a small wall that was near to where he was staying.</p>
      <p>In fact, one held the bucket, another applied the plaster and the third just stood by to watch.</p>
      <p>Kikikiki. Doesn't this sound familiar.</p>
      <p>In this part of the world, we see this every day; it is actually a lifestyle.</p>
      <p>This is why Deng Xiaoping later exhorted the Chinese to 'cast off the shackles that bind our spirit . . . we need to bring about a great emancipation in our way of thinking.'</p>
      <p>And today, all we know about the Chinese is their ant-like industry and superhuman work ethic.</p>
      <p>It all began with a change in attitude.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa's spokesperson, Cde George Charamba, could not have put it any better during a Capitalk FM radio programme on January 10 this year when he observed; 'A new era is not made by declaration, but by change of mindset and routine.</p>
      <p>'This is exactly where we are lagging behind. We have people who are proclaiming a new era, but still have an old mindset.</p>
      <p>'We just have to re-invent ourselves, not only as Government, but as the private sector and every citizen of this country so that we make the new era a reality on the ground.'</p>
      <p>Bishop Lazarus believes that we need a revolution to unlearn the decadent habits of the past and repurpose our minds for the onerous task that lies ahead.</p>
      <p>And, of course, we need to re-invent our work ethic to give tailwinds to our current push to prosperity.</p>
      <p>We really cannot afford to be slothful.</p>
      <p>Proverbs 24: 30-34 counsels: 'I went past the field of a sluggard, past the vineyard of someone who has no sense; thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins. I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw: A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest - and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.'</p>
      <p>Momentum</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is on an inexorable march to success, and those who doubt this simply have to look at the key milestones that have been recorded this year, notwithstanding the current power shortages and associated challenges.</p>
      <p>In October alone, exports came in at a whoPping US$483 million - close to half a billion dollars - which is quite substantial considering our circumstances.</p>
      <p>Also, in the first nine months of the year, export receipts jumped by 69 percent to US$224,4 million from US$133 million a year earlier. Those who resist change, the gremlins in our midst, risk being swept away by the unstoppable forces of history.</p>
      <p>As German historian and philosopher of history Oswald Spengler noted in his work 'The Decline of the West': 'Individuals perform the duties arranged by the inevitable forces of history. Those who are willing participants lead the way; those who are not willing are simply dragged along.'</p>
      <p>Beware of being dragged along.</p>
      <p>Bishop out!</p>

      <title>Sustainable development a key consideration</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Company directors, as responsible corporate citizens, should not just focus on balance sheets and profits, but maintain a balance between the need to make profits on one hand and meeting legitimate expectations of society on the other hand, to ensure sustainable development for the benefit of current and future generations.</p>
      <p>Vision 2030 requires captains of industry and commerce to be astute and patriotic and take an active role, not only in economic and social development, but also in environmental conservation of Zimbabwe as the country strives to create middle-income status by 2030.</p>
      <p>The recent human, economic, social and environmental damage caused by Cyclone Idai across the eastern parts of Zimbabwe and the drought we are currently experiencing is clear testimony of the effects of climate change and what can befall us if we do not take heed of environmental conservation.</p>
      <p>While the link between sustainable development and corporate governance may not look obvious, it exists.</p>
      <p>Companies are legal personas, meaning they have a juristic personality and cannot act as physical living persons. This is why companies are represented by directors who act on their behalf.</p>
      <p>Company directors, therefore, have a legal obligation and corporate responsibility to ensure that companies they represent, which physically operate within communities and natural environments, should and must embrace sustainable development issues.</p>
      <p>Directors cannot talk of good corporate governance if they do not act responsibly by balancing business objectives, on one hand, with social, economic and environmental objectives, on the other hand, which form the core of sustainable development.</p>
      <p>Concept of sustainable development</p>
      <p>Sustainable development, according to the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), simply refers to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
      <p>More broadly, sustainable development encompasses three interdependent and reinforcing pillars, which are: economic development, social development and environmental protection.</p>
      <p>Misconception</p>
      <p>The general misconception is that sustainable development focuses solely on environmental protection issues and is the business of Government, local authorities and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p>Sustainable development goes beyond the environment and also hinges on economic and social development. Companies, as engines for economic growth and social development, act as agents in creating employment and alleviating poverty.</p>
      <p>Global corporate governance standards now require company directors to look into sustainable reporting issues, something that was new a decade ago.</p>
      <p>In other words, sustainability should now be engraved in the DNA of company directors.</p>
      <p>Corporate governance codes in most African countries now incorporate integrated sustainable reporting standards.</p>
      <p>For example, the Zimbabwe National Code on Corporate Governance (2015) contains provisions on Integrated Sustainable Reporting (ISR).</p>
      <p>The South African King IV Report on Corporate Governance, a globally acclaimed code, has a very elaborate section that provides guidelines on ISR.</p>
      <p>Independent evaluation</p>
      <p>In line with best practices, in certain jurisdictions, companies are now required to engage advisers to carry out independent evaluations to ensure that they comply with integrated sustainable reporting standards.</p>
      <p>Guidelines on reporting on sustainable development issues, such as those enumerated in the King IV report cited above, now require companies to have a formal sustainability reporting and assurance process at least once annually.</p>
      <p>Metamorphosis</p>
      <p>Corporate governance globally has undergone a metamorphosis in recent years as focus has shifted from simply how companies are directed and controlled to broader sustainable development issues.</p>
      <p>In this article, we will deliberately look at sustainable development more from the angle of environmental conservation as this is an area where most corporates in Zimbabwe are lagging behind in terms of investment.</p>
      <p>Environmental conservation has been looked at as an issue usually associated with governments and regulatory authorities such as Environmental Management Authority (Ema) who have a statutory role on environmental management and ensuring adherence to domestic and international protocols on the environment.</p>
      <p>Pressure from governments, green movements, consumers, and corporate governance protocols, inter alia, has compelled companies to re-evaluate their business processes, labour policies, manufacturing and emission standards, use of chemicals and fertilisers, waste management, quality standards of products and so on, to ensure that they do not harm people and the environment.</p>
      <p>In the European Union (EU), for example, a company that does not meet sustainable development standards is perceived negatively by investors and consumers.</p>
      <p>The risks of reputational damage, losing a business licence or boycott of products by consumers could happen to a company if it is not compliant to sustainable development standards.</p>
      <p>Environmental risk management</p>
      <p>Best corporate governance practices require company directors to pay attention to environmental risk management factors and come up with policies to mitigate such risks.</p>
      <p>In Africa, financial institutions, especially banks, have been on the forefront when it comes to adoption of environmental risk management.</p>
      <p>In managing environmental financial risks - risks caused by climate change -there is an emerging trend wherein certain financial institutions now require more disclosures from companies on their green credentials; for example, green investments and greenhouse gas emissions, as part of the 'green credit rating system'.</p>
      <p>The greening of the financial system is a concept that has recently emerged and it is becoming necessary for companies to have good green credentials to enable them to access capital from financial institutions on favourable terms.</p>
      <p>Nigeria, through its Green Bond Market Development Programme in 2017, became the first country in Africa to issue a sovereign green bond, certified under the climate bonds standard, raising US$29 million at its inauguration year.</p>
      <p>In April 2019, Access Bank of Nigeria became the first corporate bank in Africa to launch the green bonds certified under the climate bonds standard, under auspices of the globally renowned UK-based organisation called Climate Bonds Initiative.</p>
      <p>In fact, Access Bank issued a 15-year, 15,5 percent fixed interest rate green bond, which raised US$41 million (15 billion naira).</p>
      <p>Also, Nedbank has become the first bank in South Africa to issue a Renewable Energy Bond.</p>
      <p>The instrument opened for auction on April 24 2019.</p>
      <p>Nedbank will apply investment proceeds to support solar and wind renewable projects, which have potential to deliver long-term sustainable energy solutions to South Africa.</p>
      <p>Product certification standards</p>
      <p>In Africa, company directors, especially those in large-scale export horticulture and agro-industries, are increasingly becoming aware of certification standards required for agricultural products if they are to penetrate lucrative European markets.</p>
      <p>For example, Fairtrade International - which is represented by the Nairobi, Kenya-based Fairtrade Africa - is the world's largest and most recognised independent ethical certification system, focusing mainly on trading of agricultural products.</p>
      <p>Fairtrade contributes significantly to sustainable development by ensuring that all Fairtrade certified products are sustainably produced by its network of producers scattered around the world.</p>
      <p>The five dimensions of Fairtrade certification system hinge on: economic criteria (fair prices), social criteria (fair working conditions), organisational criteria (governance), environmental criteria (sustainable environmental management) and awareness-raising criteria (educational).</p>
      <p>One of the requirements of Fairtrade certification process (FLOCERT) is that the entire supply chain of products (producer, processor, exporter, importer, manufacturer, distributor, trader et cetera) up to where the product is in the hands of the consumer has to be certified.</p>
      <p>Only then can a product be bought or sold as a Fairtrade product.</p>
      <p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</p>
      <p>CSR goes beyond making donations to charity.</p>
      <p>From a sustainable development point of view, being a 'responsible corporate citizen' means that a company has to strike a balance between its economic, social and environmental responsibilities in order to enhance the standing of the company at the marketplace and in society.</p>
      <p>CSR is about demonstrating the value that a company brings to society and gaining the trust of stakeholders that operations are conducted in a responsible and sustainable way.</p>
      <p>Sustainability issues should thus be integrated into a company's strategy, processes, systems and procedures.</p>
      <p>In Africa, we are beginning to see an emerging trend whereby regulatory bodies are starting to put in place regulations that compel companies to take into account sustainable development factors.</p>
      <p>As highlighted above, trending corporate governance practices now require company directors to maintain a balance between the need to make profits on one hand, and meeting legitimate expectations of society on the other hand, to ensure sustainable development for the benefit of current and future generations.</p>

      <title>How one could be ZIPRA, without being ZAPU</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Last week, Comrade Agrippah Gava (born 1956) narrated how ZIPRA gunned down Rhodesian Viscounts in 1978 and 1979 and went on to give details about ZIPRA's plan after this attack.</p>
      <p>In this interview with our Deputy Editor Munyaradzi Huni, Cde Conary speaks about how Rhodesian forces massacred over 100 defenceless refugees at Chikumbi Camp in Zambia and how he saw a fellow comrade whose stomach had been ripped open by a bomb kept on calling for help, but was ignored by the medics. It sends shivers down the spine.</p>
      <p>MH: Comrade, you indicated earlier on that you saw horrific scenes at Chikumbi Camp when it was attacked by Rhodesian forces. Can you tell us more about what you saw and what exactly happened?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: What happened was that it was early morning. From nowhere Rhodesian planes suddenly appeared and they started bombing this camp. The commander of this Rhodesian operation was called Greenleader. From the helicopter, he was actually giving command to the Zambian Airforce to stay put on the ground and never to attempt to fight them back by coming into the airspace. I vividly remember him with his hoarse voice saying 'eeehhh, this is Greenleader, we are not after you the Zambians! We are after the Rhodesian renegades stationed 10 km North of Lusaka! And therefore we are warning you, don't come into the airspace!' This was even reported on the news at 8pm that day through their Rhodesian war communique. So they bombed that camp.</p>
      <p>There was no protection for anyone. This was a refugee camp. There was no training taking place at this camp. This was just 10 km from Lusaka. It was just a transit camp. So defenceless people were massacred. Some ran away and escaped but many were killed. You could see body parts scattered all over the place. It was terrible and horrific.</p>
      <p>MH: When this bombardment was taking place, where were you?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: I was there inside the camp. I also had to run for dear life. All I know is that in that maze of confusion, bombardment and death, we managed to get out of the camp. The first bombs are the ones that killed many people. The Rhodesians were also dropping napalm drums, people being roasted like meat. There was nothing we could do to help. We could not even fight back. Like I told you very few people had guns and there were all light machines guns.</p>
      <p>After this bombardment, there came a time to ferry the injured to hospital and bury the dead. It was just too horrific. Ambulances came and the injured were taken to Lusaka, at the University Teaching Hospital. But as the injured were being picked up from the scene, I saw this comrade would stomach had been ripped open. You could see all his intestines and all hanging outside. But he was not dead. He was calling for assistance. The medics had realized that this comrade was going to die and taking him into an ambulance was going to be a waste of space. They left him there calling for help.</p>
      <p>It was not only him, many were left calling for help but their condition showed that it was a matter of time before they died. I tell you such images never get out of your mind. They live forever. The medics reasoned that it was better to assist someone with high chances of survival. It was terrible I tell you. The lungs had been cut out, the liver in pieces but the comrade was able to call for help. What do you do?</p>
      <p>This happened even at the war front. We got reports were some comrades would ask their fellow comrades to finish them off after being injured in a battle.</p>
      <p>MH: How does this horror affect the mind?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Anyone who has gone through this needs rehabilitation. This horror affects you the whole of your life. Up to now we have comrades troubled by hallucinations from the war. Those pictures never get out of their minds. Zimbabwean freedom fighters need a lot of rehabilitation. They saw a lot which was not supposed to be seen by a human being. Unfortunately, there was nothing like rehabilitation. You look today and think war veterans are normal. They are not. They can't be. It's not all war veterans who are normal. They have not been treated. The psychological effects of the war are still fresh and haunting them.</p>
      <p>MH: We will come to that issue towards the end of the interview. So those comrades who died during this battle, how were they buried?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: The Zambians provided us with caterpillars and we buried them in mass graves. We picked up human parts that were scattered all over the place. I don't even know the exact number of comrades we lost during this bombardment, but I should think the number was over 100.</p>
      <p>MH: Comrade, when you see such horror, do you cry?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: We were no longer crying.</p>
      <p>MH: Why?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: That is what death can do. You lose the heart of crying. Even the training prepared us for this. We were trained not to cry. Sometimes the war turned you into someone who didn't even smile.</p>
      <p>MH: In ZIPRA as you buried these comrades, would you conduct any rituals?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: There were no rituals. Things like ancestral spirits and so on, no we didn't do all that.</p>
      <p>MH: As ZIPRA what did you believe in as you fought the liberation struggle?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: We believed that if someone is dead, he is dead that's all. We didn't believe that there is life after death. Even when I came back from the liberation struggle I was like that. I believed that life is something you describe through historical materialism. Death is just a change of form. We believed that we had to fight the war ourselves. There was no ancestor to help us.</p>
      <p>MH: Let's turn to another issue. Do you have a close comrade you lost during the liberation struggle?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: No, I don't have.</p>
      <p>MH: Why?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: I think it had to do with a lot of hardening. I was never attached to someone to an extent that if they die I would drop down no.</p>
      <p>MH: But what does the word comrade mean?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Yes, it means comrade in arms but as you know at war people die. Did you watch the Second World War? Do you know that as we fought during the liberation struggle, there were sell-outs? Selous Scouts? People who were sent to infiltrate us so that we could be killed by the Rhodesian forces. When you identify these people, what do you do? That is your answer.</p>
      <p>MH: Now that you have spoken about sell-outs. Tell us how you would deal with sell-outs?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Some would be handed over to the Zambians who would deal with them. I don't know what happened at other camps (laughs).</p>
      <p>MH: Tell us a bit more about the ZIPRA tactics regarding fighting the war.</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: The fighting concept of a guerilla is hit and run. You don't have to waste manpower which has been trained and guns that had come as gifts from other countries. This is why the guerilla had to be thoroughly trained. As guerillas, the main strategy was to ambush the enemy, hit and run. The weigh down the enemy. A guerilla is not a force that takes over territory. There was now the grand strategy of a regular force being prepared at the rear. This regular force was supposed to be the occupying force, the conquering force. This force liberates territories.</p>
      <p>MH: How would you deal with cases of indiscipline during the liberation struggle?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: I can't really say in our case there was a lot of indiscipline. Most of the indiscipline was at the war front. There are some comrades who when they were given guns, they would not take orders from their commanders. They became dissidents. We had people who when they came to the front, started robbing buses, shops and so on. The command at the rear would really be worried. To solve this problem, we had some commanders who would go to the war front and put things in order.</p>
      <p>MH: As ZIPRA which countries supplied you with most of the ammunition?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: It was the USSR, West Germany and Czechoslovakia.</p>
      <p>MH: You were one of the deputy commanders in charge of artillery until when?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Until sometime before the Lancaster House talks. After that operation to hit Mana Pools was conducted, the chief of artillery was imprisoned by the Zambians.</p>
      <p>MH: Why?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Because that operation had created some problems on the Kariba and the Zambians were not happy about it. So they arrested him after confronting the ZIPRA High Command. The ZIPRA High Command handed over the Chief of Artillery, Andrew Ndlovu and he was put in jail. He was only released when Lancaster House was over.</p>
      <p>MH: As one of the deputies, how did that make you feel?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: It really was a drawback but we continued to operate.</p>
      <p>MH: So after his arrest did you take over?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: No. I didn't take over but on everything that was being done in relation to artillery, the Chief of Staff was now consulting me.</p>
      <p>MH: How was the relationship between ZIPRA and the Zambian government?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: It was a very close relationship because at each and every ZIPRA camp, there was maybe a platoon of Zambians. We also had our battalions being trained by the Zambians at Mulungushi. On the political front, the relationship was also very mutual.</p>
      <p>MH: There is talk that the Zambian government at that time supported ZIPRA and not ZANLA. Was this true?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: I don't really know much about that but as I said earlier on, can you go and read about the liberation movements in Southern Africa. You will hear about what were called 'Authentic and non-Authentic Liberation Movements.'</p>
      <p>MH: No, comrade tell us more yourself?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: No, go and read for yourself. All I can tell you is that in Angola there was MPLA and Unita; in South Africa there was ANC and there was PAC. If you go and read you will discover a lot about these liberation movements. Each and every country had what were called authentic and non-authentic political parties. The authentic parties were preferred by the groups of countries that supported the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>MH: ZANLA and ZANU were riddled by divisions during the war. What was the situation like in ZAPU and ZIPRA?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: There were no major divisions, but like any organization there was tribalism. You can call it tribalism, you can call it ethnicity. People sometimes would group according to their ethnic background. For example when Rex Nhongo left ZIPRA and went to ZANLA. You are aware that Rex Nhongo was ZIPRA trained? Why did he and others leave ZIPRA? Of course some left when FROLIZ was formed, but why did James Chikerema leave ZAPU? You need to research more on these things. Chikerema comes from Kutama. Why did he leave ZAPU to form FROLIZ together with Nathan Shamuyarira?</p>
      <p>MH: Was ethnicity an issue in ZIPRA?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary? It was not a pronounced issue but it would occur. That is why people like Rex Nhongo left. When Rex left, he went on to conduct popular battles under ZANLA.</p>
      <p>MH: But you didn't think of leaving despite the fact that other Shonas were leaving?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: No, no, no. It never crossed my mind because when I saw Joshua Nkomo coming with members of his Central Committee, the majority were Shona speaking people. There were people like Willie Musarurwa, Msika, Msipa and so on. That is why Nkomo was called 'Chibwe Chitedza.'That was not a Ndebele nickname. Even the ZIPRA High Command was full of Shona people. There was Ambrose Mutinhiri, with high rank among the commanders. You had Masengo who later become Zimbabwe's ambassador in Botswana after independence. He was the chief of training in ZIPRA. There was Eric Nyawera from Nyanga, there was Emmanuel Siziba, this was his Chimurenga name but he was not Ndebele speaking at all. At the end of the day you also had me. A Shona from Zvimba here.</p>
      <p>I never thought of crossing from ZIPRA to ZANLA because I was never a politician. I was never a politician. I was a school child who joined ZIPRA, the fighting force and not ZAPU, the politicians.</p>
      <p>MH: Did you play any role during the Lancaster House talks?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: I didn't play any role at Lancaster. This was for commanders like Lookout Masuku Most of the comrades who went to Lancaster were not soldiers. They were party people.</p>
      <p>MH: Can you clarify what you mean they were party people and not soldiers?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: ZAPU was the political party. ZIPRA was the armed wing, this was the army.</p>
      <p>MH: So there were some comrades who were ZIPRA but not ZAPU?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: Yes, quite a number of them. The young school boys coming from Manama Mission in 1978. Are they ZAPU? You have the Minister of Foreign Affairs now, SB Moyo. He came from Manama in 1978 as a young school boy. Could you call him ZAPU? He was a mere school child who joined the liberation struggle to fight the liberation struggle. He didn't join ZAPU. He joined ZIPRA because he came to fight. You have the former Minister Chiratidzo Mabuwa. She also came from Manama. Would you call her a politician?</p>
      <p>MH: Am happy you have mentioned former Minister Mabuwa. Where there female comrades in ZIPRA?</p>
      <p>Cde Conary: We had female comrades. They received training but they had not gone to the front when the war ended. We actually had a camp for the female trained comrades. Their commander was Gertrude Moyo. Former Minister Mabuwa was also there together with Cde Mhandu, she is a Colonel in the army now. These female commanders after receiving training continued to train other female comrades. In ZIPRA we would not allow female comrades to mix with male comrades. Female comrades stayed in their own camp away from their male counterparts. The leadership was afraid that if the two mixed, they would start producing children instead of focusing on the war.</p>
      <p>I remember Joshua Nkomo who always said 'what are we going to tell the parents of these girls when they go home with kids?' It was a big offense to be found in a camp for female comrades in ZIPRA.</p>

      <title>Focac should spur African cohesion</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Last week's Forum on China-Africa Co-operation in Beijing brings to the fore the need to fast-track the African Continental Free Trade Area.</p>
      <p>Not only that, the protocols on Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment must be ratified with speed in order for the continent to create for itself first, the environment that China is creating to further its own interests on the continent.</p>
      <p>For the One Belt, One Road Initiative to be a success, China needs an Africa with solid infrastructure and skilled workforce. It needs an economically strong Africa with per capita income that makes it a viable market for Chinese goods. It needs a conflict-free Africa with strict enforcement of laws that deal with corruption.</p>
      <p>In the past 18 years since Focac started, China has seen a deepening commitment from Africa. Which is why it has married its 'New Silk Road' plan with Africa's Agenda 2063, whose flagship programme is the AfCFTA.</p>
      <p>The Chinese do not see the borders that divide Africa into many small nations. They see a giant future economic hub with a rich, diverse culture, abundant natural and human resources, a 1,2 billion persons market for Chinese goods and services; but most importantly, a partner in the creation of a new world order.</p>
      <p>An order based on an all-inclusive vision for economic, political and security development.</p>
      <p>But other players that have tried to do business or enter into partnerships with Africa, particularly the European Union and the United States, have had one thing in common - selfish interests.</p>
      <p>They have not gotten over the master/servant hangover created in 1884-85 in Berlin, Germany.</p>
      <p>They still want to be domineering, inserting themselves into the African politics, interfering in sovereign nations' internal affairs, bullying through such instruments as sanctions and sometimes even outright violence.</p>
      <p>But as China's President Xi Jinping has repeatedly said, including at the recently ended summit, China will not get involved in African nations' internal affairs.</p>
      <p>This is proven by the Chinese's 5 000-year-old civilisation, which shows that at no point in its staggering, long and illustrious history has China tried to build its empire based on domination of others.</p>
      <p>Even in the late 1970s and early 1980s as China reorganised itself and was entering a period of tough economic turnaround, which led to growth and stability, it still helped African countries not only logistically but financially on equal footing.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely nothing to fear from the Chinese.</p>
      <p>However, Africans must take China's manoeuvres with the utmost respect that they deserve. China wants a competent partner and the worry is that lethargy, procrastination, corruption and a lot of other vices that afflict this great continent will make Africa an incompetent partner.</p>
      <p>It is largely believed, for instance, that Africa has missed most development goals, including some of its own targets, not because of lack of resources but because of corruption.</p>
      <p>Which is why there are more developing nations in the African Union than any other multilateral grouping in the world.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, China is strict on such things as corruption, and moves decisively and with speed in implementing its programmes.</p>
      <p>For instance, there are 54 Confucius Institutes in 41 African countries since the first one opened in Nairobi Kenya in 2006 and plans are afoot for more such institutions on the continent.</p>
      <p>Confucius Institutes are modelled on Western cultural institutes such as France's Institute Français, Germany's Goethe Institute or the UK's British Council.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, China already has a diplomatic mission to the African Union based at the continental body's headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>Yet, the African Union, made up of 54 nations, has failed to open a similar diplomatic mission in Beijing. Perhaps the Africans are waiting for Beijing to build it for them and hand it over as they have done before when they built the $200 million AU headquarters in Addis Ababa.</p>
      <p>So, while Focac has created a valuable platform for collective dialogue and cooperation between African nations through such programmes as AfCFTA under the umbrella of Agenda 2063, do African leaders themselves realise this and are they willing to walk the talk?</p>
      <p>Judging from the words of the African Union Commission Chair Moussa Faki at the African Union Extraordinary Summit held at the Kigali Convention Centre in Rwanda in March this year, it seems they do, but perhaps lack the will and thus need to be nudged.</p>
      <p>'The world is changing, and changing at a great speed. International competition is fierce. It leaves no room for the weak,' said Mr Faki.</p>
      <p>At that March extraordinary summit, 44 countries signed the agreement establishing the AfCFTA and 43 Heads of State signed the declaration for the launch of AfCFTA, while 27 signed protocols relating to Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment.</p>
      <p>The goal of AfCFTA is to create a single market followed by free movement and a single currency.</p>
      <p>What remains is the ratification of protocols and instruments that make AfCFTA functional.</p>
      <p>A number of countries have already deposited the ratification instruments, but AfCFTA will only formally exist once all documents are concluded and ratified by at least 22 countries.</p>
      <p>There is a challenge. Some of the bigger countries, like South Africa, said the ratification process might need more time and Nigeria, Africa's second-biggest economy, is one of the dozen countries which did not sign.</p>
      <p>When will African leaders realise that the continent needs unity in order to be a force to be reckoned with?</p>
      <p>Said Mr Faki: 'For Africa, after decades of independence, marked by persistent under-development and a marginal place in the international system, the terms of the debate are laid down in almost Manichean terms: Unite or Perish, as Kwame Nkrumah said at the Addis Ababa founding Summit.'</p>
      <p>He added: 'Economic integration thus responds not only to aspirations born out of Pan-Africanism, but also to a practical imperative linked to the economic viability of the continent.</p>
      <p>'Our peoples, our business community and our youth, in particular, cannot wait any longer to see the lifting of the barriers that divide our continent, hinder its economic take-off and perpetuate misery, even though Africa is abundantly endowed with wealth.'</p>
      <p>He further noted that, 'Outside the continent, our efforts are observed with a mixture of admiration and scepticism. This Summit must, therefore, mark a break. It must strengthen the confidence of our peoples in their union and its ability to fulfil their aspirations.</p>
      <p>It must confound those who, outside Africa, continue to think, with barely concealed condescension, that our decisions will never materialise.'</p>
      <p>By marrying President Xi's flagship Belt and Road Initiative to Africa's Agenda 2063, the world's second-largest economy has shown beyond any reasonable doubt that it does not view Africa's grand plans with 'condescension'.</p>
      <p>China's commitment must surely prove to Africa that integration is not an option, but an imperative.</p>
      <p>It is now incumbent upon the Africans themselves to move with speed in implementing Agenda 2063 and shun the vices that have long led to the stigmatisation of the continent and its leaders.</p>
      <p>President Xi himself warned that the money that China is pouring into Africa is not for 'luxuries'.</p>
      <p>To paraphrase Emperor Haile Selassie at the May 1963 Summit, the giant Africa cannot wake up if it remains divided.</p>
      <p>A united Africa, with a single passport - which means uniform visa requirements, a strong well-funded African Union Army, a single currency, diplomatic missions that represent Africa in different parts of the world, a functional Pan-African parliament etcetera - is likely to reap more.</p>
      <p>Collective bargaining will bring more.</p>

      <title>Planning for a good summer cropping season</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The forecast for the 2019/2020 summer cropping season is for a normal to below-normal rainfall season.</p>
      <p>Weather experts divide the season into three, three-month periods.</p>
      <p>For the first three months - October to December - the whole country is forecast to receive normal to above-normal rains.</p>
      <p>In the next three-month period (November to January), the country is again forecast to receive normal to above-normal rains.</p>
      <p>During the third period, which runs from December to February, the northern parts of the country - for example, the three Mashonaland provinces, Manicaland and Midlands - are expected to receive normal to above-normal rains, whilst a small belt in the southern region of Masvingo is projected to receive normal to below-normal rains.</p>
      <p>Also, in the January to March period, the whole country is forecast to have normal to below-normal rains.</p>
      <p>However, as explained above, the 'normal to below-normal' bit is only expected at the tail end of the season.</p>
      <p>Planting early</p>
      <p>Given the weather forecast, it is prudent for Government to ensure that farmers would be able to plant early.</p>
      <p>The major challenge farmers face today is the fact that they now require huge amounts of money to produce.</p>
      <p>It costs approximately US$900 to US$1 000 to grow a hectare of maize and at today's interbank exchange rates, this translates to approximately $15 000 per hectare.</p>
      <p>Similarly, this translates $300 000 for 20 hectares and a massive $750 000 for 50 hectares.</p>
      <p>However, bear in mind that input suppliers do not use the interbank rate to price their products; therefore, they are likely to be using the exchange rate way above the interbank rate, hence, the cost of growing a hectare will be at least $20 000, and a massive $1 million would be needed for just 50 hectares.</p>
      <p>There are very few farmers out there who can fork out that kind of money from their pockets/bank accounts.</p>
      <p>Government should, therefore, bail out farmers by making the finance available to them on a loan basis.</p>
      <p>A Government finance scheme like Command Agriculture has received a lot of criticism lately ostensibly because a lot of farmers were defaulting.</p>
      <p>Also, there were allegations of lack of transparency in the distribution of inputs.</p>
      <p>Government has, therefore, since engaged some banks to administer an agricultural financing scheme on its behalf.</p>
      <p>If farmers were to approach banks on their own, banks would do their normal due diligence and charge prevailing interest rates and demand collateral.</p>
      <p>These are obviously not affordable at the moment, hence the PPP (public-private partnership) arrangement among Government, banks and private input suppliers will see farmers being charged just 10 percent per annum on loans.</p>
      <p>Having said that, the only challenge we face is that the new financing arrangements were announced late and the agreed process is likely to take long, especially at a time the rainy season is imminent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is need for Government to sit down with farmer unions/ representatives, Agritex and banks, and agree on ways to shorten the process so that farmers can get inputs and plant early.</p>
      <p>We stand to benefit as a country if farmers were to plant early.</p>
      <p>Merit</p>
      <p>Whilst Government is emphasising the need to finance farmers with irrigation facilities, I feel this is a misplaced emphasis.</p>
      <p>Government should simply identify capable farmers who have a history of delivering to GMB and finance them.</p>
      <p>Agritex officials on the ground know the good farmers.</p>
      <p>With the current electricity challenges, irrigating crops is likely to have its challenges.</p>
      <p>Actually, some farmers who grew wheat this past winter season failed to irrigate their crops to maturity and some ended up just ploughing it under as green manure.</p>
      <p>Electricity was available for barely five hours, including on farms, yet that is not even sufficient to irrigate one portion if a farmer is using portable pipes.</p>
      <p>In a normal situation, a farmer moves the pipes three to four times a day, so five hours of electricity is not really beneficial to farmers.</p>
      <p>We are better off engaging capable farmers and timeously providing them with inputs.</p>
      <p>Also, we should always try to learn from history, and history tells us that the first year that Command Agriculture was launched, Government provided the 'good' farmers with inputs very early, and the country witnessed a bumper harvest.</p>
      <p>It is commendable that Government has taken the decision to continue funding the production of critical crops like maize and soya beans through a PPP arrangement with banks and the private sector.</p>
      <p>However, it should also ensure long-term sustainability by making sure that the inputs have been directed to the right farmers, the inputs are available on time, farmers plant on time and that the farmers receive adequate support to see the crops through to harvest.</p>
      <p>Co-operation</p>
      <p>Whilst the decision to channel funds through banks was a good idea, more could be achieved if Government worked with farmers' associations, Agritex and private sector input suppliers.</p>
      <p>How? Firstly, Government should provide enough support to Agritex, the extension arm of Government.</p>
      <p>Currently, agricultural extension officers/workers literally stay at their stations since they do not have the means to visit farmers.</p>
      <p>These officers should be able to regularly visit farmers and give advice on pests and disease control, weed management et cetera.</p>
      <p>They can also compliment banks in monitoring the performance of contracted farmers on the ground.</p>
      <p>I doubt that CBZ and Agribank will have enough manpower to monitor farmers on the ground; therefore, the extension officers could be useful, provided they have been given resources.</p>
      <p>Secondly, whilst at the time of assessment a farmer looks capable, breakdowns happen in farming, and once a tractor, for example, breaks down in the middle of land preparation or planting, it takes time for a farmer to fix the problem.</p>
      <p>This is more so in the current economic environment, where prices have sky-rocketed.</p>
      <p>Farmers normally receive support from other nearby farmers; therefore, it is best that Government, through the extension officers, encourages farmers to form farmers' associations.</p>
      <p>The reality on the ground sometimes is that two neighbouring farmers hardly know each other and cannot assist each other.</p>
      <p>The white former commercial farmers had very strong farmers' associations.</p>
      <p>The same should happen with our current ones.</p>
      <p>If they support each other, farming operations are likely to be done on time.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, input suppliers are normally very happy to provide training to farmers on the use of their products.</p>
      <p>We continue to get low yields because some farmers will have failed to properly control weeds or pests like armyworm.</p>
      <p>There are private companies out there who, given the opportunity, will provide free training to farmers on the use of herbicides, pesticides et cetera.</p>
      <p>Farmers have not yet grasped control measures on pests like the notorious fall armyworm.</p>
      <p>Worse still, Government has not provided the necessary funding to train extension officers so that they can adequately provide the same training to farmers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, as a short-term measure, Government should invite input suppliers it engaged in the PPP arrangement to come forward and provide free training to farmers on the use of their products.</p>
      <p>They just need to be invited to do so by Government agencies.</p>
      <p>Last season, the country harvested about 750 000 metric tonnes and now we have to import maize from countries like Tanzania.</p>
      <p>We are, therefore, starting from a deficit/negative position.</p>
      <p>What we need now is to have as many good farmers as possible to be provided with inputs so that they can plant early, so that we realise a sizeable maize crop as a nation and place hope on the weather forecast, which is predicting a normal- to below-normal season.</p>
      <p>It is also not enough for Government to say they have provided funding through banks.</p>
      <p>Measures should be put in place to expedite the provision of inputs to the contracted farmers so that they can plant early.</p>
      <p>Government should also provide support to its departments so that the officers not only provide agricultural extension support, but also assist in monitoring and organising training to farmers.</p>

      <title>ZANU PF SA district in solidarity march</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ZANU PF South Africa (SA) District will today hold an anti-sanctions march in Pretoria, as Zimbabweans living outside the country join the region in calling for the unconditional removal of the embargo.</p>
      <p>Other ZANU PF districts around the world are expected to similarly engage in various events in solidarity with the joint regional lobby.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Sunday Mail, ZANU PF SA District secretary for information and publicity, Cde Kennedy Mandaza, said the Diaspora has been a victim since sanctions make it difficult to process financial transactions to Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>'Some companies have been blocked from transacting with Zimbabwean financial institutions through money transfer platforms. ZANU PF SA joins the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Cde. E. D. Mnangagwa, the ZANU PF collective leadership, the leadership and people of the SADC region and the gallant people of Zimbabwe in unambiguously calling for the immediate and unconditional removal of the illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe. The Diaspora community has not been spared. Diaspora remittances have been intercepted and other money transfer companies have been victimised on specific transactions.'</p>
      <p>Cde Mandaza said the restrictions on financial transactions destined for Zimbabwe was scaring away potential investors.</p>
      <p>'Many people came here to South Africa because they lost jobs after many companies were closed due to the sanctions. These sanctions are a clear violation of the human rights of the people in Zimbabwe and the region. In fact, the sanctions are a subtle declaration of war on the countries affected.</p>
      <p>'The illegal economic sanctions, which were unilaterally imposed following the country's stance to redistribute land on a more equitable basis and correct the colonial imbalances in the ownership of the resource, have caused untold suffering on the ordinary citizens in and outside the country. The intention, packaged as targeted sanctions, is to suffocate the Zimbabwean economy so that Zimbabweans and the region can pander to the whims and caprices of the West. The West wants us to remain subservient to their evil machinations,' he said.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of Zimbabweans living in SA are expected to take part in today's solidarity march.</p>

      <title>Life without a single strand of hair</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>WHILE hair is the crowning glory for most women, something that makes them feel beautiful, a woman in Kaitano Village, Mudzi, has none whatsoever.</p>
      <p>Dorica Ngwenya, who lost every strand of hair on her body in her teens, is treated like a freak.</p>
      <p>She has been without hair for the past 15 years. Regarding her condition, squabbles within her family have hindered her prospects of ever getting medical or even traditional help.</p>
      <p>This has led many locals into speculating that the condition could be a side-effect of get-rich-quick black magic. Stranger than Fiction reached out to Ngwenya.</p>
      <p>'It all started some 15 years ago when I woke up one morning with a small portion of my hair missing,' she began her narration.</p>
      <p>Looking a bit strange with some of her hair missing, Ngwenya decided to shave it all off.</p>
      <p>But when it was time for the hair to grow back, she said it only grew on the sides.</p>
      <p>When she shaved off her hair again in an effort to have it all grow back, that was the last time she saw any hair on her body. It never grew back.</p>
      <p>'At first I would hide and those close to me thought I had gone through chemotherapy,' she said.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, hair loss is not something that can be hidden for long. Friends said attempts to help Ngwenya have been unsuccessful due to objections from some family members.</p>
      <p>However, Ngwenya's case is not an isolated one. In 2014, a Gokwe woman, Thokozani Mpofu, also spoke about how she went without any hair for nine years. She claimed that her hair was being used for rituals.</p>
      <p>Can hair be used for rituals?</p>
      <p>Does hair contain something special which makes it a target for ritualists? Is rapid hair loss a result of juju? If not, is there is a medical explanation for it?</p>
      <p>According to The Scientist Magazine, rapid hair loss is a medical condition called alopecia iniversalis. It includes loss of hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. Health specialists and online sources say it is the most severe form of alopecia areata, with an incidence of 0,0005 percent or one in 200 000 people.</p>
      <p>There is no standard treatment for people with this condition. Spontaneous re-growth is always a possibility, even for those with 100 percent hair loss over many years. However, it is not possible to predict when re-growth will occur. While cancer treatment in the form of chemotherapy is known to cause hair loss as a side-effect, doctors say a thinning mane may be a sign of certain types of cancer in the first place.</p>
      <p>Cases of mysterious hair loss</p>
      <p>Lauren Engle, a woman who lives in Dallas Texas, United States of America, lost every strand of her hair in a mysterious way. Her ponytail shrunk to the thickness of a pencil before it eventually fell off. Efforts to get medical attention were fruitless and she had to live with her baldness for years before her death. Millions of women in the United States of America suffer from hair loss, caused by genes, age or alopecia areata. In Engle's case, the culprit was unexplained female pattern baldness.</p>
      <p>Australia</p>
      <p>Life Science blog reports of unexplained hair loss in a four-year-old boy in Australia. The boy was born normal but later lost every strand of his hair mysteriously. His parents claim that it was the work of black magic. The child just woke up without hair and they could not find any traces of hair that had been cut. The child is still a bald head.</p>
      <p>Malawi</p>
      <p>In Malawi, a woman, Kondwani Nankhumwa, had her hair cut when she was asleep at a friend's house and it never grew back. She believes her hair could have been used by ritualists because every effort she made to make it grow back never worked.</p>

      <title>Black granite: meagre revenue from prized stone</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>An old and battered haulage truck navigates its way through a narrow pothole-ridden road, releasing plumes of smoke as it contends with the sheer weight of its load. In its wake, it leaves a cloud of dust, forcing pedestrians using the same road to cover their noses.</p>
      <p>Similarly antiquated trucks laden with granite are common in Mutoko, where for years they have been transporting the rock from surrounding mines.</p>
      <p>They signify rich pickings for the mining companies, but they are also a reminder of the systematic plunder of the resource here, to the detriment of development and the local environment.</p>
      <p>The stone is being exported to First World economies including Italy, Canada, the United States of America, Denmark and Australia.</p>
      <p>In spite of its mineral wealth, Zimbabwe is losing millions of dollars in potential revenue from the mining of black granite due to poor monitoring, inadequate infrastructure, lax taxation systems and non-existent value addition which, investigations have shown, may be contributing to trade mis-invoicing.</p>
      <p>According to the Centre for Natural Resource Governance, the absence of important infrastructure such as weigh bridges, compounded by colonial laws and poor monitoring systems, all which might be resulting in the under-reporting of the actual figures of granite extracted in the country.</p>
      <p>Trade mis-invoicing - a method of illicitly moving funds across borders by deliberately falsifying the value of goods - falls under the umbrella of the broader issue of illicit financial flows, whereby money leaves a country with companies, individuals or officials deliberately flouting regulations to make easy gains.</p>
      <p>In Zimbabwe, mis-invoicing is prejudicing Government of millions in potential tax revenue - a sum which could be benefiting the population instead of lining the pockets of companies.</p>
      <p>Several companies mine in Mutoko with multinational companies from Italy and China. The companies include Red Granite, Quarrying Enterprise, CRG and Zimbabwe International Quarrying and Natural Stones Export Company.</p>
      <p>Mr Farai Maguwu, the director of Zimbabwe's Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG), a civic organisation, says that in the black granite sector, companies are understating production figures in order to pay lower taxes. Officials at borders are also using the naked eye to estimate the weight of granite blocks, a practice that creates room for mis-invoicing and the doctoring of documentation.</p>
      <p>'A truck should be weighed at the mine and also at the border in order to compare if the figures tally,' says Maguwu.</p>
      <p>For 50 years, black granite has been mined primarily in the north-eastern parts of the country, in areas such as Uzumba-Maramba-Pfungwe, Murehwa and Mutoko.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe produced 223 356 tonnes of granite last year up from 161 123 tonnes in 2017, data from the Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines shows.</p>
      <p>Mutoko Rural District Council alone produces around 121 000 tonnes, with 10 083 tonnes produced monthly.</p>
      <p>Maguwu says the figures could be much higher, though verifying the figures might be difficult.</p>
      <p>Absence of weigh bridges</p>
      <p>According to Mutoko Rural District Council, the absence of Government mining officers at sites and the lack of basic infrastructure such as weigh bridges is contributing to mis-invoicing and the understating of production figures by some companies. As a result, local councils and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) rely on statistics provided by mining companies for taxation purposes.</p>
      <p>The chief executive officer of Mutoko Rural District Council, Mr Peter Sigauke, says verifying the authenticity of figures provided by the companies is near impossible.</p>
      <p>'We are getting quarterly production figures from the companies and we have no way of verifying if these figures are true,' he says.</p>
      <p>Sigauke says Government has failed to address the absence of weighbridges for 12 years now, which 'makes it very difficult to ascertain the figures we are being given by the companies'.</p>
      <p>'At one point between 2006 and 2007 we raised the issue of a weigh bridge to be erected near Mutoko District Council offices so that we would also be able to verify the figures,' he adds.</p>
      <p>Although a high-level committee was set up to oversee the development, and a tender was subsequently flighted, the weigh bridge was never erected.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwean law provides that local authorities receive a small fee for every tonne of granite extracted from their jurisdiction. Mutoko RDC gets $1 for every tonne of granite, but the computation of the exact tax figures is complicated by the absence of weigh bridges.</p>
      <p>Minerals Marketing Cooperation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ) chief executive officer, Mr Tongai Muzenda, says they are now working on building weigh bridges to rectify the issue.</p>
      <p>'We are doing this as a corrective measure since there is a possibility of figures being doctored due to the absence of these weigh bridges,' he says</p>
      <p>A 2017 investigation by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Indigenisation and Empowerment noted the lack of transparency around production figures in Mutoko and Mudzi districts due to the absence of infrastructure. It ordered the Mines Ministry to immediately facilitate the setting up of weighbridges in all mining areas.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson of the Dimension Stone Producers' Association, which represents nine granite mining companies in Mutoko, Mr Edward Muvuro says companies are not responsible for exporting the granite.</p>
      <p>'The stones are measured by length, weight and height and automatically you have the weight,' he says.</p>
      <p>'The blocks cannot go out until the MMCZ comes physically to the site to inspect the block and re-measure it. We are not authorised to do exports as exports are done by the MMCZ, who then raise an invoice for us. It is impossible to falsify the weight of the block,' he adds.</p>
      <p>A receipt seen by this publication shows that 12 blocks of raw granite costs $30 000, a figure which granite processers refute and say the figure is too low and claim a raw block fetches millions.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) which is responsible for collecting revenue from the sales of the granite did not respond to questions sent to them.</p>
      <p>Colonial-era laws</p>
      <p>In addition to the lack of weigh bridges, the continued export of unprocessed granite is bleeding the country of potential revenue.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a visit to a local granite processing factory - one of the few in the country - President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Government will introduce regulations banning exports of raw blocks.</p>
      <p>During the visit he said a block of unpolished granite fetches less compared to a similar weight that has been cut and polished. Thus, he said a blanket ban on the export of raw granite is imminent.</p>
      <p>He also promised the introduction of robust monitoring systems to stem illicit leaks.</p>
      <p>Mutoko Rural District Council's Sigauke believes the proposed ban will stimulate local development and job creation.</p>
      <p>'The cutting and polishing should be done in Mutoko, this is the only way there can be development in this area,' he says.</p>
      <p>Muguwu, of the CNRG, however, opines that the problem lies much deeper.</p>
      <p>He says tax rules and mining laws in effect since colonial days need to be overhauled to address the challenges besetting the sub sector.</p>
      <p>'We have the Mines and Minerals Act, which was enacted in 1961 by the Rhodesian colonial government, the law was not to empower the indigenous people but to empower the minority,' he says. 'There is a need to reform it to make sure it stops some of the loopholes that were causing leakages.'</p>
      <p>Environmental impact</p>
      <p>Back in Mutoko, the once pristine ecosystem has been ravaged, parts of the district have turned into wasteland, characterised by parched landscapes and poisoned rivers. Houses and public infrastructure have been scarred by blasting. People and livestock have drowned in gaping open mining pits, with little in terms of compensation coming their way.</p>
      <p>Most companies use the open-cast mining technique, which leaves large pits in the ground.</p>
      <p>The 2017 Parliamentary report notes the massive environmental impact caused by the mining.</p>
      <p>'Environmental degradation comes as a result of quarrying, dumping of the large black granite boulders everywhere, pollution and unsustainable clearing of vegetation to pave way for quarry extraction and, to construct roads resulting in serious deforestation,' reads the report in part. 'The use of heavy machinery, such as graders, front-end loaders, and heavy trucks, contribute to the rapid deterioration of roads,' it adds.</p>
      <p>And in spite of its mineral endowments, Mutoko remains underdeveloped.</p>
      <p>Mining companies are accused of neglecting the development of the communities they work in. Local villagers are unhappy. They say the companies' social corporate responsibility activities are negligible.</p>
      <p>'The local ecological debt and underdevelopment does not match with the area's natural resources endowment,' Faith Chikowore of Mbudzi village says.</p>
      <p>Previously, Government tried to force mining companies to develop the areas through the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, which compelled mining companies to cede part ownership of their enterprises to local communities through trusts. They were also required to provide seed capital to a local trust for community development projects.</p>
      <p>But the law has since been repealed.</p>
      <p>Mr Muvuro says the companies conduct their activities in an environmentally responsible manner.</p>
      <p>'After we have mined we plant trees, grass and add soil at every area that we would have mined. But there are instances where villagers request us not to close pools which they say would benefit their livestock given that there are not many water sources in the area.</p>
      <p>'The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) said we should close these pools but communities say their livestock benefit from these pools. We have since asked the communities to write to EMA and explain their predicament, which they have since done.'</p>
      <p>In 2016, Government summoned some of the companies operating in Mutoko to explain why they were not contributing to local development. They simply cited the harsh economic conditions as unfavourable to such endeavours.</p>
      <p>Mr Muvuro contends that the companies are contributing to development through building and modernising local schools.</p>
      <p>He said: 'At every school, from primary to secondary up to university level, we have students that we are paying school fees for. We do not limit this to Mutoko, we have operations in Murehwa, we have operations in Uzumba.'</p>

      <title>Cassava unveils Sasai TeamTalk with free calls on Sundays</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Cassava Fintech International (CFI), a subsidiary of Econet Global, today realesed an enhanced voice and video coferencing service that allows up to 20 people on one call.</p>
      <p>The service, branded Sasai TeamTalk, was unveiled as a promotional offer of Free Sasai Conference calling, between 8am and 5pm every Sunday until the end of the month.</p>
      <p>The service is available through the Sasai all-in-one super App that allows users to pay, chat, and explore a vast range of services, content and much more, and has been unveiled in Zimbabwe first.</p>
      <p>Sasai TeamTalk will offer free voice and video conference service, with secure end-to-end encryption, that connects up to 20 people on a single call, compared to telcos and most other social media platforms that offer between five and eight people on a conference call.</p>
      <p>Announcing the introduction of the Sasai TeamTalk Free promotional offer, Mr Eddie Chibi, the CEO of Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe said the timing of this service could not have been more appropriate.</p>
      <p>'Families, communities, industries and nations have been impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, working from home and social distancing have been introduced as some of the measures to stem the spread of the virus and flattern the curve, said Chibi.</p>
      <p>'However, for business, lockdown should not mean 'shutdown' and team meetings must still happen if productivity is to be maintained.</p>
      <p>'For families, friends or churches, social distancing should not mean that they stop 'seeing' each other, talking to each other or having fellowship in cell groups because they can now use Sasai TeamTalk.'</p>
      <p>He added that the latest feature on the Sasai super App already offers a unique in-app language translator service with over 80 languages, 50 of which are African languages, including Shona and Ndebele.</p>
      <p>The Sasai super App was first launched in August 2019 and is already being used in 180 countries across the globe.</p>
      <p>Following its launch in Zimbabwe, Sasai TeamTalk will be rolled out to other markets.</p>
      <p>The development of Sasai TeamTalk, offering one of the largest meeting room any social media platform can offer, was inspired by the need to achieve business continuity and to close the distance created between families and close social groups such as churches by social distancing.</p>
      <p>'We fast-tracked this product to meet a market need to enable families, churches and communities across the country to spend time together online during this time in which they are not able to meet freely due to social distancing restrictions on movement.'</p>
      <p>He added that as part of the promotion, Sasai data costs at any other time would be at half of the Whatsapp data costs until May 31 as a way to bring some relief to Zimbabweans.</p>
      <p>The Sasai super App, which can take up to 250 people in a chat group, already brings families closer by allowing international remittances from the United Kingdom, European Union and South Africa to Zimbabwe and over 30 countries across the world, at the lowest fees available.</p>
      <p>During the Covid-19 epidemic, businesses are expected to use their resources and expertise to help combat the global pandemic.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the surge in employees, students, teachers and other professionals working from home has resulted in a sharp demand for digital telecommuting tools such as voice and video conferencing, online collaboration and chat systems.</p>
      <p>Sasai Team Talk will allow multiple users to collaborate and chat virtually from anywhere in the world while staying informed and up to speed with the latest news and information on Sasai's Explore feature.</p>
      <p>To access and instantly use Sasai TeamTalk, one must download the Sasai App on the Google Play store or the Apple App Store, start a chat and simply click on the voice or video camera icon. Users of Sasai TeamTalk can, among other things, swap between the front and rear-facing camera, mute the call and, of course, end the call when they are done, by tapping the red phone button.</p>
      <p>Sasai Chief Operating Officer, Mr Tapera Mushoriwa added, 'The Sasai TeamTalk feature was developed to address a critical need in the market. It sits in the all-in-one super App to provide users with efficient data usage compared to the use of separate, multiple apps.'</p>
      <p>Mr Mushoriwa said Sasai would be adding more features to TeamTalk in the coming weeks.</p>

      <title>'Support breastfeeding for a healthier planet'</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>EVERY year, more than 120 countries celebrate the World Breastfeeding Week (WBW) from August 1 to August 7, which promotes exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life.</p>
      <p>Critically, exclusive breastfeeding basically provides vital nutrients to babies.</p>
      <p>And it protects infants from deadly diseases such as pneumonia and diarrhoea.</p>
      <p>Breast milk primarily fosters growth and development of a child in the first six months of life.</p>
      <p>Equally, breastfeeding is particularly effective against infectious diseases.</p>
      <p>It directly strengthens the child's immune system by transferring antibodies from the mother.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the transmission of coronavirus through breast milk has not yet been scientifically proven.</p>
      <p>Initially, breasts produce the 'ideal milk' - colostrum.</p>
      <p>Colostrum is a breast fluid produced by humans, cows and other mammals before breast milk is released.</p>
      <p>Biologically, colostrum is critical in the development of the child's digestive system. Colostrum is very nutritious and contains high levels of antibodies.</p>
      <p>Naturally, breasts responsively produce more milk as the baby's nutritional requirements increase. But with formula supplements, breasts usually produce less milk.</p>
      <p>Since 1992, the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action has been increasingly promoting a global breastfeeding culture.</p>
      <p>As such, it has been providing support for breastfeeding everywhere.</p>
      <p>WBW is a commemoration of the Innocenti Declaration, which was adopted by WHO and UNICEF in August 1990.</p>
      <p>The goal was to extensively protect and support breastfeeding.</p>
      <p>Breast milk contains vital antibodies that help the baby to fight off viruses and bacteria. And it has a nearly perfect mix of vitamins, protein, and fat - everything the baby needs.</p>
      <p>In some studies, breastfeeding has been potentially linked to higher IQ scores in later childhood.</p>
      <p>More so, the physical closeness, skin-to-skin touching and eye contact are equally important for improved mother-to-child bonding.</p>
      <p>In the face of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, Covid-19 positive breastfeeding mothers must extremely practise recommended health precautions.</p>
      <p>In fact, children who are exclusively breastfed have reportedly fewer ear infections, respiratory illnesses, and bouts of diarrhoea.</p>
      <p>At least, babies must be exclusively breastfed for a year.</p>
      <p>Other foods such as vegetables, grains, fruits and proteins should be routinely introduced at six months of age.</p>
      <p>According to research, breastfed children are more likely to gain the right amount of weight as they grow old.</p>
      <p>It is highly thought that breast milk clinically lowers the risk of diabetes, obesity and certain cancers.</p>
      <p>But more research ought to be done to scientifically inform on such a phenomenon.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, breast feeding significantly lowers the child's risk of developing asthma, or allergies.</p>
      <p>The American Academy of Paediatrics claims that 'breastfeeding plays a role in the prevention of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)'.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, breastfed children have fewer hospitalisations and outpatient visits.</p>
      <p>Mothers, too, can patently benefit from breastfeeding.</p>
      <p>Breastfeeding naturally burns extra calories, helping mothers to speedily lose pregnancy- induced weight.</p>
      <p>Physiologically, breastfeeding releases the hormone oxytocin. Oxytocin release essentially promotes the uterus to quickly return to its pre-pregnancy size, reducing risks of post-partum haemorrhage.</p>
      <p>More importantly, breastfeeding lowers the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The risk of developing osteoporosis can be significantly lowered, too.</p>
      <p>Economically, breastfeeding saves money and time. And regularly offers mothers time to relax quietly with the newly born, creating a very important bond between the mother and child.</p>
      <p>As the World celebrates the World Breastfeeding Week, let us all 'support breastfeeding for a healthier planet'.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, mothers should appreciate the ABCs of breastfeeding. ABC entails awareness of the signs of hunger, being patient to breastfeed, and comfort during breastfeeding.</p>

      <title>Zimbabwe lose in Coca-Cola Africa final</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE Zimbabwe's Under-16 football team's impressive run at the Copa Coca-Cola Africa Cup came to screeching halt when they suffered a 6-2 defeat at the hands of Tanzania at Thika stadium.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe booked a place in the finals stage after beating hosts and defending champions Kenya by 3-1 in the opening match of Group A on Monday, before booking a place in the quarter finals when they prevailed 4-2 over Mozambique on the same day.</p>
      <p>Having finished as Group A log leaders, the Zimbabwe team booked a quarter final berth with Namibia whom they beat 4-1 to set up the Battle of the Zambezi with Zambia in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>The two Southern Africa neighbors played to a two all-draw in regulation time setting a stage for the grueling penalty shoot-out.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe goal-minder Ronald Uraya then emerged the hero of the Battle of Zambezi after he leveled scores for Zimbabwe two minutes before time from the spot-kick and went on to save two penalties in the dreaded penalty shoot-out to ensure that Zimbabwe played in the final against Tanzania.</p>
      <p>Their dream of securing the Coca-Cola Africa Cup trophy were then dashed as Tanzania were crowned The Coca-Cola Africa Cup Champions.</p>
      <p>Enesio Perezo had put Zimbabwe upfront early into the match, before the East African side began to run riot, scoring five goals in the first half.</p>
      <p>The resumption of the second half saw Zimbabwe pull one back, from the spot, through Uraya before hopes for comeback were dented a few minutes later as Tanzania scored their sixth goal of the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Despite the loss Zimbabwe had something to smile about as Luke Musikiri - who was in splendid form throughout tournament, and found the back of the net on six occasions - was named Player of the Tournament.</p>
      <p>Last year Zimbabwe was knocked-out of the tournament in the group stages.</p>

      <title>True grit beneath the beauty</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>When we go down the annals of this country's history, specifically the 2018 harmonised elections, Justice Priscilla Chigumba will feature prominently.</p>
      <p>She was at the centre of it all and she held herself very well.</p>
      <p>Before taking over one of the toughest jobs in the highly politicised country called Zimbabwe, Justice Chigumba had already made her mark as a judge of the High Court.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the High Court judge became a darling of activists, human rights defenders and the opposition political parties after delivering a brave judgement in which she overturned a Government ban against demonstrations in Harare.</p>
      <p>A year later, the valiant woman again came under the spotlight when she ruled that there was no evidence to convict #ThisFlag founder, Pastor Evan Mawarire, on allegations of attempting to overthrow Mr Robert Mugabe's Government.</p>
      <p>With such an impressive and indelible footprint, it is almost difficult to believe that Justice Chigumba was sworn in as a magistrate just 13 short years ago and made it to the High Court bench in 2012.</p>
      <p>Then the young woman found herself at the very centre of Zimbabwe's historic elections and it didn't seem to unnerve her.</p>
      <p>With 23 Presidential aspirants and 133 contesting parties, she had her work cut out - especially with an opposition MDC-Alliance determined to dispute every single move she made.</p>
      <p>The MDC-Alliance called her a prostitute, they accused her of being biased, and they tried to make Zec only what they opposition wanted.</p>
      <p>She did not flinch.</p>
      <p>She firmly told the world that only an earthquake could stop the elections after the proclamation of the date by the President.</p>
      <p>'As I have already said, not even the Government of Zimbabwe can direct or control Zec to do anything or not do anything,' said Justice Chigumba, who - like a diamond - got harder as the heat and pressure increased.</p>
      <p>There was no earthquake, and Justice Chigumba oversaw the elections in an unwavering, calm, confident and professional manner.</p>
      <p>When some quarters claimed she was delaying the announcement of the Presidential results, Justice Chigumba reminded Zimbabweans that Zec was well within constitutional timelines. Zec had five days to give the results. It did it in just about three.</p>
      <p>Professionalism and steadfastness are not the only words that capture the essence of Justice Chigumba; her sense of fashion is also on point.</p>
      <p>Considering her tight schedule, it was amazing how she always made sure she came before the world's cameras showcasing the best of Zimbabweans beauty.</p>
      <p>On a lighter (but very important) note, however, it is my opinion that the only thing that was a total mess during the just-ended polls was the fact that the women of Zimbabwe were notified rather late that their manicure would not be allowed on their pinkie fingers to pave way for the indelible ink.</p>
      <p>Imagine, the fairer sex had to sacrifice their expensive nails to cast their votes. If only they had been told earlier.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the naked pinkie nails that we have been seeing of late have been an eyesore. Maybe the new President can consider taking the women for a manicure. Just saying.</p>

      <title>UZ embarks on an industrial park</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The University of Zimbabwe (UZ) has embarked on an ambitious multi-million-dollar project that will see a massive transformation of part of its farm land into an industrial park in a construction venture meant to align the higher learning institution with international trends.</p>
      <p>The industrial park is envisaged to generate revenue for the university.</p>
      <p>UZ acting Vice Chancellor, Professor Paul Mapfumo told The Sunday Mail that the venture would afford students an opportunity for practical experience.</p>
      <p>'We have seen the need to convert part of the university farm land into an industrial park that will expose students to be more industrious and practical,' he said.</p>
      <p>'Our students have to enjoy the exposure and not be limited when they go for industrial attachment. We should engage them the moment they arrive at the institute.'</p>
      <p>The university runs a 1 800 hectare farm in Mazowe.</p>
      <p>Prof Mapfumo added that the industrial park venture feeds into a broader infrastructure development programme that is being pursued by the institution.</p>
      <p>'Other infrastructure projects that are on-going include a six storey building, technical education centre and a university inn, which are all funded internally as well as the innovation hub that is funded by the Government.</p>
      <p>'The innovation hub is 90 percent complete and we are now working on the fittings. There is a bit of a delay because of the new procurement regulations that we have to follow, but by end of June, it should be complete.'</p>
      <p>Professor Mapfumo said the university appreciates Government's efforts to promote its infrastructure development.</p>
      <p>He said this will ensure the realisation of the 5.0 education system which includes teaching, research, community engagement, innovation and industrialisation, in order to fill the skills gap.</p>

      <title>Vets Bill needs to expand in scope</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A SHOCKING incident took place in Harare sometime in February 2016, signifying a kick in the teeth on our moral fabric as Zimbabweans.</p>
      <p>This was during a time of significant upheaval in Zanu PF.</p>
      <p>Veterans of the Second Chimurenga under the auspices of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) had gathered near City Sports Centre for a national indaba to discuss their welfare and the goings-on in the ruling party.</p>
      <p>Police moved in to block the indaba, which initially was set to be held at Zanu PF Headquarters but was shifted after some party officials stopped them from entering the party premises.</p>
      <p>What followed was a ghastly scene of confrontation between the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and the war veterans.</p>
      <p>Police soon deployed water tankers and all manner of crowd dispersal techniques, including tear smoke and batons to chase the war veterans.</p>
      <p>Scores were injured in the ensuing melee, in scenes that some described as reminiscent of the running battles between the colonial police force and agitators for freedom.</p>
      <p>Zimbabweans were left in a deep state of shock upon witnessing the State turning its guns on founders of the nation.</p>
      <p>This incident served to perpetuate the notion of State-led neglect, mistreatment and disregard for the veterans of the Second Chimurenga.</p>
      <p>In one fell swoop, the State had transgressed against sections 3(1) (i), 3(2) (i) (iv), 23 and 84 of the Constitution which provide for respect and the rights of all veterans of the liberations struggle.</p>
      <p>Addressing a Press conference in the aftermath of the incident, ZNLWVA chair Ambassador Chris Mutsvangwa had no kind words for the State.</p>
      <p>'I am addressing you with a heavy heart, which stems from events of this morning that the ZRP found itself resorting to heavy-handed violence against selected representatives of our association,' said Amb Mutsvangwa.</p>
      <p>'This is a monstrosity . . . to see war vets being beaten by the police. We want an audience with our patron so that we understand where the compasses have gone wrong in the organs of the party but there are rights that also have been transgressed.'</p>
      <p>Enter the New Dispensation</p>
      <p>Fast forward to May 2018, the war veterans were back at the City Sports Centre - the same scene of the grim episode two years prior.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa had convened a national meeting with war veterans, to interface on their challenges. Acknowledging the war veterans' historic and well-documented grievances, the President undertook to take them head-on.</p>
      <p>'Government has already made a decision to increase allowances and pensions for all veterans to cushion you to your daily needs. My Government will support you in all your endeavours,' he said.</p>
      <p>It was not long before the Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Bill was gazetted.</p>
      <p>'The old dispensation failed to address your concerns, hence the new dispensation under the leadership of President Mnangagwa is working tirelessly to improve the livelihoods of the veterans,' said Defence and War Veterans Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri at an interactive meeting with the war veterans provincial leadership, in unveiling the Bill earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Bill passed the second reading stage in the National Assembly last week.</p>
      <p>It elicited animated debate over the welfare of war veterans from Parliamentarians across the political divide, albeit in the spirit of safeguarding the institution of war veterans.</p>
      <p>What was clear from the debate is that in its current form, the Bill may need to be expanded in scope to cover other areas of prodigious importance.</p>
      <p>Among other provisions, the Bill in its current form provides for the establishment of a Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Board whose role includes addressing issues relating to rights, benefits and</p>
      <p>the general welfare of veterans of the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>It provides for the creation of a vetting section in the Defence Ministry and the requisite vetting procedure.</p>
      <p>Crucially, the Bill explicitly provides for entitlements such as pensions, basic health care, education support and funeral assistance among other benefits for veterans of the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>War veterans, once the law is passed, will be entitled to at least 20 percent of all land gazetted for appropriation by the State.</p>
      <p>A Veterans of the Liberation Struggle Fund to provide for loans and grants will also be established.</p>
      <p>These provisions illustrate how much thought and wide consultations were deployed into the drafting of the Bill, seeing that it addresses, comprehensively, much of the principal welfare grievances.</p>
      <p>However, the Bill does very little in providing for the preservation of the institution of war veterans, for posterity.</p>
      <p>It focuses largely on providing for the welfare of war veterans, which, admittedly, is a consequence of the tough economic environment.</p>
      <p>Not much thought went into the fulfilment of Section 23 of the Constitution which provides for 'State-led according of due respect, honour and recognition to veterans of the liberation struggle'.</p>
      <p>Giving respect, honour and recognition surely goes beyond just providing for basic welfare needs of war vets.</p>
      <p>Recognition and honour must include preservation of their honour through State-led actions such as documentation of the exploits of these brave women and men.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, documentation of individual stories of our heroes has been negligible, 40 years after independence. In most cases, the stories we read are products of the vanquished.</p>
      <p>To illustrate the importance of documenting and preserving war efforts, most jurisdictions have set up war memorials and museums. Why is the Bill silent on such a noble undertaking?</p>
      <p>Contributing to the Bill's second reading debate last week, Concilia Chinanzvavana (proportional representation), was forthright about the importance of preserving history.</p>
      <p>'If we may at least have recognition for them. Maybe a roll of honour or a war veterans museum where we will have all the names of those on the roll of honour for those who went to war just listed,' she said.</p>
      <p>Other legislators also called for medals just like the ones chiefs have.</p>
      <p>It is common cause that some veterans of the liberation war suffer from ailments that include PTSD owing to their exposure to war while they were very young. Is it not prudent that the Bill also speaks to the need for mental rehabilitation and treatment for those in need?</p>
      <p>In other countries, war veterans are entitled to tax breaks, life insurance and home loans.</p>
      <p>The Bill needs to comprehensively provide for the welfare of our heroes and also the preservation of their memory.</p>

      <title>Treasury in Xmas pledge…$180m monthly for roller meal subsidy…Lines of credit secured for fuel</title>

      <p>Ishemunyoro Chingwere</p>
      <p>Business Reporter</p>
      <p>Government has put in place measures to ensure the festive season cheers will not be dampened by shortage of essential goods including fuel that have previously dogged the economy, says Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube.</p>
      <p>The minister on Friday said his ministry had particularly targeted fuel and food, which he said were critical for the festive season and going forward.</p>
      <p>There were fears that the Christmas cheer could be extinguished by shortages of food, beverages and fuel and as of Friday and Saturday many motorists were jostling for petrol or diesel</p>
      <p>However, in an interview with The Sunday Mail Business, Minister Ncube said Government was alive to the needs of the people and measures had been put in place to ensure that they were cushioned.</p>
      <p>Without giving exact figures of how much had been secured, the minister said Government had obtained lines of credit for the purchase of fuel to take the country through the festive season and beyond.</p>
      <p>He said queues that remained a feature at most service stations could be a function of consumers' penchant for topping up in anticipation of shortages.</p>
      <p>'We are doing everything we can to make sure that there is more fuel. You know we import the product so we will be allocating as much foreign currency as we can through the lines of credit,' said Minister Ncube.</p>
      <p>'Of course, the queues are long but you know what is happening with the queues as well. Everyone gets afraid and then they queue even if they don't have to, to make sure that their three or two cars have fuel so there is a sharp increase in demand for fuel.</p>
      <p>'But we are doing everything we can to make sure that this is dealt with. If you look at the issues around food, again we have put in lines of credit or borrowings to make sure that we have enough supplies going forward.</p>
      <p>'So we are alive to this and we are doing everything as Government to make sure that basic commodities are available at the right prices,' he said.</p>
      <p>Minister Ncube said Government was confident 2020 was going to be a much better year for the citizenry following the end of austerity measures, which saw Treasury managing to arrest the budget deficit.</p>
      <p>The minister hoped Zimbabwe would have a good rainy season and with inputs from the Presidential Input Support Scheme having been distributed, the country will have a better yield compared to the 2018/2019 farming season.</p>
      <p>Consumer basket</p>
      <p>'We have said that austerity is over in terms of the policies we were implementing to deal with fiscal adjustments. We have done quite a bit,' said the minister.</p>
      <p>'Our budget deficit is now under control. Government finances are sound. We now have the strength to finance growth and productivity and the 2020 Budget is focusing on that, so gradually, there is going to be an improvement.</p>
      <p>'We are all praying for a good rainy season, that's very important, we know farmers have started plantng . . . also pleased that the inputs for the Presidential inputs programme have been disbursed on time,' he said.</p>
      <p>On the roller meal subsidy, Minister Ncube said Government was targeting to spend $180 million per month and that there were plans to include other essential commodities in the subsidiesbasket.</p>
      <p>He, however, said that the subsidies will not be a permanent feature of the economy, but will be reviewed as and when necessary.</p>
      <p>According to the Consumer Council of Zimbabwe (CCZ), some of the commodities in the consumer basket are mealie meal, cooking oil, bread, detergents, margarine, meat, clothing and entals.</p>

      <title>'We have to kill the black market'</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>PRESIDENT Mnangagwa met members of the business community in April this year and expressed his displeasure over the unwarranted price increases of basic goods and services.</p>
      <p>He rightfully appealed to them to have a conscience and consider the plight of the average person in Zimbabwe. We were excited when the response from the business community was that of a price moratorium.</p>
      <p>However, it was partially implemented.</p>
      <p>The average person continues to bear the brunt of these price increases and what we have seen in the last two weeks is shocking.</p>
      <p>The President being conscious of the impact of price controls warned businesses that they should not force him to roll out legislative interventions.</p>
      <p>The business community is a major player in the economic matrix of any nation.</p>
      <p>Yes, business has to survive and has to be viable but there must be an economic justification for price increases.</p>
      <p>Price increases have a ripple effect on inflation and this is currently our major challenge.</p>
      <p>The issue of a manageable and reasonable exchange rate is key, and monetary authorities must endeavour to have robust and practical modalities of managing black market rates.</p>
      <p>We have gone through various foreign currency management systems in the last five years but these have not achieved the desired results.</p>
      <p>Some players continue to be in the playground of speculative tactics, manipulation and financial indiscipline - all of which have significantly contributed to the current economic discourse.</p>
      <p>Government has remained open to dialogue and suggestions but all players must be honest and committed to ethical business principles. We must not be what the President last week described as 'elite opportunists and malcontents'.</p>
      <p>Political rhetoric put aside, let us take an economic self-introspection and get out of the abyss of economic opportunism.</p>
      <p>It is only the ordinary person who will suffer. As Zimbabweans we have to do the correct and empirically acceptable economic behaviour - we have to kill the black market.</p>
      <p>We have to focus on productivity as opposed to speculative behaviour and we must take pride in our national currency and preserve it.</p>
      <p>We have the intellectual and human resource capacities.</p>
      <p>Together we can put a stop to the current price increases which are inflationary in nature and are affecting the purchasing power of the worker and average lifestyle of our citizens.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is a country whose economic activities have been hit left, right and centre by undesirable issues such as corruption, economic blockades and sanctions, and natural calamities such as droughts, cyclones etcetera but we need to move on for the sake of the generality of our people.</p>
      <p>People need to earn a living and Zimbabweans are hard workers whose efforts are being undermined by the aforementioned issues.</p>
      <p>However, I have no kind words for those fuelling the current price increase madness which inevitably results in hyperinflation as a vicious cost recovery cycle is created.</p>
      <p>This also causes the serious erosion of the purchasing power of the local currency, perpetuation of a nefarious foreign currency exchange rate, an undesirable Consumer Price Index and an inevitable demand for a continuous adjustment of wages and salaries.</p>
      <p>Business, labour and Government must sit, as a matter of urgency, using the platform of the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF).</p>
      <p>There is now a need for a social contract whose terms and conditions must be binding on all parties.</p>
      <p>Convening TNF meetings to discuss minimum wages will not address the root of the current challenges as I can assure you that within a short period parties will be forced to negotiate again.</p>
      <p>We already have the legislative framework in the form of the Tripartite Negotiating Forum Act and parties can agree to price freezes on selected goods and services for specified periods.</p>
      <p>I would recommend a situation where the agreed freeze would be legislated together with penalties or deterrent mandatory sentences for violators.</p>
      <p>This will work better than a gentleman price moratorium.</p>
      <p>Obviously, implementation of such a system needs strict monitoring which includes inspections by relevant arms of Government and local authorities.</p>
      <p>From an economic perspective, immediate reactions will be shortages of some commodities on the formal market, underhand dealings, resurgence of the black market etcetera, but I believe these can be managed.</p>
      <p>In any case these will be the labour pains before the child is born.</p>
      <p>My assumption is that a commitment by all social partners and improved market information systems will be necessary to make these interventions a success.</p>
      <p>The next key issue is productivity in order to ensure availability of goods and services.</p>
      <p>Investment interventions in key sectors such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing and tourism will improve competitiveness of domestic production and availability of goods and services at affordable prices.</p>
      <p>Insufficient growth in production will lead to higher and more volatile prices. Incentives in the form of tax concessions and subsidies can be rolled out to specific players who will have achieved set targets.</p>
      <p>This has been successfully done in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>We have heard the clarion call for increased productivity in both monetary and fiscal policy pronouncements in this country, unfortunately what we have lacked are specific interventions to make this a reality.</p>
      <p>Productivity reduces in the long run, demand pushes inflation, which normally occurs when aggregate demand is growing far much more than supply.</p>
      <p>For now in Zimbabwe we are experiencing cost-push inflation where firms respond to rising costs by increasing prices in order to protect their profit margins.</p>
      <p>Rising costs are mainly due to cost of raw materials, labour and foreign exchange costs. Experience has shown that improved productivity and efficiency can help to reduce these costs.</p>
      <p>We cannot ignore the issue of an unsustainable exchange rate especially on imported goods.</p>
      <p>A high exchange rate will mean the price you pay for imports will be high and logically the cost is passed to the consumer.</p>
      <p>We somehow have turned a blind eye to black market exchange rates and have appreciated an official exchange rate which regrettably has not been fully functional.</p>
      <p>I am of a considered opinion that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe must extensively do research on this topic and then come up with a realistic and manageable exchange rate system.</p>
      <p>Difficult yes, but possible!</p>

      <title>Four decades of history through Fr Ribeiro's eyes</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE presence of the late Jamaican reggae icon Bob Marley, Lord Soames (the last Governor of Rhodesia) and Britain's Prince Charles at Zimbabwe's April 18 1980 inaugural independence celebrations was largely a footnote of history for Roman Catholic priest Fr Emmanuel Ribeiro.</p>
      <p>The devout Catholic last week gave an account of what he personally expected on the big day at Rufaro Stadium in Harare.</p>
      <p>'The Prince (Charles) was here to surrender back the country. Bob Marley and other top bands were around for the celebrations, but all that did not matter,' recounted Fr Ribeiro.</p>
      <p>'I only eagerly awaited the moment Lord Soames pulled down the Union Jack and hoisted our Zimbabwe flag.'</p>
      <p>Soames was Britain's last colonial Governor in Rhodesia. He was one of the people the presided over Zimbabwe's transition to majority rule.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Charles, Prince of Wales, is the heir apparent to the British throne as the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II. He gave a farewell salute to Rhodesia on behalf of the royal family and the former colonisers, Britain.</p>
      <p>The sheer weight of emotions on this historical moment, he recalls, was indescribable.</p>
      <p>Although he remained reticent, the dancing, whistling and ululation from the ecstatic crowd really moved him.</p>
      <p>The hoisting of the flag was particularly surreal for the respected clergyman.</p>
      <p>'The day marked a moment of transformation and realisation as the country entered a new era. As the Zimbabwean flag was hoisted, it felt like eternity. I felt like I was seeing the colours for the first time. It was unbelievable that the moment had finally come,' added Fr Ribeiro, who was one of the officials at the epochal event.</p>
      <p>He is among the few Zimbabweans who have first-hand experience of the brutal nature of the Rhodesian government, which was led by the late Ian Smith.</p>
      <p>The masses who passionately opposed the racist minority regime and supported black majority rule were slaughtered in cold blood.</p>
      <p>His wish, however, was for most freedom fighters to live to witness this cherished joyous occasion.</p>
      <p>He said: 'It was a bright day and everything was colourful. I could feel the new breeze. A lot was happening. Probably I could have enjoyed more if I was not too involved as part of the team that made sure everything was in order.'</p>
      <p>Fr Ribeiro, who has been a priest for the past 50 years, was the first black chaplain-general of the prisons, army and police during the Smith regime.</p>
      <p>The priest is discernibly uncomfortable talking about his personal experiences under Smith.</p>
      <p>But he worries that the spirit of the revolution might be lost.</p>
      <p>'I feel sad when I look at today's youngsters. Most of the youths are misguided, lawless and lack patriotism. The spirit of ubuntu has collapsed.</p>
      <p>'Most of the freedom fighters did not manage to see an independent Zimbabwe. Others did so but without limbs. It was sad noticing some of them dance to a new Zimbabwe in such a predicament. This is the reality that most of the current generation are not alive to,' he says.</p>
      <p>He believes the National Youth Service (NYS) might do the trick.</p>
      <p>The NYS was initially introduced in 2000 to mould youths into productive and responsible citizens, but later suspended due to funding constraints.</p>
      <p>The need to produce patriotic youths, Fr Ribeiro added, cannot be overemphasised.</p>
      <p>'When revived, some of the lectures should be conducted in prisons like the Harare Central, Chikurubi, Nyadzonia, Tembwe, Hwahwa and Sikombela as the places carry rich Zimbabwe history and need to be kept alive.'</p>
      <p>Covid-19 attack on Zim @40</p>
      <p>The nation was for the first time going to hold its independence celebrations at Barbourfields Stadium in Bulawayo.</p>
      <p>However, that is not going to be possible due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>'This is the biggest pandemic in the history of the world. Most people are currently concerned about their safety, economy and things like food scarcity. Thus, celebrating independence is secondary.</p>
      <p>'However, there is need to always value our past, especially after turning 40. The situation we find ourselves in is transient, but our land, sovereignty and pride should remain intact,' he says. Freedom does not have to be commemorated on one single day but it is has to be celebrated every day, said Fr Ribeiro.</p>

      <title>How long shall we suffer fools, loons?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Despite their supposed genius and intellectual heft, Western scientists are still grappling with establishing the causal link between lunar cycles and madness.</p>
      <p>While there is innumerable anecdotal evidence to suggest the moon could have an effect - unfailingly adverse - on the mental state of human beings, or even animals and insects, including irrefutable evidence that shows that some amongst us have routine and cyclical bouts of lunacy, conclusively establishing that link has been incredibly difficult.</p>
      <p>In fact, words such as 'lunatic', 'lunacy' and 'loon' were etymologically hewn from the Roman moon god called 'Luna'.</p>
      <p>US psychologists such as James Rotton and Ivan Kelly even subjected this theory to rigorous scientific inquiry.</p>
      <p>Well, Bishop Lazi, as a man given to spirituality and was known during his school days for an incurable numerophobia (fear of numbers) and arithmophobia (fear of arithmetic), doesn't lose sleep over all this scientific gobbledygook.</p>
      <p>The Bishop will not trouble himself with such senseless inquisition.</p>
      <p>In any case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</p>
      <p>Our ancestors once quipped: why do we have to measure the length of a snake with the buck of a tree when the reptile is actually there for the eyes to see?</p>
      <p>And the snake walked, still walks, on two legs in the form of my aunt.</p>
      <p>Depending on phases of the moon, especially when it is either shaped in the form of a waxing crescent or a waning crescent (mwedzi mutete), she is routinely transformed from sanity to rank madness.</p>
      <p>Argh! That woman!</p>
      <p>When she is in her zone of lunacy, she often scampers to the nearest anthill or molehill from whence she would launch into unending tirades that usually leave everyone emotionally bruised.</p>
      <p>However, we have become inured to it: we often take a cue from the moon to get a sense of when the next public village bashing would begin, or, conversely, we would hear from the verbal thrashing to know which phase of the moon cycle it was.</p>
      <p>But life, as it always does, also goes on in the village.</p>
      <p>It still does.</p>
      <p>So, if those two US psychologists are still interested in pursuing this subject matter further, kindly tell them to give the Bishop a buzz, he will happily provide them with a viable guinea pig.</p>
      <p>Looney Young Man</p>
      <p>We will also point them in the direction of that boy leading the rag tag opposition formation that is hurtling towards its congress next month.</p>
      <p>Yes, that boy who has wet dreams of one day becoming the man in Zimbabwean politics.</p>
      <p>Well, in Acts 2:17, the Lord says 'In the last days I will pour out My Spirit on all people; your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams', but Nelson Chamisa sees different kind of visions, if we could call them that.</p>
      <p>One would need a Richter magnitude scale to record his mood swings, including the way his mind seems to constantly zoom from being stable to being looney.</p>
      <p>The Bishop has already begun marking his calendar for the dates the young man is given to making bizarre statements with a view of extrapolating them to the various lunar cycles.</p>
      <p>At his rally on July 28 last year before the elections, the excitable and impressionable Chamisa told his starry-eyed supporters that Robert Mugabe was a welcome ally for the MDC-Alliance.</p>
      <p>In his own words, he said: 'Robert Mugabe is a citizen of Zimbabwe, former president, the president of the First Republic who is going to hand over to the second president of the Republic - myself here, present.' Kikikiki.</p>
      <p>We all know how it panned out.</p>
      <p>But you would swear by your mother that this is not the same guy who was bashing the same old man on Wednesday last week.</p>
      <p>'Mr Mugabe is one of the people who violated the rules of secrecy of the vote by indicating that he will vote for us. We are not in the business, as I have always indicated, of choosing supporters or voters.</p>
      <p>'The relationship (between him and Mugabe) is that of a former president and an incoming president. That is the relationship. Beyond that, there is no relationship.' Kikikiki.</p>
      <p>By the way, this is the same guy who organised 'the guys from Mbare' on August 1 last year to unleash Armageddon in Harare, but when it all came unstuck, he called the same 'guys from Mbare' stupid.</p>
      <p>Well, you might think this is an isolated case.</p>
      <p>Then - boom! - just after the independence celebrations, on April 19, his goons must have thought his Twitter account had been hacked.</p>
      <p>Their commander, who they affectionately refer to as Wamba Dia Wamba, was mellowing, they should have thought.</p>
      <p>'Where we are going now requires us to think and act together as Zimbabweans. Our dire situation is no longer about MDC or Zanu-PF but about Zimbabwe. We have a nation to build and a generation to defend. We have the power!' he tweeted away.</p>
      <p>Barely a week later, the tone had changed.</p>
      <p>He was now talking about how they cannot be a 2023 without a 2018 and a whole litany of other political mumbo jumbo.</p>
      <p>The next time you get confused about what he would be saying, just mark your calendar, dear reader, it would be useful in future.</p>
      <p>But as one writer once said, Chamisa is like that village urchin who is tolerated by the community as long as they stay away from the fireplace, for they risk burning down the whole village.</p>
      <p>The Bishop heard whispers last week that the young man is contemplating to again mobilise the muscle power from the 'guys from Mbare' under the guise of protesting against rising prices.</p>
      <p>And his retinue of media apologists are beginning to sound the war drums that will become the sound track of their envisaged offensive.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are no tutorials on Statecraft - the Bishop would have recommended one to the power-hungry political toddler. So, unfortunately, we will just watch him politically wither like Kizza Besigye of Uganda and Mmusi Maimane of South Africa, who have built unenviable reputations for perennially losing elections.</p>
      <p>Psychiatrists will actually have a field day with this chap on their couch.</p>
      <p>If I were patient enough, I would volunteer a therapy session with him, but Bishop Lazi doesn't suffer fools.</p>
      <p>Nor does the Holy Book.</p>
      <p>Proverbs 26 is particularly uncharitable.</p>
      <p>'Just as snow should not fall in summer, nor rain at harvest time, so people should not honour a fool.</p>
      <p>'Don't worry when someone curses you for no reason. Nothing bad will happen. Such words are like birds that fly past and never stop.</p>
      <p>'You have to whip a horse, you have to put a bridle on a mule, and you have to beat a fool.</p>
      <p>'There is no good way to answer fools when they say something stupid. If you answer them, then you, too, will look like a fool. If you don't answer them, they will think they are smart.' (verse 1-5)</p>
      <p>It adds: 'Never let a fool carry your message. If you do, it will be like cutting off your own feet. You are only asking for trouble.</p>
      <p>'A fool trying to say something wise is like a crippled person trying to walk.</p>
      <p>'Showing honour to a fool is as bad as tying a rock in a sling.</p>
      <p>'A fool trying to say something wise is like a drunk trying to pick a thorn out of his hand.'</p>
      <p>Argh!</p>
      <p>I guess we have no option but to accept that there is no village that doesn't have its fair share of looneys.</p>
      <p>But they must never - never ever - be allowed near the fireplace.</p>

      <title>Political stability remains elusive in Lesotho</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In 2017 the estranged wife of Lesotho's Prime Minister Tom Thabane was shot dead in suspicious circumstances two days ahead of his inauguration.</p>
      <p>Now there is a new twist in the saga: on January 11 authorities issued an arrest warrant for his current wife, Maesaiah Thabane, in connection with the murder.</p>
      <p>The scandal has erupted amid a bitter dispute within Thabane's All Basotho Convention and has culminated in his resignation.</p>
      <p>This is likely to destabilise the governing coalition, leading to an early general election and continued political instability in the small landlocked country of just over 2 million that is encircled by South Africa.</p>
      <p>Thabane served a stint as prime minister between 2012 and February 2015 when divisions within the then coalition government led to an early general election.</p>
      <p>The successor government led by Pakalitha Mosisili of the Democratic Congress was in turn rocked by divisions.</p>
      <p>After Mosisili lost a vote of no confidence, Lesotho was forced into another election in February 2017.</p>
      <p>In this latest contest, Thabane was returned to power at the head of a coalition led by his All Basotho Convention, backed by three other smaller political parties.</p>
      <p>Two days before Thabane's inauguration in 2017 his estranged wife, Lipolelo, who had refused to divorce him, was murdered.</p>
      <p>Her place was immediately filled by Thabane's customary law wife, Maesaiah.</p>
      <p>For the moment, Lipolelo's murder remained unsolved, one of those mysterious killings of prominent figures in Lesotho which occur all too frequently.</p>
      <p>Maesaiah went on the run after the police issued the arrest warrant and had still not been found nearly two weeks later.</p>
      <p>Maesaiah rapidly acquired notoriety for reputedly dictating who should be appointed to ministerial roles and who should be dismissed.</p>
      <p>She was accused of interfering directly with the allocation of government tenders.</p>
      <p>A trust fund she started, ostensibly to assist the poor and needy, was widely suspected to have been a money laundering scheme.</p>
      <p>Thabane was already on the losing end of a bruising struggle to retain control of his party when police announced they wanted to question Maesaiah in relation to Lipolelo's murder.</p>
      <p>He was left with little option but to resign.</p>
      <p>Seeds of discontent</p>
      <p>Lesotho is a poor country.</p>
      <p>Opportunities for employment in the private sector are few and far between.</p>
      <p>As a result there is a desperate scramble for jobs in government, the public services, the military and the police.</p>
      <p>Worse, because the demand for resources far outmatches the patronage available, Lesotho's political arena has become brutally competitive.</p>
      <p>It is characterised by battles between factions which stretch across the various political parties into the military and police.</p>
      <p>As a result, political life has been regularly punctuated by interventions by elements within the army.</p>
      <p>Lesotho's current malaise goes back to the assassination of the Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force, Brigadier Maaparankoe Mahao, in June 2015.</p>
      <p>Mahao had been promoted to the post by Thabane in place of Lieutenant-General Tlali Kamoli.</p>
      <p>The assassination resulted in intervention by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which launched an initiative to bring peace, stability and good governance to Lesotho.</p>
      <p>The aim was to try and keep the peace and bring about stability.</p>
      <p>Against this troubled background, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, acting as the facilitator of the reform process, managed to chivvy Lesotho's political parties into signing an agreement to establish a statutory National Legislative Reform Authority in mid-2019.</p>
      <p>The agreement was hailed as an achievement but even at the time, its prospects of success seemed to be belied by political realities.</p>
      <p>The question of who was responsible for Mahao's assassination has never been resolved.</p>
      <p>Two senior officers, both fervent supporters of General Kamoli, were under criminal investigation for his murder.</p>
      <p>But, they themselves were gunned down after they had just shot dead the latest commander of the army, General Khoantle Motsomotso, in early September 2017.</p>
      <p>All this frustrated the Mahao family immensely.</p>
      <p>Its bid to get at the truth was led by his brother Nqosa Mahao, Vice-Chancellor of the National University of Lesotho.</p>
      <p>It was also to lead to his direct involvement in politics.</p>
      <p>Changing of the guard</p>
      <p>Mahao had hitherto remained on the periphery of politics.</p>
      <p>But he emerged as the lead candidate for election to the deputy leadership of Thabane's All Basotho Convention at its elective conference in February 2019.</p>
      <p>Thabane immediately regarded him as a threat and resorted to court action to block his candidature.</p>
      <p>Conveniently, the case was heard by Acting Chief Justice Maseforo Mahase, who was appointed to the post by Thabane after he had suspended Chief Justice Nthomeng Majara from office some months earlier.</p>
      <p>Mahase ruled in favour of Thabane, but Mahao turned to the Court of Appeal.</p>
      <p>It overturned Mahase's judgment, recording scathing criticism of her decision.</p>
      <p>Mahao and his supporters proceeded to win the election and form a new National Executive Committee of the All Basotho Convention.</p>
      <p>But the result was immediately challenged by Thabane.</p>
      <p>Again the case went to court; again it was heard by Mahase; again Mahase ruled against Mahao and found reason to restore Thabane's National Executive Committee in office pending new party elections.</p>
      <p>Mahao inevitably went back to the High Court.</p>
      <p>It dealt with the case sporadically, until it finally declared in his favour in December 2019.</p>
      <p>Mahao's National Executive Committee immediately proceeded to suspend Thabane's membership of the party.</p>
      <p>But it made it plain he would remain prime minister until either he resigned or he lost a vote of confidence in parliament.</p>
      <p>It was a comprehensive defeat for Thabane.</p>
      <p>Uncertain times ahead</p>
      <p>The outcome of the present political turbulence is unclear.</p>
      <p>Mahao appears to be the most likely immediate successor to Thabane as prime minister.</p>
      <p>Yet, if he takes office, it will be at the head of an extraordinarily fragile coalition.</p>
      <p>Thabane's followers continue to dispute the legitimacy of Mahao's national executive committee.</p>
      <p>And Mahao will find securing a majority in parliament tough. In short, Lesotho seems destined for yet another election - the fourth in eight years.</p>
      <p>And, yet again, it seems unlikely that any party will win outright.</p>
      <p>The result will be another shaky coalition, with the related risk of further involvement by the military in the political arena.</p>
      <p>The SADC reform process was originally intended to be completed by the end of May this year.</p>
      <p>Currently there is no chance of that.</p>
      <p>If an election is called, there is no knowing what the outcome will bring, and SADC may have to go back to the drawing board.</p>

      <title>Kamambo charms councillors</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ZIFA councillors were left purring after the association parcelled out equipment and for the first time in the history of the domestic game injected finances into all its affiliates, including the Premier Soccer League.</p>
      <p>It emerged from the first annual meeting held under the leadership of Felton Kamambo in Harare yesterday that the board had broken with tradition and would share some of the FIFA Forward funds with the affiliate bodies.</p>
      <p>Yet the indaba had suffered a number of postponements before eventually being staged yesterday.</p>
      <p>After two hours of deliberations most councillors emerged from the conference of a Harare hotel a satisfied lot.</p>
      <p>ZIFA's four regions (Northern, Eastern, Central and Southern) received a financial injection of $40 000 while the provinces and women's regions got $30 000 and $20 000 respectively.</p>
      <p>Area Zones received $20 000 with tertiary and futsal also getting the same amount.</p>
      <p>All the 18 Premier Soccer League clubs got 10 balls each with a market value of about US$200 each.</p>
      <p>'Today was our first AGM, we had a fruitful discussion with the Congress where we briefed them on our achievements to date and where we want to take our football going forward,' Kamambo told the media after the meeting.</p>
      <p>'At the same time we also bought some equipment for all our affiliates. Each and every affiliate of ZIFA will receive some football equipment.</p>
      <p>'ZIFA as the head office will also channel some funding to all our affiliates, it could be a small amount but it's the idea that counts, it's also historic that ZIFA is going to give some funds to its affiliates and these are just the first steps of the journey.'</p>
      <p>The Congress also amended the ZIFA statutes to qualify the PSL as a member of the assembly with its elected chairman automatically becoming a member of the ZIFA board.</p>
      <p>'The amendment was basically in relation to Article 10 section 1(a) and also Article 32 section 1 of the ZIFA Statutes.</p>
      <p>'What it means is that PSL is also now a member (of the Congress) together with its clubs meaning to say that under the current statutes it was the clubs that the members of ZIFA but now PSL consisting of its clubs is now a member.</p>
      <p>'With regards to representation in the ZIFA executive committee, the PSL chairman will now be a member representing the PSL clubs,' said Kamambo.</p>
      <p>The move was welcomed by PSL chairman Farai Jere who will however have to wait longer before his push for a season changeover is adopted by the Congress.</p>
      <p>'As PSL we are excited by the change of statutes for the PSL to be a member of the ZIFA Assembly which has been a bone of contention for a long time.</p>
      <p>'But as for the change of season, in our last resolution there are some consultations which should have been done which we did not do, it's something that should be done now.</p>
      <p>'The Congress resolved that we should do countrywide consultations and we are going to do that,' said Jere.</p>
      <p>The PSL chairman has been pushing for season changeover from the current March-November to the international August-May calendar.</p>
      <p>ZIFA's move to provide funding and equipment for all its affiliates was welcomed by National Association for Primary Heads (NAPH) chairman Elton Sinyosi.</p>
      <p>'I was very happy, the meeting took very short usually we would go up to 5, the discussions were very fruitful and we are going to benefit a lot.</p>
      <p>'We have been given football equipment, cones, trophies and the like which will help us. Our wish was always for ZIFA to help us because we are the grassroots. All along they have been starting up there, but if they start from grassroots everything will be okay in football,' said Sinyosi.</p>
      <p>In its bid to revive junior football, ZIFA yesterday announced that national youths leagues across all provinces will commence in August.</p>
      <p>'The other approval is that of our Youth League which is going to kick off in August, and as ZIFA we also got equipment for all the youth league teams including the uniforms for the clubs that will participate.</p>
      <p>'Even the PSL, if they have youth teams they are also going to get that equipment,' said Kamambo.</p>
      <p>The 2018 audited financial accounts were also adopted at yesterday's meeting with Philemon Machana, the association's finance guru, revealing ZIFA had moved miles towards clearing a legacy debt that had soared to over $7 million.</p>
      <p>'We have gone $2 million in terms of payments so our debt now should be around $5 million,' said Machana.</p>
      <p>'We have started with what we call priority creditors, former ZIFA employees make this list, we have engaged each and every ex-employee of ZIFA one by one and of course we agreed on a payment plan, we have begun the payments,' Machana said. The case of suspended ZIFA vice president Gift Banda was not discussed in the Congress 'as the case is already within the judicial process.'</p>
      <p>Banda, who was a runaway winner in the battle for the ZIFA vice-presidency, was suspended on January 16 for allegedly reshuffling the Warriors technical team without the blessing of the board.</p>

      <title>Where to Warriors?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>AS Algeria's Desert Foxes were celebrating being crowned the 2019 African champions on Friday night, the Warriors' dismal performance was once again brought to the fore amid tough questions on the direction the senior team is taking as we now focus on the 2021 AFCON edition.</p>
      <p>Baghdad Bounedjah's early goal propelled them to a first Africa Cup of Nations title in 29 years after a fiery 1-0 victory over Sadio Mane's Senegal during Friday's final at the Cairo International Stadium.</p>
      <p>Bounedjah gave Algeria a dream start in the second minute when his deflected shot looped over Senegal goalkeeper Alfred Gomis, and it proved enough for the 1990 champions to lift the trophy on foreign soil for the first time.</p>
      <p>However, more worryingly for the Warriors is the manner in which the line-up of the 2019 Nations Cup teams badly exposed them as Algeria, Senegal, and Tunisia - who made the last four this year - were in the same Group B with Zimbabwe two years ago at the tournament in Gabon.</p>
      <p>Just two years ago, the Desert Foxes needed an 82nd Riyad Mahrez equaliser to grind a 2-2 draw against the Warriors, while runners-up Senegal beat Kallisto Pasuwa's men 2-0 and the Tunisian Carthage Eales secured a 4-2 triumph over the Warriors.</p>
      <p>Algeria finished third with two points, one above the Warriors.</p>
      <p>While the Warriors literary went to sleep post Gabon, only to wake up from their slumber when the 2019 qualifiers were starting, the Algerians were investing in their youth during the same period.</p>
      <p>On Friday night, before a huge and appreciative crowd in Cairo, the Algerians reaped huge rewards from their investment.</p>
      <p>Out of the four teams from the 2017 AFCON Group B, only Zimbabwe - who earned a point and four goals then - were worse off in the 2019 edition.</p>
      <p>The Warriors managed just a point and a single goal scored by Khama Billiat in the 1-1 draw against Uganda.</p>
      <p>Senegal bowed out at the quarter-final stage in Gabon two years ago but bounced back in style to reach Friday's final. All this begs the question… where exactly is Zimbabwean football going off the rail?</p>
      <p>Could it be poor planning, lack of continuity or outright lack of top class players who can rise to the occasion when it matters most?</p>
      <p>Six players who started Zimbabwe's opening match at the 2017 tournament - Tatenda Mkuruva, Costa Nhamoinesu, Hardlife Zvirekwi, Onismor Bhasera and Willard Katsande - have all disappeared from the Warriors' radar.</p>
      <p>Skipper Knowledge Musona, Nyasha Mushekwi and Billiat were the only players from the Class of 2017 who started in Zimbabwe's match against Egypt on the opening day of the 2019 edition on June 21. Since making an AFCON finals debut in Tunisia 15 years ago, Zimbabwe has never progressed beyond the group stage.</p>
      <p>The national team is in the habit of chopping and changing both coaches and players.</p>
      <p>The Warriors technical team also has a tendency of recycling ageing players at the expense of upcoming, exciting and energetic young players.</p>
      <p>Even when CAF changed the 2019 finals format to accommodate four best third placed teams into the knockout stage, the Warriors still crashed out at the first hurdle - without a win - despite being placed in what looked like a reasonable group.</p>
      <p>In their statement to the media on July 11, soon after the Warriors' return from the failed AFCON excursion, ZIFA apportioned part of the blame on alleged infiltration of the national team camp 'by a group of vengeful individuals bent on undoing the great work done by the current executive.'</p>
      <p>However, ZIFA president Felton Kamambo has spoken about the need to move on.</p>
      <p>Last week's pronouncement of the 2021 AFCON qualification groups should be a signal to ZIFA, and more importantly to the Warriors' coaches, that work should start now.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe was drawn into the same group with Botswana, Zambia and African champions Algeria.</p>
      <p>The qualifiers start in November.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe's first assignment after the AFCON shame is a two-legged African Nations Championship (CHAN) qualifier against Mauritius.</p>
      <p>The first leg is in Mauritius on July 28, with a reverse fixture coming a week later at home. The CHAN squad, set to be announced tomorrow, should set the tone for a new beginning for the Warriors.</p>
      <p>Given that the CHAN tournament is a development competition, the Warriors should unleash players below the age 30, with a bias towards the Under-23 players who will also compete against South Africa in the final UCAF Under-23 AFCON in September.</p>
      <p>Banking on players such as Ariel Sibanda, Lawrence Mhlanga, Partson Jaure as well as the injury prone duo of Qadr Amini and Ronald Chitiyo will be a retrogressive step in an era where the likes of Blessing Sarupinda, Anelka Chivandire, and Tymon Mvula should be flourishing and forming the basis of the squad for the 2021 AFCON and the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.</p>

      <title>Threats to Covid-19's new normal</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Coronavirus has forced staff in most companies to shift from brick-and-mortar workplaces to working from home, and resources are increasingly being deployed for them to seamlessly adjust to the new normal.</p>
      <p>Such adjustments include remotely accessing the company's network resources such as the internet, e-mails and confidential files through virtual private networks (VPNs) and private WiFi services.</p>
      <p>Where workers are accessing files and applications through cloud services, which enable remote access through almost any device, this has come with new threats.</p>
      <p>A survey conducted in August this year by Liquid Telecommunications Holdings - a pan-African telecommunications company with a footprint in over 13 countries across the continent including Zimbabwe - flagged increased cyber threats to companies since the outbreak of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>In fact, of the businesses that were interviewed, 57 percent registered an increase in cyber security threats over the period.</p>
      <p>'Cyber security is a real and imminent threat to businesses and their end-users, as highlighted by the survey commissioned in August 2020 by Liquid Telecom.</p>
      <p>'IT decision-makers across Africa were asked for their insights on cyber security trends, with 57 percent of those surveyed stating that they have seen an increase in threats over the pandemic period. While many employees across the continent are returning to work, organisations are embracing a hybrid model of digital and onsite working,' the company said in a statement last week.</p>
      <p>The biggest cybersecurity concerns that most businesses are facing include password compromise (72 percent), phishing or social engineering attacks involving fraudulent e-mails to steal personal information (67 percent), insider threats resulting of lack of awareness by the user (56 percent), and information stored in the cloud (53 percent).</p>
      <p>These threats were much more apparent in countries such as South Africa and Kenya.</p>
      <p>According to Liquid Telecom's chief executive officer Mr Nicholas Rudnick, what is even more worrying is that research has shown that it takes an average 228 days to identify a breach in the system, and by that time the liability to the company might be 'unlimited'.</p>
      <p>For some companies, the total cost of a breach is estimated at US$2,14 million.</p>
      <p>He said research has shown that 50 percent of corporate data is now in the cloud.</p>
      <p>Guaranteeing security in the cloud for most companies has become increasingly difficult as only 10 percent of applications might actually be sanctioned by the IT department, while 20 percent are user-led.</p>
      <p>Liquid Telecoms, however, opines that separating a company's network, cloud and cyber security naturally creates vulnerabilities that can easily open the door to cyber attacks.</p>
      <p>While the company, which has more than 70 000 kilometres of fibre across the continent, has been offering network and cloud services, last week it decided to launch its cyber security unit - Liquid Telecom Cyber Security Services - that is meant to offer a 'wholesome' and 'secure' package.</p>
      <p>The company's group chief digital officer, Mr David Behr, said it was leveraging on the expertise from some of the industry's biggest cyber security solution providers, which are its strategic partners, to create a secure network that is likely to be breach-proof.</p>
      <p>'Although we are unveiling the cyber security unit today (Wednesday), Liquid Telecom is not new to this space. We have successfully secured our own network for the past 15 years, and now through our strategic partnerships with Netskope, Logicalis, Microsoft and Cyber Risk Aware we have curated the best solutions in the industry to address the changing demands of a digitally transformed business world,' he said.</p>
      <p>Overall, through the new cyber security unit, Liquid intends to capitalise on its network, which already provides data, voice and IP services, and its cloud services - allowing for remote access of data in a company's system - to create a seamless system that can provide a secure network.</p>
      <p>Through tie-ups with partners such as Netscope, the cyber security unit intends to provide capabilities through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to guarantee secure access and systems, including the security of users (the workers accessing the system).</p>
      <p>It gives IT the ability to monitor what would be happening in the cloud and hence work to address the threats timeously.</p>
      <p>Due to the sheer volume of data that is processed through the system, it is believed that AI and machine learning can provide the capability to monitor while also ensuring low latency (minimal delays).</p>
      <p>It is believed that 90 percent of security incidents are caused by lack of awareness.</p>
      <p>But as working from home becomes the new normal that might even outlive the coronavirus, a new 'threat vector' is now on the horizon.</p>
      <p>'As social distancing became increasingly a mandate worldwide, so came a seemingly new threat vector - remote working,' said Mr Sizwe Zikhali, a senior solution architect at Microsoft, at a Webinar to mark the launch of Liquid Telecom Cyber Security Services last week.</p>
      <p>Companies are now focusing on keeping the new threats in check.</p>

      <title>Let's adopt solutions for commuters</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The rise in kombi fares last week was triggered by a shortage of fuel, although the reaction of drivers, and probably owners, was way over the top and even as fuel started flowing into service stations fares remained around 50 percent more than a week ago despite the drop from mid-week double fares.</p>
      <p>Several factors contributed to the fare crisis. First the buses run by Zupco and its franchise holders appeared significantly scarcer. The previous attempts by kombis to raise fares through the roof had been defeated by the arrival of the Zupco service. While the State-owned company could not even begin to cope with demand, enough buses from the vastly diminished Zupco fleet and those companies brought in to supply the basic service were enough to break the kombi cartels and force equivalent fares, or near equivalent fares. When supply rises to meet a fixed demand then the advantage moves to buyers and prices tend to fall.</p>
      <p>Fuel shortages at service stations for much of last week, meant many kombi drivers were queuing for hours to buy a full tank, reducing the number of kombis actually providing services at any one time. The laws of supply and demand now kicked in over the opposite direction. Demand for public transport is pretty constant. A sharp reduction in the number of seats, both in the large buses and kombis, meant that those still providing services could jack up prices.</p>
      <p>A curiosity in the business model for kombis increased the pressure to push up fares. Although the authorities talk about kombi operators, as if they are large companies providing transport services, this is not the case. Kombi owners maintain and license the kombis but rent them out by the day to the drivers for a fixed charge. Drivers are responsible for fuel and the daily fee. In effect every single driver is a kombi operator and performs this role as an independent contractor.</p>
      <p>To show a profit for a day, a driver has to carry enough passengers to cover his fuel and day-charge, plus the tout charges at formal and informal terminuses, and the sum he has promised his conductor. This explains some of the behaviour that so exasperates other road users: kombis weaving through traffic, jumping lanes without signals, and insisting on queuing at informal terminuses blocking streets.</p>
      <p>The same problem also helps explain some of the pressures on drivers to raise fees when they spend hours queuing for fuel. Some claim they are buying black-market fuel, which is probably a lie. But even if they were buying more expensive fuel that still drives up their total daily costs by far less than 50 percent. Fuel is not the largest cost for a kombi driver and even doubling fuel costs will have a far more modest impact on daily costs. An increase in daily rents by kombi owners is far more damaging.</p>
      <p>The reduction in buses and kombis on many routes, plus the higher kombi fares, had some exceptionally undesirable safety implications. The shortages meant more people were using pirate taxis, or even cadging lifts from passing motorists wanting to offset their fuel and other bills on their way to work or home. These drivers are neither licensed nor insured for public transport and many lack the skills standard. So what can be done?</p>
      <p>First the authorities have to ensure that the bus fleets operated by Zupco and its associates are kept on the road. This might well require special fuelling arrangements. In addition plans to expand the Zupco fleet must be accelerated. A Zupco bus is usually a first choice for passengers; the majority resort to other carriers because there are not enough Zupco buses.</p>
      <p>Secondly consideration needs to be given to assigning a priority to refuelling kombis. This could be tricky, since the plan would have to be to provide fuel for kombi operations, not fuel for a black market. But the ingenuity of cheats could be defeated by a number of measures: ration cards that had to be filled and stamped by participating service stations, locked fuel tank covers with keys kept at the service station, measuring devices.</p>
      <p>As with increasing the number of Zupco buses, cutting queues for kombis would also ensure that more were on the road at any one time, thus increasing the supply adequately to meet the demand at ordinary fares. Market forces can work in both directions. Whatever solution is adopted, we need a solution that ensures that there are adequate seats on offer to move commuters to and from work and school. Not everyone owns a car, and even if they did we should remember that even a single kombi replaces 15-30 cars on the road, relieving congestion, which admittedly is bad enough.</p>

      <title>Chicken Inn, Rhinos share spoils</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>CHICKEN Inn gaffer Joey Antipas conceded that they let two valuable points go down the drain after they were held by Black Rhinos in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Luveve yesterday.</p>
      <p>It was a game in which Antipas believes Rhinos employed some 'anti-football' tactics to grind a draw.</p>
      <p>'Two valuable points went down the drain in a very difficult match. Black Rhinos employed some anti- football tactics.</p>
      <p>'They didn't come out from their own half. They employed a 10-1 formation in a match we dominated for the entire 90 minutes,' said Antipas.</p>
      <p>The veteran coach added: 'Football fans use their hard earned cash to come and watch these games.</p>
      <p>'It was just disturbing to see Black Rhinos play that kind</p>
      <p>of football.'</p>
      <p>Rhinos coach Herbert Maruwa was however a happy man.</p>
      <p>'Our game plan worked so well. I told the boys to guard against conceding in the first half.</p>
      <p>'We also had to cut Chicken Inn's supply line to Clemence Matawu and Clive Augusto. It's a good result for us,' said Maruwa</p>
      <p>Augusto watched in disbelief when his close range effort from a Sipho Ndlovu feed was saved by a diving Ashly Rayners in third minute.</p>
      <p>That was to become Gamecocks' only clear cut chance in a game where the army side even used delaying tactics that affected the hosts rhythm.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks are now tied on 19 points together with CAPS United who take on Hwange at the Colliery this afternoon.</p>

      <title>Garanganga through to tour's final</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Takanyi Garanganga has no words to describe how grateful he is to his father, Brad, for the sacrifices he has made in his tennis career.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old, who will today meet Canada's Martin Beran in the ITF World Tour M15 singles final at Harare Sports Club, called his dad his biggest fan.</p>
      <p>'From day one till now he has still been helping out,' Garanganga told The Sunday Mail after his 6-4 6-3 semi-final win over Prajwal Dev of India yesterday.</p>
      <p>'I can't put into words how grateful I am to him.</p>
      <p>'The best thing is he lets me discover things for myself; I have been going out there meeting coaches, playing and he still funds those programmes.</p>
      <p>'He is not a person always on your neck…I am pretty fortunate to have that.'I could have never I asked to anyone for that type of support,' said Garanganga.</p>
      <p>The road has been challenging for the former African Junior Champion with his father, Brad, funding the bulk of Takanyi's expenses.</p>
      <p>'I am a father that says it all really,' said Takanyi's father.</p>
      <p>'When you have kids you want to raise them to be as best as they can be.</p>
      <p>'So obviously you give support to the extent possible.' For someone as talented as Takanyi who has reached a career best singles ranking of 288 and played a huge role in Zimbabwe's return to the Davis Cup Euro/Africa Group II, his father Brad feel the nation hasn't been supportive.</p>
      <p>'Any father would sacrifice for his children it's a given really, but I think Zimbabwe should have come to the party,' said Brad.</p>
      <p>'Zimbabwe could do more…Takanyi from where I see it, what he has tried to achieve under extremely constrained resource base he has been doing this for the Zimbabwean flag.</p>
      <p>'In other countries every player at that level has had support from the nation through private and public partnerships.</p>
      <p>'When he plays outside, the flag of Zimbabwe is there against his name so he is marketing his country,' he said.</p>
      <p>Other countries such as Australia and England have Payer Support Programs which cater for the players needs from a certain age.</p>
      <p>Professional and financial support is provided to high performing tennis players.</p>
      <p>The highest level of support available is allocated to players achieving and competing at the very highest level internationally.</p>

      <title>Anxiety over freak Zupco accidents</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>'Naturally, when you get into a Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (Zupco) bus, safety, with regards to the fitness of the vehicle, should be the least of your worries. We are made to believe the buses undergo rigorous testing before they are released on the roads,' reckons Takunda Mupara from Chiredzi.</p>
      <p>However, there have been growing concerns over the number of Zupco buses that have been involved in accidents over recent months. And most of the accidents, which often involve franchised vehicles, are being attributed to mechanical faults.</p>
      <p>'Since the start of the year, we have had 70 accidents. However, 95 percent of them were not fatal,' she said.</p>
      <p>'Just like any other company which operates a huge fleet, there is bound to be mechanical faults and accidents which may develop along the way,' said Zupco marketing and public relations officer Ms Sikhanyisiwe Ncube.</p>
      <p>'We conduct periodical vetting using a checklist to ensure that the buses are safe to ferry passengers. During off-peak times like weekends, part of the fleet is released for servicing.'</p>
      <p>Zupco took on board private commuter omnibuses (kombis) and conventional buses after Government announced an indefinite ban on private operators on May 16. The intervention is supposed to create an orderly mass public transport system. Only Zupco buses and those operating under its franchise are allowed to operate. The parastatal presently operates 831 buses and 896 commuter omnibuses under its franchise countrywide.</p>
      <p>However, they are fears some of the franchised buses are now compromising the quality of service that is synonymous with transport company. While some private operators are conveniently using Zupco stickers to continue operating, investigations indicated that some of the unfit vehicles were part of the parastatal's fleet. What has been most worrying is how some of the visibly unroadworthy vehicles are joining the fleet.</p>
      <p>Commuters want the public transport company to urgently deal with the matter.</p>
      <p>'The company needs to re-look at their safety mechanism and employ proper measures to safeguard passengers. They also need to hire adequate and experienced drivers to avert accidents,' said Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) president Mr Tafadzwa Goliati.</p>
      <p>There have been growing suspicions some of the buses are being corruptly cleared even after failing routine tests. This claim is, however, disputed by Government agencies responsible for certifying the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) director Dr Joseph Pedzapasi referred questions to the parent Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development. But Central Mechanical and Equipment Department (CMED) general manager Engineer Davison Mhaka rubbished the corruption claims.</p>
      <p>'We only do fitness tests for Zupco buses, so there is no need of any immunity,' he said.</p>
      <p>'VID does the bi-annual certificate on fitness and when the bus is engaged by Zupco, CMED will certify if the buses are roadworthy without prejudice.'</p>
      <p>Recently, a Zupco bus that ferries Sally Mugabe General Hospital staff was involved in a serious accident in Rugare suburbs in Harare, leaving many injured. Barely a week after the accident, a garage-bound Zupco bus belonging to Trip Trans veered off the road and hit vendors who were selling their wares by the roadside and eight cars at Mupedzanhamo Market in Mbare. During the same week, a Zupco bus suddenly lost control, got off its lane and hit a woman who was standing by the pavement in the central business district (CBD).</p>
      <p>Sadly, the driver is alleged to have continued with his journey as if nothing had happened.</p>
      <p>Also, at least 27 people were injured early this year after a Zupco bus they were travelling in veered off the road and landed on its side in Beatrice along the Harare-Masvingo highway. Further, seven people perished in Kwekwe, Kadoma and along Chiremba Road in Harare in accidents involving Zupco buses.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) attributes most of the accidents to human error and speeding. Government is in the process of acquiring brand new Zupco buses to boost its fleet. Fifty buses arrived from China early this month. But Zupco is also still accepting private operators that want to operate under its franchise, but they have to meet certain requirements, among them a letter of intention, certificate of fitness from CMED and vehicle insurance. The driver is expected to have a valid retest licence, a medical certificate, defensive driving certificate and Government Authority.</p>

      <title>Be part of Covid-19 response, say experts</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>HEALTH experts believe the country's response to coronavirus could be further strengthened by resolving transport challenges, impasse in the health sector and roping in communities to actively participate in preventing the spread of the disease, including extending care to patients who suffer from other ailments.</p>
      <p>From the time the continent recorded its first Covid-19 case in February, Zimbabwe has kept its caseload relatively low owing to an early lockdown and targeted responses to the outbreak.</p>
      <p>Strategies and responses are also continuously being adjusted to meet the ever-changing circumstances occasioned by the pandemic.</p>
      <p>At least 480 healthcare workers had contracted Covid-19 as of yesterday, while overall cases nationwide surpassed the 5 000 mark.</p>
      <p>This comes at a time when the pandemic is putting an enormous strain on the healthcare system, with many people struggling to access health services for other ailments.</p>
      <p>Further, the Covid-19 results turnaround time over the past three weeks has worsened, as the country has seen significant delays in the release of test results, which also means lost time in contact tracing.</p>
      <p>A case in point is the first results of tests carried out on Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) staffers, which came back 12 days later.</p>
      <p>ZBC announced on Tuesday last week that 30 of its staff members had tested positive for Covid-19 after tests were carried out on July 29.</p>
      <p>In addition, scores of journalists from various media houses who had their tests done on August 4 are yet to receive their results.</p>
      <p>Chief Co-ordinator for the National Response to Covid-19 in the Office of the President and Cabinet Dr Agnes Mahomva said while the country has done well in decentralising testing services, the absence of health workers at their workstations has made testing and contact tracing difficult.</p>
      <p>'We know, for example, that some of the places where the PCR is done have to transport the specimen to a central place. We have done a lot of work in terms of decentralising. When we started we only had this PCR only being done at Sally Mugabe Hospital, which is the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory, but it's still not exactly where we want, so we continue working on that,' said Dr Mahomva.</p>
      <p>'But also looking at the human resources component, I think many times people forget that the health sector is really struggling because of the strike that we are seeing. So, as long as we continue having those challenges, we continue to struggle with (results) turnaround time.'</p>
      <p>Community deaths</p>
      <p>On August 13, the country recorded 18 deaths in just 24 hours. Health experts attributed this to late presentation at hospitals, while most patients are shying away from health facilities for fear of being turned away due to a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p>Dr Shingi Bopoto, a surgical pathologist at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, said community deaths occurring outside a health facility could be directly or indirectly linked to Covid-19.</p>
      <p>'These could be people who die from complications of coronavirus infection and these people may have pre-existing conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and when they get Covid-19 they get multiple organ failure or some other form of complications that result in their death,' explained Dr Bopoto.</p>
      <p>'Then indirectly, we could have somebody who may have Covid-19 who dies from an accident, or suicide or complications of maternal deaths or child deaths. These become Covid-19-related deaths, but not Covid-19 deaths so to speak.'</p>
      <p>Provision of health services for other ailments such as malaria, diabetes, and HIV and Aids among various other conditions, he added, have been severely disrupted.</p>
      <p>'A lot of resources - human, infrastructural and logistical - have been diverted to fight Covid-19, so people who would ordinarily access care for other conditions such as people on ARVs, people taking blood pressure medicines, diabetes medicines, can no longer access care because it's now in short supply,' he</p>
      <p>said.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Medical Association (ZiMA) president Dr Francis Chiwora said most people had stopped going to health institutions for services.</p>
      <p>'The usual diseases that afflict the population were there before the Covid-19 era, during and will be there even after,' said Dr Chiwora.</p>
      <p>'Looking at the patterns of admission into hospitals since lockdown, there is more than 60 percent reduction in admission of patients with various conditions, and this data was only focusing on obstetrics and gynaecology, so imagine all the other diseases.</p>
      <p>'Admission has been seriously curtailed because sometimes they are being turned away from institutions while others are staying at home.'</p>
      <p>Dr Chiwora said private hospitals remained largely inaccessible because of high costs. There are fears that some patients could be dying at home.</p>
      <p>Transport factor</p>
      <p>When the lockdown began on March 30, private commuter omnibuses were banned indefinitely. Zupco now has the sole mandate to transport the commuting public.</p>
      <p>This has, however, resulted in acute public transport shortages, mainly in Harare and Bulawayo.</p>
      <p>Medical experts warn this is threatening Covid-19 containment efforts, as commuters are hardly practising social distancing while in queues.</p>
      <p>Dr Chiwora said: 'The issues of social distancing and wearing of masks should work very well, but it doesn't seem to be working if we compare ourselves with other countries within the region and I believe one of the areas we are failing is in the transport sector . . .</p>
      <p>'Whatever strategy we are applying, I think we should look into issues of easing public transport woes so that people can have choices and observe social distancing. I think that is one major area where we are missing it,' he said.</p>
      <p>Patients' privacy</p>
      <p>The pandemic brought about challenges in terms of patients' privacy, as sick people are now required to justify their movements at various security checkpoints.</p>
      <p>Stakeholders worry that patients' privacy is violated in the process as some security officers do their checks. Community Working Group on Health executive director Mr Itai Rusike is advocating for the inclusion of security personnel with medical background at roadblocks in order to protect patient confidentiality and privacy.</p>
      <p>'Government may need to think further and strategise on how best patients can access services and passage at security checkpoints without sharing their medical records to non-medical personnel at the various security checkpoints.</p>
      <p>'We need to be guided by the Public Health Act and the Patients Charter on patients' confidentiality and privacy that clearly states that a patient shall have the right for the details of their medical records to be treated as confidential and ensure reasonable privacy,' said Mr Rusike.</p>
      <p>Solutions</p>
      <p>Now that there is ample evidence that Covid-19 has penetrated communities and spreading, experts say there is need for health literacy and community participation.</p>
      <p>Mr Rusike suggested that intensive awareness campaigns in communities are now critical to ensure that the general public plays an active role in the country's response to Covid-19.</p>
      <p>He said public response to the pandemic is not the responsibility of the health system alone.</p>
      <p>'It also calls on public information, availability of safe water, soap, food, job security and social protection and the work of many other sectors.'</p>
      <p>Senior Hospital Doctors Association president Dr Shingai Nyaguse called for a solution to the current impasse between healthcare workers and their employer to ensure that the public has access to health services.</p>
      <p>'The most urgent thing is to deal with the issue of health workers that has paralysed service delivery, both for Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 services,' said Dr Nyaguse.</p>
      <p>'Then continue to liaise and inform, take the lead in the Covid-19 response nationally and reassure the citizens of Zimbabwe that the health sector is now geared to meet all their needs.'</p>
      <p>Dr Chiwora said the appointment of a substantive minister was welcome.</p>
      <p>'We are very happy that we now have a substantive minister and we hope that he will address the issues that are affecting the health delivery system,' he said.</p>
      <p>'The health sector is in serious problems. The institutions, both private and public, need to be capacitated in terms of infrastructure, equipment, medicines and laboratory testing kits, and this should be addressed almost immediately.'</p>
      <p>Harare City Health Services director Dr Prosper Chonzi said while it may be too late to introduce targeted lockdowns due to the spread of the disease, there was need for Government to realign efforts to ensure that the available resources are channelled to the right areas of response.</p>
      <p>'What is more important is for us to go back to the basics of outbreak control. What are the steps in determining how you respond to an outbreak? The first one being establishing the existence of an outbreak, which we have already done.</p>
      <p>'We now know that we have a pandemic, we know that people with symptoms are the ones that we refer and these are the ones who should be in community or hospital set-up. We need to use case definition of Covid-19, we do not have to solely depend on testing because our capacity to test is very low.</p>
      <p>'Once we do that we stop relying on testing, so we need to use other epidemiological means to identify cases and respond appropriately. We now need to come up with community interventions not laboratory-based,' said Dr Chonzi.</p>
      <p>'Once we are able to test everybody, we do that but for now we need to refocus our strategies and align those with our resources and ability to respond.</p>
      <p>'It might be a bit too late to do a targeted lockdown because it seems like we now have a huge outbreak across the country. We may need to then look at certain hotspots in certain parts of our district, but that action would need to be backed scientifically,' he said.</p>

      <title>Price madness hits agric sector</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The price increase madness obtaining throughout the country could reverse recent gains made in the agricultural sector, farmers have warned.</p>
      <p>The warning comes at a time when the country has made remarkable strides towards regaining self-sufficiency in agricultural production since production fell sharply in 2002.</p>
      <p>At 238 kilograms, tobacco output broke the all-time high record of 236 kilograms achieved in 2001.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, maize deliveries to the Grain Marketing Board have already surpassed the 1,1 million tonne mark for the second year running.</p>
      <p>Wheat, cotton and soya bean have also made impressive gains with production improving by over 50 percent.</p>
      <p>Much of the success is owed to out-grower schemes backed by both the Government and the private sector.</p>
      <p>The achievements earned farmers increased income, which enabled them to expand their operations.</p>
      <p>However, these gains could be reversed due to the skyrocketing prices for inputs.</p>
      <p>Farmers say this season, the cost of production in the agricultural sector could consequently rise by at least 30 percent.</p>
      <p>This comes as a result of unrestricted parallel money market and speculation.</p>
      <p>Farmers also lament that the development could wipe out their investments if they fail to recover their costs.</p>
      <p>It is particularly the imported items that have gone higher as suppliers use foreign currency to import.</p>
      <p>Suppliers have also taken advantage of the situation to speculate the prices of locally-manufactured goods, thereby pushing the prices higher.</p>
      <p>Farmers have also lamented that the obtaining instability has disrupted strategic planning as most had already planned for the whole season.</p>
      <p>A survey carried out by The Sunday Mail Society showed that most retailers, both informal and formal, had hiked the price for fertiliser with a 50 kilogramme bag of Ammonium Nitrate selling at between $55 and $65.</p>
      <p>Compound D was not available in most retail outlets but was reported to be selling at $55 per 50kg bag.</p>
      <p>These are significant increases from the 2016/17 season when fertiliser sold at $27 for the same quantities.</p>
      <p>A 5kg bag of maize seed costs between $17 and $18,50, depending on the variety while a 10kg bag costs between $32,50 and $40 and a 25kg bag is selling for between $79 and $88.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) president, Mr Wonder Chabikwa confirmed the developments.</p>
      <p>'They (suppliers) would not admit it but the fact is that the prices have gone up. You go to the supplier and they tell you they don't have the product but then you find it in a certain shop going for a very high price,' he said.</p>
      <p>'As such, we see a rise in cost of production by between 30 and 40 percent and this could be bad news for farmers.</p>
      <p>'This has impacted very negatively in terms of planning for the farmers because most had already completed their budgeting.'</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Farmers Union director, Mr Paul Zakariya weighed in, saying there has been an increase in the price of imported agricultural products.</p>
      <p>'The situation is not as bad as it is with basic commodities but we are facing challenges, especially for imported items like chemicals. We are also anticipating a rise in tillage costs because the cost of equipment such as tractors has gone up by up to 100 percent.</p>
      <p>'A 75 horsepower tractor, which not so long ago was going for a figure around $30 000, is now around $65 000.</p>
      <p>'The price hikes are pushing the cost of production higher and this could reverse the gains registered in the last few years.</p>
      <p>'We hope that the market will respond favourably, otherwise farmers will not be able to recover their costs.'</p>
      <p>In 2016, it cost roughly $1 055 per hectare to produce dry land maize and over $1 500 per hectare for the irrigated crop.</p>
      <p>Figures provided by ZCFU showed that on labour costs per hectare, most farmers used $95 from planting to harvesting, while $47,43 was needed for a 25kg bag of seed to cover a hectare.</p>
      <p>Other costs included $384,24 for fertiliser, $38,58 for herbicides, $8,70 for insecticides, $31,50 for grain bags, $60,38 for transport, $7,32 for insurance, $7,98 on levies and $9,73 for sundry expenses.</p>
      <p>Indirect costs related to operating a tractor were $193,79 for fuel, $72,02 for oils, $19,08 for filters and $7,08 for tyre punctures.</p>
      <p>When all the figures are added, the total - depending with the area - was between $982,82 and $1 055 per hectare. However, most of the prices have since increased by 50 to 100 percent, with most of the items only available on the black market.</p>
      <p>Given the current situation, farmers could incur costs of over $1500 to finance a hectare of maize.</p>
      <p>However, with farmers struggling to achieve even yields, it may be difficult for them to produce a crop that gives them $1 500 per hectare basing on the current producer price of US$390.</p>
      <p>According to official figures, the overall maize yield per hectare has, for the past couple of years, been averaging around 0,85 tonnes per hectare.</p>
      <p>Using the current producer price, this has a value of US$331, 50.</p>
      <p>In South Africa and Zambia, it costs between R7 500 and R9 000 to produce a hectare of maize, which is about $700 and $850 when converted to United States dollars.</p>
      <p>Farmers say the high cost of inputs such as fertiliser, seeds, pesticides, and farming machinery is making farming expensive.</p>
      <p>Most farmers said they are now relying on Command Agriculture to sustain their operations, while some communal farmers are banking on the Presidential Well-Wishers Inputs Scheme.</p>

      <title>Thankful for fast feet</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>TINOTENDA MATIYENGA once told his widowed mother that his quick feet would take him far.</p>
      <p>Those quick feet have already taken Matiyenga, who turns 19 tomorrow, to the United States where he is on scholarship at Texas Christian University.</p>
      <p>However, the sprinter they nicknamed Booster at Prince Edward High School says he is not done yet.</p>
      <p>'The Olympics and the World Championships are my biggest goals,' said Matiyenga.</p>
      <p>'Here in the States I have everything I have always wanted back home, a gym, a track physio on my beck and call and I'm sure I will improve without a doubt.'</p>
      <p>But before he steps onto the Olympic stage Matiyenga first has to deal with the IAAF World U20 Championships in Finland this week.</p>
      <p>He is one of seven Zimbabwean athletes expected to participate at the U20 Championships from July 10-15.</p>
      <p>The speedster heads to Finland against the backdrop of having achieved his personal best time of 10.27 in 100m during a meet in Austin a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>'The time I spent training and working hard seems to be paying off,' said Matiyenga who is now based in a land where stories of mothers who have been pillars in their sons' sports careers are common.</p>
      <p>In NBA, Golden State's Kevin Durant and Houston Rockets' James Harden are some of the stars whose mothers played a huge supportive role in their careers.</p>
      <p>It is something Matiyenga can relate to as he lost his father when he was just one year old.</p>
      <p>'Mum is my hero,' said the sprinter.</p>
      <p>'She has made me push for the best, supporting me and making sure I did not quit.'</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Matiyenga's mother, Memory, insists it's all about God's grace.</p>
      <p>'Tino's father passed on when he was only one-year and a month old, now he is turning 19 pursuing what he loves. It can only be God's grace,' she said.</p>
      <p>'I realised his talent when he was still at Hallingbury Primary School where the school exempted him from paying fees because at that time he was the fastest in the country in his age group.</p>
      <p>'I remember declaring that it was the beginning of many scholarships for him and I am glad God opened them. I urge all parents to support their children in pursuing their dreams.'</p>

      <title>Ghana: Lessons to be learnt from excess power</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Corruption, inflexible contracts and administrators failing to take action have condemned Ghana to overpaying for a generation.</p>
      <p>Access to energy plays a critical role in economic development. But bad government policies have affected energy security in many developing countries.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that two out of three households (almost 600 million people) in sub-Saharan Africa have no access to electricity. Ghana has also had its challenges. A shortage of generating capacity led to rationing in 2014 and 2015, with serious consequences for the economy.</p>
      <p>Nearly five years later the country faces the exact opposite problem: excess electricity. Ghana's Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta set out the scale of the problem in his mid-year review budget on July 29. He said that the problem posed grave financial risks to Ghana's economy. This is because the government is carrying legacy debt in the energy sector, which threatens to put a huge strain on its finances.</p>
      <p>According to Ofori-Atta, plans have been put in place to deal with the challenges in the energy sector. A recommendation has since been made to Parliament to support the renegotiation of all take-or-pay contracts to take-and-pay.</p>
      <p>How did Ghana move from not having enough power five years ago, to being burdened with a massive energy bill as well as too much electricity?</p>
      <p>At the heart of Ghana's problem was how it responded to the power shortages in 2014. These hit the economy hard, leading to the mining and manufacturing sectors contracting, and unemployment going up. To address the problem, the government fast-tracked private power plants. The current glut in electricity - as well as the cost overheads - can be attributed directly to the way in which the contracts were drawn up.</p>
      <p>Ghana's experience is a cautionary tale for countries that find themselves in a situation of having too much electricity at any given point. Without careful forward planning, proper data-driven analysis, and transparent, competitive, corruption-free contracting processes, any country could find itself in the same situation as Ghana.</p>
      <p>Due to challenges with public financing of energy infrastructural projects, many countries - including Ghana - have been turning to the private sector for investment in the energy sector. As a result independent power producers are receiving much more attention on the continent.</p>
      <p>At the heart of Ghana's energy sector challenges were the take-or-pay contracts signed by the government. To address the shortfalls it was facing, it contracted three emergency power producers during the 2014 - 2017 period. The contracting was done without a competitive process. On top of this the government signed 43 power purchase agreements.</p>
      <p>But the demand for electricity never went up at the anticipated rate due to tariff increases and slow economic growth. As a result, the plants ended up producing excess capacity. The installed capacity according to the Energy Commission of Ghana is 5 083 MW, almost double the peak demand of 2 700 MW. Of this, 2 300 MW has been contracted on a take-or-pay basis. This means that Ghana is contractually obliged to spend money for excess capacity that's not being consumed.</p>
      <p>The result is that the government is paying over US$500m (almost Ghana Cedis 2,5 billion) annually for power generation capacity that's not being used.</p>
      <p>There is also an overhang for gas. And because the government contracted gas supply on a take-or-pay basis, it must pay whether the gas is utilised or not. Thus, from 2020, if nothing changes, Ghana will face annual excess gas capacity charges of between US$550 and US$850 million yearly. This is even after the current government terminated two other liquefied natural gas contracts in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ghana's excess electricity problem - and its solution - boils down to the arrangements made with independent power producers.</p>
      <p>The contracting process failed to avoid a number of pitfalls. These included:</p>
      <p>A lack of flexibility in contracts. The terms and conditions are often difficult to change once purchase power agreements are signed because of a fear of putting off future investors.</p>
      <p>Fixing prices in foreign currency exchange, typically US dollars.</p>
      <p>Threatening competition. According to a World Bank report, independent power producers often suffocate competition once in operation. There is huge potential for inefficiencies if the independent power producers meet a large share of the load.</p>
      <p>Inflated prices: the World Bank report argues that independent power producers often inflate supply prices for utilities, which raises end-user prices.</p>
      <p>Currency risk protection: unlike other foreign investments, investors in independent power producers are often shielded from currency risk. Most negotiate take-or-pay contracts where all the power generated must be bought whether needed or not. Because payments are made in dollars, this becomes more like international debt than equity investment.</p>
      <p>Corruption. This often creeps in when the stakes are high in contract negotiations. They are often done secretly and only become visible when there is a change of government. As the Public Services International Research Unit puts it: 'Establishing power generation in excess of the country's requirements is a feature associated with corruption … if the process provides an income source for those negotiating the contracts'.</p>
      <p>Political expediency. According to a Business Insurance report 'the fundamental problem with creating independent power producers in developing countries is that initially it is based on political expediency. These things sometimes bear no relation to economic reality.'</p>
      <p>Independent power producers have contributed immensely to Ghana's quest to meet its power generational capacity. But lessons from Ghana's excess electricity challenges show that unless negotiations are done with utmost transparency and care, agreements that are struck can pose financial risks and breed corruption.</p>
      <p>This precautionary principles would save many countries from experiencing the same fate as Ghana.</p>

      <title>Zimbabweans lack savings culture</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Zimbabwean workers are simply not saving enough, reflecting high levels of unnecessary consumption, a new report has shown.</p>
      <p>Experts says a national savings culture is a fundamental economic and social objective, especially for the youths.</p>
      <p>Latest findings contained in the report 'Harnessing the Demographic Dividend in Zimbabwe' - jointly carried out by Government, through the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF) - show that there is a disproportionate bias towards consumption relative to labour income.</p>
      <p>'Average annual consumption per person is higher than average labour income per capita from infancy to age 29. Over a range of 24 years between the ages of 30 and 35, mean per capita labour income exceeds per capita consumption.</p>
      <p>'Thereafter, labour income again falls below the level of consumption. In sum, individuals under the age of 30 and those aged 54 years and above contribute to the dependency burden in Zimbabwe,' reads part of the report.</p>
      <p>Local banker and analyst Clive Mphambela believes that a holistic approach is required for Zimbabwe to start building a national savings culture.</p>
      <p>'To save Zimbabwe - to grow the economy and to develop the means to deal with the problems like poverty - we must undertake a drive to save and build our national savings.</p>
      <p>'If more citizens opt to save through mechanisms such as savings accounts with the banks, endowments and retirement schemes with insurance entities, more capital will be made available to increase the productive capacity of the economy.</p>
      <p>'This will be achieved through the underlying investments in the private sector (through loans to companies and investments in shares in companies, for example).</p>
      <p>National savings can also be channelled to infrastructure investments and through Government schemes (such as Government bonds and Treasury Bills),' he wrote in one of his columns on the issue.</p>
      <p>'At present, Zimbabwe's economic future development is heavily dependent on fickle and very timid foreign capital.</p>
      <p>'Massive amounts of foreign direct investments are required but these will not come if our own capacity to accumulate resources is not tested.</p>
      <p>'At the micro level, improved household savings will benefit individuals and ease the stressful levels of personal debt among consumers.'</p>
      <p>According to the joint Government and UNPF report: 'The underlying consumption profile for Zimbabwe relative to peak labour income suggests that some form of transfer, with the likelihood of remittances, finances the high levels of consumption.</p>
      <p>'It also means that Zimbabwean households are unlikely to make significant savings that can be invested to boost the economy. This has negative implications for the magnitude of the first demographic dividend that Zimbabwe can harness.'</p>
      <p>Mphambela, however, blamed low savings on lack of confidence in the financial system.</p>
      <p>'Lack of confidence in the financial system is always a key impediment to saving in the economy. In Zimbabwe, the confidence of savers was severely dented by the demise of the Zimbabwe dollar in the broader context, while at the micro level, a number of bank failures have occurred in our system that have created a negative perception of banks.'</p>
      <p>Demographic dividend refers to a situation where a country enjoys accelerated economic growth that stems from the decline in fertility and mortality rates and growth in the economically active population.</p>
      <p>Findings of the report suggest that Zimbabwe entered the demographic dividend window around 2004, which peaked in 2012 and is projected to last until 2060.</p>
      <p>The demographic dividend window is a period when a nation's proportion of the working age group is most prominent. This occurs when the population is predominantly younger and percentage of the economically active is at its height.</p>
      <p>'Because of the high levels of consumption relative to labour income, Zimbabwe has a lifecycle deficit - the difference between labour income and consumption,' highlighted the report.</p>
      <p>Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube said to harness the demographic dividend, Government had to contain runaway birth rates, especially in the adolescent age group by encouraging the group to further their education, while promoting use of contraceptives.</p>
      <p>'Harnessing the demographic dividend requires that Government, civil society, business, development partners, and the nation at large jointly address the increasing adolescent fertility rate through keeping adolescents in school and colleges and creating jobs for them.</p>
      <p>'Making it easy for them to access family planning information, services and designing programmes which will encourage contraceptive use intended to delay the first birth within marriage,' he said.</p>

      <title>Zim embraces clean-up plan</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Almost a year ago, President Emmerson Mnangagwa launched the National Environment Cleaning Day, declaring his Government's commitment and desire to provide a clean environment through a sustainable waste disposal programme.</p>
      <p>The President stressed the importance of a clean environment.</p>
      <p>'The world we live in is deteriorating rapidly due to the dire consequences of climate change which manifests as floods, heat waves, diseases, water and air pollution, land degradation and desertification among other challenges,' he declared.</p>
      <p>'These developments require us to take bold and decisive action with regards the management of our environment of ensuring a clean environment. We need to keep our villages, towns and cities clean and hygienic, both for this generation and generations to come.</p>
      <p>'We must, therefore, be reoriented to practise good environmental and waste management through increased advocacy, education, training and awareness.'</p>
      <p>Since then, between 8am and 10am of every first Friday of the month, Zimbabweans in all parts the country participate in a nationwide clean-up exercise.</p>
      <p>Themed 'Zero tolerance to litter: My environment, my pride', the campaign is now nearly one year old.</p>
      <p>According to the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), Zimbabweans, particularly corporates, have been at the forefront of driving the initiative.</p>
      <p>EMA environmental educational and publicity manager Ms Amkela Sidange says there was a surge in the adoption of certain sections of road islands by corporates, a move stemming from the National Environment Cleaning Day.</p>
      <p>'We have observed that there is a behavioural change in communities and the corporate world since the introduction of the National Clean-up Day,' she explained.</p>
      <p>'We have more corporates coming to support the initiative, they have formed structures and most of them no longer wait for the first Friday of the month.</p>
      <p>'There has also been an increase of corporates adopting road islands. For example, if you look at road islands in Samora Machel Avenue; this has been done to complement the clean-up campaigns.'</p>
      <p>Ms Sidange also said residential areas were slowly taking up the initiative.</p>
      <p>'We are also witnessing communities in the residential suburbs who are complementing the initiative of these clean-up campaigns.</p>
      <p>'In areas such as Sunningdale high- density suburb in Harare, there are communities that observe the first Friday of every month and hold clean-up campaigns voluntarily.</p>
      <p>'We are hoping such initiatives cascades to other residential areas across the country.'</p>
      <p>The campaign is modelled on the 'Umuganda' - a community clean-up held on the last Saturday of every month in Rwanda.</p>
      <p>But in Rwanda, the clean-up is not a volunteer project, officials monitor participation.</p>
      <p>Police can stop Rwandese who are not participating and order them to undertake any clean-up on the spot.</p>
      <p>Small fines are also charged for not participating.</p>
      <p>The Rwandese government institutionalised a clean-up campaign strategy which makes it compulsory for all able-bodied people between the ages 18 and 65 to participate in the national clean-up campaign.</p>
      <p>Rwanda has also banned the use of plastics. This approach has seen the country being renowned throughout the world for its cleanliness.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, in Zimbabwe, participation is yet to reach the Rwandan levels</p>
      <p>It is still largely a programme for officials and corporates, with negligible buy-in from the public.</p>
      <p>Harare City Council corporate communications manager Mr Michael Chideme says littering remained a challenge in the capital city.</p>
      <p>He, however, said the increase in the number of participating corporates was encouraging.</p>
      <p>'We have noticed that there is an increase in the number of individuals and corporates that participate on the day,' said Mr Chideme.</p>
      <p>'Council has not done any behavioural change analysis. However, we have noticed that people are still littering as evidenced by the amount of dirt that is in the streets around 11am in the CBD everyday.</p>
      <p>'The existing by-laws are being enforced and we are working with EMA and the ZRP. As council we do not have arresting powers.'</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Government banned the use of polystyrene material, commonly known as kaylite, and related plastic packaging citing health hazards and pollution.</p>
      <p>Ms Sigande said the move reduced litter and saw an increase in citizens actively participating in plastic recycling.</p>
      <p>'There is an improvement in recycling of plastic bottles,' she added. 'This complements the clean-up campaigns.'</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is preparing for another clean-up on December 6.</p>

      <title>Tarzan sizzles but fails to pop</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>FOR some reason, 'The Legend of Tarzan' almost escaped me during the course of this year.</p>
      <p>I watched the movie a couple of months ago but it never occurred to me to sit down and write my take on this colossal disappointment of a movie.</p>
      <p>After all, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year and after the success that was 'Jungle Book', it only makes sense that there should have been some sort of excitement around the movie's release. If not from you, the audience, then at least from me.</p>
      <p>'The Legend of Tarzan' is yet another remake from the ever-charging Warner Brothers Pictures. The storyline was refreshingly different but not perfect. The performances top notch, but not memorable.</p>
      <p>Prior to its release, everything else seemed to be pointing at another hit, but the end result was a forgettable flop. Such is the paradox of 'The Legend of Tarzan'.</p>
      <p>Its biggest weakness is that in its attempt at originality and creativity, the film got lost. We will delve on that point later.</p>
      <p>'The Legend of Tarzan' follows the life of our favourite Ape-man well after he has been raised by apes, met Jane and escaped the jungle to return home to London.</p>
      <p>As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Congo Basin is claimed by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the Kingdom of Belgium. He has basically cut out the Congo basin from the rest of the world.</p>
      <p>The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge amounts of money to finance the construction of railways and other infrastructure projects in Africa. In response, he sends his envoy Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar to finance his operations.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Rom's team is ambushed and massacred by the natives, leaving Rom as the sole survivor. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), then offers him the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy - Tarzan.</p>
      <p>This sets in motion an elaborate plan, which lures Tarzan from England where he has been living under his birth name John Clayton III with wife Jane Porter (Margot Robbie).</p>
      <p>Tarzan accepts an 'invitation' from Leopold, to visit Africa. He soon finds himself reconnecting with old friends and animals and at loggerheads with both Chief Mbonga and Rom.</p>
      <p>After years of reboots and origin stories, it is quite refreshing that writers Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer chose to give us a totally different take on the Tarzan story.</p>
      <p>Whether that was a good or bad story is another issue altogether, but the mere fact that they gave us a new story deserves credit.</p>
      <p>With huge talents such as Samuel L. Jackson (George Washington Williams), Margot Robbie (Jane), Christoph Waltz (Leon Rom), Djimon Hounsou (Mbonga) and Alexander Skarsgard (Tarzan); it was almost a guarantee that the performances would be top notch.</p>
      <p>Waltz is obviously the star of the show as he embodies the ego maniacal, calculating Leon Rom. His accents give me thrills. I am a big fan of how the guys seem to have mastered the whole villain plot.</p>
      <p>Big Sam is big Sam. Hounsou and Skarsgard really do not do much, but they seem to have grasped the essence of their roles. They are big, muscular and scary.</p>
      <p>Much like Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie simply has to be herself and our job is to enjoy her in all her glory. The imagery, cinematography and dialogue is really great. But there is a lack of balance.</p>
      <p>First of all, the Computer Generated Images are lousy and ruin the audiences' viewing. I can only imagine how terrible the animals, particularly the apes and lions, look like in 3D.</p>
      <p>When you take a children's classic like Tarzan, it is almost obvious who the target audience is. An unrepentant 32-year-old man-child like myself considers it a gift that I can still sit down to some of these children's films or yester-year classics with such glee.</p>
      <p>I consider it a gift that I am still in touch with my inner child that I can still revel in these things from my past and enjoy them like there are brand new.</p>
      <p>I did not get that with this movie.</p>
      <p>As I sat through this 110 minute film, I found it hard to comprehend some of the imagery. For a film with an age restriction of 12 years, strong slave trade undertones in scenes where black men are chained at the neck, and gratuitous violence, are hardly appropriate.</p>
      <p>The film lacks the fun and excitement expected from such a childlike story. Some of the tale's iconic characters were not even mentioned. Also, some of the real life historical characters and facts are totally wasted on its target audience.</p>
      <p>The finale and third act is totally ruined by an elaborate CGI filled action sequence. The flashbacks are of no connection or relevance to the main story of the day and act only as a reminder of whose story (Tarzan) they are trying to tell.</p>
      <p>In my books, and most importantly in film, this is referred to as 'laziness'.</p>

      <title>Meikles Hotel sale approved</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Zimbabwe's world acclaimed five-star hotel, Meikles Hotel, is set to change hands after the Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) approved its sale to Albwardy Investment, a Dubai-based entity.</p>
      <p>In a board resolution released last week, the CTC said it had approved, without conditions, the proposed acquisition of the Meikles Hotel business from Meikles Hospitality by Albwardy Investment through its firm ASB Hospitality Zimbabwe Ltd.</p>
      <p>ASB Hospitality Zimbabwe is a special purpose vehicle of Albwardy Investment, which was recently incorporated in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>'The merger will not lead to acquisition of market power and removal of an efficient competitor,' said the CTC.</p>
      <p>The deal might, however, still have to go through other regulatory approvals such as the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>It will also have to get shareholder approval.</p>
      <p>For the past few months, Meikles Limited has been running a cautionary statement advising shareholders of the impending deal.</p>
      <p>'Further to the cautionary statement published in the Press on February 22, 2019 and subsequent updates on March 20, 2019; April 12, 2019 and May 2, 2019, the directors of Meikles Limited wish to advise shareholders that discussion to sell certain of its hospitality assets are on-going.</p>
      <p>'The company will be seeking the approval of its shareholders for the proposed disposal at an extraordinary general meeting to be convened at a future date,' Meikles said in a statement two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Meikles Hotel, which is owned by the Moxon Family, through Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-listed entity Meikles Limited, is a legendary meeting place for international business executives, dignitaries, leisure travellers and celebrities.</p>
      <p>The hotel, which has been in existence for over 100 years, is the brainchild of Thomas Meikles who envisioned a commitment to the 'highest possible standard of service and product' - something that has become enshrined in the Meikles culture.</p>
      <p>It has always been an iconic landmark of the capital city Harare, one which has constantly and gracefully evolved through the colonial era of Rhodesia into modern-day Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Its position in the heart of the city has allowed its walls to bear witness to many events that have shaped the nation's past.</p>
      <p>The first parliament of the Colony of Southern Rhodesia met at Meikles Hotel in 1924. Since then leading African nationalists, royalty, Presidents and distinguished guests and celebrities from various nations around the world have met and stayed there.</p>
      <p>But the hotel, that Thomas Meikles, who died on February 8 1939, constructed, is set to change hands, after the Moxon family, which married into the Meikles family, decided to sale to Albwardy Investment, owned by Dubai billionaire, Ali Albwardy who founded his own empire in 1976.</p>
      <p>While the CTC did not give details on how much the deal is worth, parties familiar with the transaction said its worth US$20 million.</p>
      <p>Meikles Limited, under the hospitality business, also operates the Victora Falls Hotel in a joint venture arrangement with African Sun and also has a significant shareholding in the Cape Grace Hotel in Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
      <p>As at September 30, 2018, the hotels asset base was worth US$46,9 million while liabilities amounted to US$22 million.</p>
      <p>In terms of revenue, the hotel business made US$10,3 million for the half year to September 30, 2018 with EBITDA coming out at US$3,3 million.</p>
      <p>On its part, Albwardy Investment, with an annual turnover exceeding US$1 billion, operates in a number of business sectors ranging from food retailing, food distribution, construction, engineering, hospitality and hotel ownership.</p>
      <p>Headquartered in Dubai, Albwardy portfolio consists of over 30 highly diversified companies and employs over 5 000 multi-national, multi-lingual staff, supported by a network of global partners.</p>
      <p>Its current hotel interests consist of 16 properties on four continents.</p>
      <p>'The portfolio is a diverse mix of acquired, refurbished and newly built properties, with its success resting in branding the hotels and resorts with some of the most distinguished, renowned and best in class international hotel chains and operators,' reads a statement on its website.</p>
      <p>The Albwardy portfolio comprises of 1 300 rooms, with a further 400 under development. It employs over 2 500 staff with an additional 1 000 jobs created on our project sites. Among other hotel brands, it runs the Four Seasons Hotel across countries including South Africa, Seychelles and Argentina.</p>
      <p>In addition to hotels, Albwardy hospitality also includes investments in lifestyle assets within Dubai, namely The Desert Palm Polo Estate and Residences, Taste Kitchen and Pavilion foods restaurants.</p>
      <p>The hospitality business is headed by Zimbabwean Laurie Ward.</p>
      <p>Laurie worked in the accounting profession before joining Lonrho Africa in 1999, diversifying into the hospitality sector in 2006 until joining Albwardy Investment in 2016 as managing director of the group's growing hospitality sector and ongoing hotel development projects.</p>

      <title>Indian power giant eyes Zimbabwe</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ZIMBABWE'S efforts to resolve a crippling power shortage have received a major boost after India's largest power services company, NPTC Limited, expressed interest in building a 100-megawatt solar power plant in the country, a top Indian diplomat has said.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe's power deficit has seen some parts of the country going for more than 18 hours a day without electricity. The situation has negatively affected economic growth through subdued industrial, commercial and household activities.</p>
      <p>The country requires about 1 800MW at peak periods of demand, but is currently able to generate an average of 700MW due to drought and low water levels that have reduced hydropower generation at Kariba Dam.</p>
      <p>Hwange Power Station's capacity is also constrained due to old equipment.</p>
      <p>Currently, Zimbabwe is bridging the power supply deficit with imports from the region. However, this is no longer reliable as the regional utilities are also facing their own internal supply challenges. Shortage of foreign currency is also presenting its own fair share of constraints in importing electricity.</p>
      <p>Since the completion of Hwange Power Station in the mid-1980s, the country has seen very little investment in new generation capacity, but the Government has since licensed multiple power projects as it seeks self-sufficiency.</p>
      <p>On its part, the Government is also undertaking two major projects - the Hwange Power Station Units 7 and 8 to add 600MW to the national grid; and Batoka Gorge, which is being jointly implemented with Zambia. The 2 400MW to be generated from that project will be shared equally by the two neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Sunday Mail Business, Indian Ambassador to Zimbabwe Rungsung Masukui said the giant Indian firm wants to invest in Zimbabwe's power sector. Ambassador Masukui said a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)between the Zimbabwean Government and the Indian firm had already been signed.</p>
      <p>He added that several Indian firms were already operating in Zimbabwe. The include oil producers Surface Wilmar and Cangrow Trading, Varun Beverages and Splash Paints. The companies have maintained presence despite a tough operating environment.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Masukui said Indian companies' interest in Zimbabwe was also growing with the number increasing from seven in 2017 to 37 last year, while 25 registrations were recorded in the six months to June this year. He is expecting total registrations to exceed 50 by the end of this year.</p>
      <p>'NTPC Limited, a huge Indian company in the power sector, which is a parastatal in India, is also looking at investing in the solar sector through a 100-megawatt plant. They will be coming to explore the opportunity.</p>
      <p>'They have just signed an MoU (with the Government of Zimbabwe), but they will come and explore the possibility of building a solar power plant in Zimbabwe. NTPC Limited is one of the biggest parastatals in India. It produces about 60 000 megawatts,' Ambassador Masukui told The Sunday Mail Business.</p>
      <p>NTPC was formed in 1975 to accelerate power development in the Asian country and has established itself as a dominant power producer with presence in the entire power generation value chain. From fossil fuels, it has expanded into generating electricity via hydro, nuclear and renewable energy sources.</p>
      <p>The total installed capacity of the company is 57 106 watts (including joint venture stations). lt has 23 coal-based power plants, seven gas-based stations, two hydro-based stations and one wind -based station.</p>
      <p>Ten joint venture stations are coal based while 11 are solar PV projects.</p>
      <p>By 2032, non-fossil fuel based generation capacity shall make up nearly 30 percent of NTPC's portfolio.</p>
      <p>In October 2004, NTPC launched its Initial Public Offering (IPO) consisting of 5,25 percent as fresh issue and 5,25 percent as offer for sale by the government of India.</p>
      <p>In February 2013, the government of India further divested 9,5 percent shares through an OFS route.</p>
      <p>With this, GOI's holding in NTPC has reduced from 84,5 percent to 75 percent. The rest is held by institutional investors, banks and the public.</p>
      <p>India is the world's fifth biggest economy by nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>

      <title>Case of Football versus Gift Banda!</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The ZIFA Executive Committee hereby informs members of the football fraternity and the nation of the decision of the Executive Committee on the 16th of January 2019 to suspend/ ban Vice President Hon Gift Banda from taking part in any football activities with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>This is as a result of acts and/or omissions on his part which constitute serious breaches of the ZIFA constitution as well as its rules and regulations as defined by Articles 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 under document 3, 'Rules relating to misconduct and disciplinary proceeding' of the ZIFA rules and regulations. The suspension is effective until the next ZIFA Congress 'where it may be varied or otherwise confirmed by the Congress'.</p>
      <p>The Association may, however, institute further disciplinary proceedings before Congress to further ventilate on the very serious charges that he is facing and in accordance with its statutes.</p>
      <p>The following constitute Honourable Banda's alleged transgressions and misconduct: Honourable Banda illegally and unilaterally without authority of the Board, unconstitutionally usurped the powers of the Executive Committee as enshrined in section 34 (k) of the ZIFA Constitution that delegate the sole responsibility of appointing National Team Coaches and other technical staff to the ZIFA Executive Committee and not individuals.</p>
      <p>He illegally, unconstitutionally and against the ZIFA Rules and regulations (document 2, 'regulations on the allocation of functions to standing committees Article 2.11') again without authority, usurped powers of the Technical development standing committee whose role is to among other things recommend coaches, instructors and trainers to the Executive Committee thus bringing confusion, disorder and chaos to the smooth administration of our game.</p>
      <p>Honourable Banda wilfully misrepresented, lied and misled the public, stakeholders and the world during his press statements that the ZIFA executive Committee made the decision to fire coaches and made new appointments fully knowing that to be untrue thus causing disaffection on the Board, its Councillors, the public, the National Team, Coaches and stakeholders.</p>
      <p>By so doing he brought our game and the Association into disrepute at a time the Association is busy cleansing itself of all ill manners and attempting to attract corporate sponsorship. His utterances were widely circulated in both mainstream and social media and attracted a backlash on the Board on a decision it never reached.</p>
      <p>Through his actions of gross misconduct, he destabilised the team, lowered the morale at a time the team is just one game away from qualifying for the next AFCON edition and in so doing that would have negatively impacted on the preparations of the team and hence its ultimate performance .</p>
      <p>Honourable Banda caused a publication of a falsehood that the Head Coach of the Zimbabwe Men Senior National Team Sunday Chidzambga was the architect or agreed to change his backroom staff when he knew this was entirely false as the coach was happy to work with his team without any changes.</p>
      <p>He abrogated himself the powers he does not have by appointing support staff to national teams in breach of Article 34 (a) of the ZIFA constitution.</p>
      <p>In light of these very serious breaches, the ZIFA Executive Board has after a robust and extensive debate on the matter arrived at the decision of suspending/banning Honourable Gift Banda from all football related activities and his current position in the executive Committee with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>The Board has taken this route to show the entire world that it is serious about constitutionalism and the rule book.</p>
      <p>Further the Board's mandate as given to them by the esteemed assembly members is to grow our game and to adhere to the constitution.</p>

      <title>Follow the money</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>College graduation speeches come in all lengths and styles. Some are truly remarkable; most, however, are instantly forgettable even when they're being delivered by a well-known celebrity. One thing you can almost always count on hearing in every such oration is some version of this supposed wisdom: 'Follow your dream, because money can't make you happy.'</p>
      <p>But that wisdom is not always widely accepted among new graduands. Financial writer Michael Schramm, himself a college student, has a real problem with that advice.</p>
      <p>His critique of that adage in Money Magazine provides great food for thought as one college class enters the job market laden with student debt, and another ponders how best to invest their time and effort over the next four years.</p>
      <p>Can money buy happiness?</p>
      <p>Mr Schramm says the suggestion that money doesn't buy happiness is, 'a half-truth at best, a lie at worst.' In his personal experience, money and happiness are closely tied.</p>
      <p>Mr Schramm grew up in a household where home foreclosure was a real threat, a gaping hole in the roof went unrepaired, and the smallest food purchase could result in a screaming, stressful argument over money.</p>
      <p>'When bills arrived that couldn't be paid, money became a monster that tormented me,' Mr Schramm says.</p>
      <p>All that changed for Mr Schramm when he earned both a college scholarship and an allowance that allowed him to meet his basic needs. He felt anxiety wash away and was able to focus on things other than money, which he came to view as a friend, not a monster.</p>
      <p>'Simply put, more money did buy me happiness.'</p>
      <p>Measuring the link between money and happiness</p>
      <p>Mr Schramm's argument is more than anecdotal. He cites recent studies that indicate a connection between happiness and income - up to a point.</p>
      <p>Negative emotions decrease at a steady rate until income reaches about US$80 000, according to a June 2016 paper from Case Western Reserve University.</p>
      <p>Those negative feelings start to drop further as income nears US$200 000.</p>
      <p>A worldwide study by the University of Michigan found that income and well-being consistently rise together.</p>
      <p>Yet students are still bombarded with the message that striving to make a good living puts one at risk of living a dull, colourless life. Mr Schramm thinks that's a dangerous mindset.</p>
      <p>He cautions students and job seekers to instead seek a realistic balance between fulfilment and income.</p>
      <p>Further, he urges graduates to think carefully before pursuing a dream or passion that will leave them struggling with their bills over the long term.</p>
      <p>'Enjoying your work certainly increases your happiness, but that will be mitigated if your passions can't pay for food, water, shelter and utilities - if you can't put money in a savings account . . . if the occasional splurge is entirely outside your reach.'</p>
      <p>While passion pursuits may be emotionally rewarding, they could leave students with a gap in their financial plan if they're unable to manage a financial emergency or plan for larger investments, such as the purchase of a home.</p>
      <p>The takeaway: Focus on achieving both in equal measure</p>
      <p>He Schramm suggests students research job prospects and salaries in their dream profession and honestly assess whether they can live a decent life on that income.</p>
      <p>If not, he suggests, they might consider some sort of compromise.</p>
      <p>For example, a new grad uate in computer sciences with a passion for helping the poor could volunteer to oversee an anti-poverty group's information systems.</p>
      <p>This type of arrangement allows them to enjoy the best of both worlds, to a degree.</p>
      <p>'It may not seem as fulfilling as following your dreams, but here's the calculated truth: It will provide happiness.' - The Balance (Online)</p>

      <title>Editorial Comment: The economic war is winnable</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>With only two months left for the Transitional Stabilisation Programme (TSP) to run its full 27-month course, it is fair to say the bridging economic blueprint has done precisely the job that it was initially set out to accomplish - to stabilise the economy.</p>
      <p>But the word stability can be a misleadingly generic term.</p>
      <p>For an ordinary Zimbabwean, for whom the programme was intended in the first place, the only welcome stability that would be appreciated is the assurance that their hard-earned money is not eroded wily nilly, and retains real and full value that not only has demonstrable purchasing power, but can be a store of value as well.</p>
      <p>It means relatively stable prices of basic commodities over reasonably longer periods of time that makes budgeting realistic. And most importantly, it means the productive farmer and miner is paid a just reward for their sweat and are able to produce even more.</p>
      <p>This is exactly what has been obtaining on the ground since the introduction of the foreign currency auction system on June 23.</p>
      <p>While it is tempting to attribute the current stability solely on the auction system, this, however, is not the case.</p>
      <p>What is presently happening is the overall result of bold, assertive, pragmatic and targeted policies that began well before October 2018.</p>
      <p>It began with the strict observance of the public finance management system through discipline in handling public finances and being accountable.</p>
      <p>It began with the currency reforms which, because of the upheavals they caused in the market, were naively resisted by some quarters, including restoring discipline in financial markets, particularly in the mobile money services sector.</p>
      <p>While these interventions attracted an avalanche of criticism, most of it unfair and ill-advised, the chatter has since died down as success has become notable.</p>
      <p>As President Mnangagwa has often said, leadership is not about taking people where they want but where they ought to be.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, the reforms came with a considerable amount of pain.</p>
      <p>In fact, they came with a lot of pain.</p>
      <p>It was indeed the chemotherapy that was badly needed to treat the cancerous growth in the economy. To overcome, in unfortunate succession, the deleterious impact of Cyclone Idai, the worst drought in Sub-Saharan Africa in four decades, and dealing with the fallout from Covid-19 while at the same time keeping the population fed, including undertaking massive infrastructure programmes in roads, dams, etcetera, particularly even without the pretence of support from international finance institutions, is nothing short of an almost miraculous feat.</p>
      <p>Obviously, we cannot forget the extra burden of the two-decade-old sanctions.</p>
      <p>All this was made possible by the ability to plan, and to plan well.</p>
      <p>The 2021 Budget, which will naturally feed off the first five-year National Development Plan (NDP) (2021-2025), is crucially important in consolidating the gains made thus far and positioning the country for economic take-off.</p>
      <p>The 2021 pre-budget paper, which was launched by Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube on Friday, is already encouraging.</p>
      <p>Running under the theme 'Building Resilience and Recovery Post Covid-19', the paper envisages the economy will grow by 7,4 percent next year after a forecast 4,5 percent decline this year.</p>
      <p>The performance is premised on growth in manufacturing, agriculture and mining of 6,4 percent, 11,3 percent and 11 percent respectively.</p>
      <p>This obviously comes with increased economy activity and, by extension, jobs.</p>
      <p>It is quite apparent that the solution to sustainably growing the local economy lies in three things - production, production and production.</p>
      <p>This is the silver bullet that can change the vicious circle of low production, waning economic activity, foreign currency shortages and joblessness into a virtuous circle of high production, burgeoning economic activity and decent jobs.</p>
      <p>Successor economic plans, including the 2021 Budget, should therefore consolidate and build on the solid foundations that have been created so far.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the determined and sterling work by Government, this year the country will be harvesting an estimated nine months' supply of wheat, which will not only save the country a fortune, but guarantee affordable bread supplies.</p>
      <p>It will put more money in farmers' pockets. Suffice to say, it becomes urgent to come up with an effective plan to build on this remarkable progress to decisively eliminate wheat imports.</p>
      <p>Similar plans are required for maize and many other crops that the country can ordinarily grow for itself.</p>
      <p>Quite clearly, import substitution would mean more raw materials for industry and foreign currency savings, which ultimately would 'build resilience' of the Zimbabwe dollar. But this would mean Treasury would have to support the resuscitation of irrigation infrastructure around the country through leveraging on local companies that are able to do the job.</p>
      <p>There is need to plug the costly leakages of valuable minerals, particularly gold, in the mining sector to maximise foreign currency generation and build local reserves.</p>
      <p>That the country could be losing more than US$100 million of gold every month should be a serious cause for concern.</p>
      <p>However, most encouragingly, various Government projects are beginning to have a positively telling effect for industry.</p>
      <p>Reports on Masimba Construction's big order book owing to ongoing civil construction works around the country, including reports of recovering volumes at cement manufacturers, among others, clearly show the green shoots of recovery and growth.</p>
      <p>All that Zimbabwe needs to do is to double down on reforms. The first battle has been won and the war is winnable.</p>

      <title>Mthuli needs to work his magic on inflation</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ECONOMIC analysts expect Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube to announce new measures to contain and bring Zimbabwe's galloping inflation under control when he presents his midterm fiscal policy review statement in a fortnight, now that he is done with major policy changes.</p>
      <p>While meeting church leaders to apprise them of recent currency changes at the request of First Lady Auxilia Mnangagwa on Tuesday last week, Minister Ncube said he will present his midterm fiscal policy review statement in two weeks.</p>
      <p>With inflationary pressures continuing to mount, economic analysts said it was critical for fiscal authorities to continue containing expenditure within confines of Treasury's revenue envelope to avoid tipping the economy into hyperinflation mode.</p>
      <p>Arguably, Minister Ncube's biggest palace coup in rebalancing Zimbabwe's economy has been the ability to put Government finances in order, the first in a long time that this has happened in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>The Government is now running recurrent primary budget surplus and has halted money-printing, which led to hyperinflation in 2008.</p>
      <p>In a bid to discourage speculative borrowing, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last month raised its overnight lending rate to 50 percent to protect the local currency after ending a decade of dollarisation.</p>
      <p>This, together with the reintroduction of local currency and banning of the multi-currency, in place for slightly over a decade, will also give the central bank a full range of instruments and latitude to defend the value of local currency and stymie inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>Economist and former Bulawayo South parliamentarian Eddie Cross concurred when saying that Treasury has registered huge success on the fiscal front through 'the elimination of the fiscal deficit, which has been the main source of our macro-economic woes.'</p>
      <p>Analysts also agree that any supplementary funding requirements should, at most, be capped below 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to avoid potential risk of fuelling money supply growth into unproductive sectors which could prolong the episode of high inflation.</p>
      <p>There also is general consensus among economists that Zimbabwe's success in bringing inflation under control heavily depends on effectiveness of measures to ensure exchange rate stability, which has been the largest source of inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>'The chances of falling into hyperinflation are real now. The real reason why there has been such inflation is that the interbank market (for trading of foreign currency) has not been working to the maximum.</p>
      <p>'Authorities need to put more policies and build more confidence to get the banks and other players to start trading on the market,' he said.</p>
      <p>Minister Ncube, in his Budget Review Statement, is expected to pronounce concrete measures to counter inflationary pressures and keep inflation under check.</p>
      <p>The minister has, however, indicated that Zimbabweans should not expect any further seismic policy shifts following full re-introduction of the Zimbabwe dollar, with the focus now shifting towards growing the economy.</p>
      <p>Soaring food prices and other basic commodities since September 2018 pushed Zimbabwe's annual inflation to post dollarisation high of 175,66 percent last month, up from 97,85 percent in May, according to the latest data from the Zimbabwe National Statistical Agency.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe, which in February 2014 entered deflation before returning to above sub-zero levels after 29 months, saw massive inflation take off in October last year when the rate jumped to 20,85 percent from 5,39 percent.</p>
      <p>The biggest pain of sustained inflationary spike has largely been the fact that salaries have continued to significantly lag behind price increases, in fact, incomes have remained stagnant to a very large extend.</p>
      <p>Inflationary pressures largely emanated from the policy announcement related to currency reforms, which began in October last year and started with directive for the separation of Foreign Currency Account Nostros and the Real Times Gross Settlement accounts.</p>
      <p>Along the way, Government announced the Transitional Stabilisation Programme in October 2018, which entailed a number of targeted reforms, introduced the 2 percent intermediated money transfer tax (October 2019), national budget that had inflationary elements (November 2018), partial liberalisation of fuel (January 2019), exchange liberalisation (February 2019) and full liberalisation of fuel procurement in May this year.</p>
      <p>The other major move was abolishment of 1:1 fixed exchange rate after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe introduced the interbank market, which initially saw some prices creep up before they started falling.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Government finally announced that the US dollar, South African rand, Botswana pula and other foreign currencies were no longer legal tender in Zimbabwe, effectively abandoning the multi-currency regime, which Zimbabwe adopted in 2009 when hyperinflation rendered the Zimbabwean dollar worthless.</p>
      <p>The move also averted the country from plunging into full re-dollarisation when the economy did not have enough US dollars to support this. The continued rapid depreciation of the local currency against the US dollar had seen most businesses preferring to quote prices in US dollars in a country where the majority are paid RTGS dollars.</p>
      <p>Minister Ncube said he was happy that the Government had moved 'quite fast' on the issue of major currency reforms, as further delays would have prolonged market volatility and uncertainty, but essentially, this marked the end of major policy changes.</p>
      <p>Notably, Reserve Bank Governor Dr Mangudya has on a number of occasions rightly noted that while a lot of appropriate interventions have been adopted, positive mark response has proved difficult to come by due to crisis of confidence, as people keep looking back to the miserable experiences of the past and hyper-inflationary era, which lasted until 2008.</p>
      <p>And Minister Ncube has pledged to keep hammering on the measures to restore confidence in the economy and Government through sound policies and transparency in economic management.</p>
      <p>Action on currency was critical given that the dollar crunch in Zimbabwe was now unsettling prices, because as demand for the greenback grew and the exchange rates rose, they put inflation under pressure.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, economists said now that the major currency reforms were complete, the biggest fiscal incentive expected from the Government was to bring down inflation.</p>
      <p>Minister Ncube said the Government's national budget was now posting regular surplus, specifically over the last six months.</p>
      <p>'Indeed the biggest fiscal incentive that the fiscal authorities can offer to industry and the economy at large to stimulate economic growth and productivity…is the commitment to bring down inflation.</p>
      <p>'This will allow industry to preserve capital, while the households will be able to conserve their earnings and provide a sustainable market for goods and services produced in the economy.'</p>
      <p>Economist Dr Gift Mugano said the high inflation levels the country was currently experiencing resulted from 'policy shocks' related to currency and other economy wide key reforms.</p>
      <p>'We do not want more surprises,' economist Dr Gift Mugano said in an interview. From a policy perspective I think we did not do right in that we were making piece meal announcements, month in month out,' he said.</p>
      <p>'In every announcement there is a reaction from the market and in many cases the reaction is adverse and it's also excessive in that people go beyond a limit because they are even responding through (massive) price adjustments.</p>
      <p>'Our shock absorbers are finished and what we now want to hear from the minister (of Finance) are measures to stimulate growth. Firstly, we anticipate the minister to raise tax bands for PAYE so that people earning low salaries pay little or no taxes at all.</p>
      <p>'This will stimulate spending and at the same time boost demand. We do not want to get into a trap of low aggregate demand which might take us into recession,' Dr Mugano added.</p>
      <p>These sentiments were shared by Dairibord Holdings group chief executive Anthony Mandiwanza who said 'once the disposable income is compressed due to high inflation, then aggregate demand for goods is reduced.'</p>
      <p>Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries president Henry Ruzvidzo weighed in saying that the high inflation over the past few months had created distortions in the market, including loss of purchasing power for the Zimbabwean consumers.</p>
      <p>'Some stability is now evident and will allow for the establishment of a new equilibrium for the economy and restoration of aggregate demand.'</p>
      <p>Minister Ncube has already indicated that he will review tax free thresholds to improve disposable incomes. 'What we will be doing is to review upwards the thresholds for those paying income tax and PAYE…to give relief to those earning below the poverty datum line because of the increase in inflation,' said the Minister.</p>
      <p>Dr Mugano said after the currency reforms Government should now move towards production enhancement. This, he said, should be in the form of tax breaks and tax exemptions.</p>
      <p>'The currency is the victim of supply side bottlenecks. It is therefore important the minister announces supply side enhancing policies,' said Dr Mugano.</p>
      <p>Importantly, there is a technical explanation to what will also happen to inflation come September, that inflation will fall sharply but not to levels most may be comfortable with, as the period will see huge drop in the gap between indices for the 2018 and 2019, given that inflation last year started rising from a very low base.</p>

      <title>Parlours tussle over body</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>AWAY from the mourning that was taking place nationwide and beyond Zimbabwe's borders - behind the scenes a war over custody of the body of the late national hero, Dr Oliver Mtukudzi, was raging.</p>
      <p>Dr Mtukudzi had a policy with Nyaradzo Funeral Services, which upon his death quickly moved in to prepare the body for its final journey.</p>
      <p>However, the moment Dr Mtukudzi was declared a National Hero, the highest honour that can be conferred on an individual in Zimbabwe, it meant that certain protocol had to be followed.</p>
      <p>Without wasting time, Government activated its systems through the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. The funeral services company which has a contract for burial of national heroes in Zimbabwe is Doves.</p>
      <p>As is the norm, Doves instituted proceedings for a handover-takeover with Nyaradzo.</p>
      <p>According to stipulations regulating burial of National Heroes, the company that handles the body of a hero needs its staff to have security clearance and for everyone to be bound by a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
      <p>Phone calls were made between the two companies, times were agreed and a meeting place for the handover-takeover set. However, all hell broke loose when staff from Doves arrived at Nyaradzo's Willowvale morgue to collect the body of Dr Mtukudzi.</p>
      <p>According to an eye witness, tempers flared as Philip Mataranyika, the chief executive officer of the Nyaradzo Group of Companies blocked the process, telling hapless Doves' staff that there was no way they would pick up the body from Nyaradzo. Even the arrival of the Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs Melusi Matshiya did not help matters as Mataranyika remained defiant.</p>
      <p>The insistence by Nyaradzo Funeral Services to continue handling the body without being compliant with the above-mentioned prerequisites was somewhat in contravention of the venerated treatment associated with the burial of National Heroes or Heroines.</p>
      <p>'There was a heated exchange between Mataranyika and the Perm Sec (Matshiya). The Government official tried to explain to Mataranyika that once a person has been declared a National Hero - it meant that the State was taking over but he wouldn't listen,' said our source, who witnessed the drama.</p>
      <p>'There is now a spin that Mataranyika drove that hearse out of respect for Tuku but the truth is that he was actually guarding the body of the singer. He took it upon himself to be the driver, guard and undertaker. He even threatened to take legal action over the matter. It is a good thing that Government, to avoid further drama, gave in and let Nyaradzo bury Mtukudzi,' added the source.</p>
      <p>The issue did not, however, end there. Throughout the funeral proceedings, especially in Harare, Doves continued to shadow Nyaradzo just in case the company was asked by the Government to take over the funeral at the last minute.</p>
      <p>The convoy even had two caskets, one with the body inside a Nyaradzo hearse and another carried by a Doves vehicle.</p>
      <p>There was even confusion at the National Sports Stadium as to which car actually carried the body of the late national hero.</p>
      <p>According to an official from the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, the position of Government was that Doves understands the protocol and they meet all the requirements for such high profile burials. Negotiations are said to have continued behind the scenes as Government officials hoped to convince Mataranyika to handover the body to avoid logistical nightmares and protocol breakdown. These yielded nothing.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail Society contacted the Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Matshiya, who refused to delve into the details of what really transpired saying,</p>
      <p>'It's not within our culture to cause acrimony or incite controversy during and after the interment of the deceased.'</p>
      <p>Efforts to get a comment from Nyaradzo Funeral Services through their PR office or Mataranyika directly were fruitless by the time of going to print. Doves officials said they were not entertaining the media.</p>

      <title>Domestic tourism: Launchpad after Covid-19</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Enhancing the tourism sector's ability to attract domestic tourists is part of a strategy that is being worked on by Government to ensure recovery after the coronavirus has been contained.</p>
      <p>Tourism and related businesses are the hardest hit by the pandemic.</p>
      <p>Overall, the strategy will look at the competitiveness of local tourism facilities, including on pricing.</p>
      <p>Policymakers are mulling waiving value added tax (VAT) for tourism products and services.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a recent virtual Economic Outlook Symposium hosted by Global Renaissance Investments, Environment, Climate, Tourism and Hospitality Industry Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu said domestic tourism was a low-hanging fruit for the sector, especially at a time when regional and global travel is restricted.</p>
      <p>It is believed it will take time for the situation to normalise.</p>
      <p>'Support of domestic tourism offers the biggest opportunity for the recovery of the sector. We are looking at competitiveness of our tourism facilities for the local market.</p>
      <p>'We want to know what makes our hotels expensive as well as waiving VAT on accommodation and other activities.</p>
      <p>'As it is now, we are not yet at a time when people want to travel abroad as they are still worried about the pandemic. The low-hanging fruit is domestic tourism under this scenario. So we are working on a strategy that should promote domestic tourism.</p>
      <p>'This sector plays a critical role to our economy and needs to be supported,' he noted.</p>
      <p>Minister Ndlovu acknowledged the sector was already bleeding due to effects of the pandemic and needed all the support from stakeholders for quick recovery.</p>
      <p>Hotel occupancies have been progressively dropping since the beginning of the year. In February, average occupancies were at 28 percent before falling to 10 percent in March and below 5 percent in April.</p>
      <p>Some hospitality groups have already closed their facilities. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the sector suffered a 11 percent decline partly because of misinformation by some international media that the Victoria Falls were drying up.</p>
      <p>'Figures show that 2018 was a good year and the sector contributed about 11 percent to total GDP, but fell to about 8 percent in 2019. We had anticipated growth this year but the pandemic has strained the sector,' said Minister Ndlovu.</p>
      <p>Among other interventions being put in place for the sector's recovery include operationalising the tourism revolving fund with a capital injection of $20 million, as well as commitment from Government to pay all its dues to the sector for services rendered in 2019.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the same platform, economist Mr Eddie Cross highlighted the sector's critical role to economic growth.</p>
      <p>'Tourism will be hardest hit but we have the resources, let us prepare these for the return of tourists, because they are coming back.</p>
      <p>'This is the time to revamp our facilities in Victoria Falls, Nyanga and other destinations to ensure the sector is ready for reopening,' he said.</p>
      <p>Government had identified tourism as one of the sectors to drive economic growth this year, but prospects were dampened by the pandemic.</p>
      <p>The World Bank already projects a decline in GDP for the Sub-Saharan Africa region on the back of low agriculture production, as well as declines in tourism due to travel restrictions.</p>
      <p>A recent study by the African Union shows that Africa's tourism and aviation sectors are already reeling from the impact of Covid-19, with hotels laying off workers and travel agencies shutting down.</p>
      <p>The study shows that under the average scenario, the tourism and travel sectors in Africa could lose at least US$50 billion, and two million direct and indirect jobs.</p>
      <p>Top African airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, EgyptAir and Kenya Airways will be affected by travel restrictions across the world.</p>
      <p>According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Africa's air transport industry contributes up to US$55,8 billion, which is 2,6 percent of Africa's GDP and supports 6,2 million jobs.</p>
      <p>By March 11, African airlines had lost US$4,4 billion in revenue.</p>

      <title>Call for more investment in junior taekwondo</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>ZIMBABWEAN taekwondo has the potential to scale greater heights on the international scene if more investment is put into junior development, a school sports director has said.</p>
      <p>There's a general belief that a lot of taekwondo talent goes untapped in schools, with a number of potential future champions abandoning the sport once they leave formal education.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the sidelines of a schools taekwondo competition at Correspondence Learning Centre (CLC) in Belvedere, Harare, the school's sports director Victor Muzadzi called for a more vigilant junior development programs to enable the country to realise its full potential in the sport</p>
      <p>CLC is one of the leading taekwondo schools, having raked a number of medals at various competitions in Southern Africa.</p>
      <p>They achieved another milestone following their invitation to the Africa Cup in Tanzania in October.</p>
      <p>'We are showcasing what the kids can do in taekwondo, even from elementary education level right up to Upper Six.</p>
      <p>'We train these juniors as much as we can. We teach them the basics and also make them aware that taekwondo is a fruitful sport if pursued diligently,' said Muzadzi.</p>
      <p>'We select our teams for SADC competitions from these schools' inter-house competitions. Every year, we usually go for tournaments in Durban, South Africa.</p>
      <p>'This year we also going to the Africa Cup in Tanzania. I think schools are actually doing a lot in terms of taekwondo.</p>
      <p>'We have been nurturing talent in terms of taekwondo,' said Muzadzi.</p>
      <p>According to the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF), the international governing body for the sport, taekwondo has become a global sport that has gained an international reputation. lt stands among the official games at the Olympics.</p>
      <p>It is one of the most systematic and scientific forms of Korean traditional martial arts.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe regularly sends taekwondo participants to the African Games. At the 2015 edition held in Congo Brazzaville, the country was represented by 10 athletes.</p>
      <p>Phineus Dzingi, Vusa Ncube, Brian Nduna, Donald Guvheya, Basil Madanha, Tedius Chingosho, Beton Boba, Admire Tshitshiliza, Neville Bhunu and Theresa Masocha were selected to represent Zimbabwe at the 2015 games.</p>
      <p>The country will send three athletes for the 2019 African Games in Morocco next month. The games are also serving as the qualifiers for the 2020 Olympics in Japan.</p>
      <p>Kudzai Chimombe, Spencer Kondo and Lazarus Maringehosi are part of Team Zimbabwe which was announced by the Sport and Recreation Commission last Friday.</p>

      <title>Lessons from Cyclone Idai</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>What lessons can be drawn from Cyclone Idai, in terms of disaster preparedness and responsiveness?</p>
      <p>Disaster management experts say there should be a proper mitigation strategy and proper communication channels to reduce the impact and risk of hazard through proactive measures before an emergency or disaster occurs to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and missing people.</p>
      <p>For its part, the Meteorological Service Department (MSD) raised alarm bells two weeks before the tropical cyclone hit Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Through its director, Mr Tichaona Zinyemba, the meteorological department warned that the cyclone would 'generate torrential rains and exceedingly strong winds, resulting in flooding and destruction of infrastructure along its path'.</p>
      <p>But the million-dollar question remains; was enough done to get the message to the people in the remotest parts of the affected areas? What should have been done to make sure information reached the most in the shortest possible time?</p>
      <p>Dr Maynard Karongo, an emergency response specialist, said State resources could have been used to move people to safety before the cyclone struck and with the unavailability of camps, displaced people could have been sent to relatives in less affected areas.</p>
      <p>'Public and private property could have been used as temporary transit camps - such as the Chimanimani Hotel, which led by example by taking in about 200 families.</p>
      <p>'Cyclone Idai cannot be equated to any other strong winds and heavy rains where the Civil Protection Unit just broadcast messages of warning and cautions through print and electronic media,' he said.</p>
      <p>'Understanding that this was forecast as a deadly cyclone, developing into a Category 3 and 4 weather phenomenon, with winds of up to 175 km/h, the Civil Protection Unit could have done better in engaging relevant stakeholders and proposing relocation of people ahead of time.</p>
      <p>'A mere warning and red alert caution to poverty-stricken rural dwellers is not sufficient for them to mobilise themselves to vacate the areas.'</p>
      <p>The chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, Honourable Miriam Chikukwa, said the budget allocated to the Civil Protection Unit was not enough for them to deal with such a disaster.</p>
      <p>'The budget that was allocated to the CPU was not enough and I hope Government will re-look into that, had there been enough resources the department would have performed better than they did in terms of communication and evacuation,' she said.</p>
      <p>She also urged everyone contributing towards the disaster to continue to assist and implored all concerned that there should be a standing budget, should a recurrence of a disaster of this magnitude occur.</p>
      <p>Honourable Chikukwa added: 'We have learnt a lot from the cyclone as a country, people can unite from political persuasions and I urge Zimbabweans to continue with that spirit of working above politics.'</p>
      <p>Dr Karongo added that communities have a central role in the long and short-term of disaster management.</p>
      <p>'The focus of attention in disaster management must be the local community. Disaster risk or vulnerability reduction is the foundation of community-based disaster management, of which disaster risk reduction encompasses disaster preparedness with a properly functioning Civil Protection Unit,' he said.</p>
      <p>He added that communities are always eager to protect themselves from risks through community-based disaster preparedness and mitigation and this is only possible when they are taught emergency responses.</p>
      <p>Efforts to get a comment from the Civil Protection Unit were unsuccessful as some of the numbers went unanswered and some were not reachable.</p>

    <text>
      <p>ZIMBABWE Stock Exchange-listed Fidelity Life Assurance says the group is firmly set on sustainable growth path in light of stellar performance in the first half of 2018.</p>
      <p>In an interview, chief executive Mr Reuben Java said the positive performance demonstrated the group was headed in the right direction.</p>
      <p>H1 financial performance showed an increase in revenue largely attributed to sale of residential stands ($12 million out of $25,8 million). There has been growth in the insurance business as well.</p>
      <p>Gross written premiums increased 43 percent compared to the prior period, driven by aggressive new business acquisition, particularly in the employee benefits segment.</p>
      <p>'Overall, the group's performance was very pleasing, with a 97 percent increase in revenue recognised in the half year to June 30, 2018 compared to the half year to June 30, 2017.</p>
      <p>'The group closed its half-year ahead of the same period in 2017, with a profit before tax of US$3,7 million compared to US$2,4 million for the period to June 30, 2017. The performance shows the early fruits of the Group's efforts to rebuild its position in the market,' Mr Java said.</p>
      <p>Mr Java said the micro-finance subsidiary continued to excel, with its loan book growing organically and from new lines of credit.</p>
      <p>The unit posted a profit before tax of US$1,3 million, 52 percent higher than in the comparative half year, on the back of revenue growth and cost management.</p>
      <p>'The strategy that we laid out at the start of 2018 is starting to bear fruit. We are focusing on three main strategic pillars; these are aggressive growth, brand repositioning and sound corporate governance,' said Mr Java.</p>
      <p>He said Vanguard Life Assurance, Fidelity Life's subsidiary in Malawi, had growing importance as it provided diversification.</p>
      <p>The board and new management at Fidelity Life have been strengthening the group's corporate governance structures.</p>
      <p>'The nature of our business is that we sell promises which are not tangible; the value of these promises is grounded in the institutional framework that we build today to ensure that the promises we make, as much as is humanely possible will be delivered in future,' Mr Java said.</p>

      <title>Tsingshan's US$1bn steel plant on course</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Chinese firm Tsingshan Holdings Group's plans to build a US$1 billion stainless steel plant in Mvuma remain firmly on course amid indications that Zimbabwe's strategy to ramp up ferrochrome production is designed to also cater for the company's feedstock requirements.</p>
      <p>The company, one of the biggest producers of stainless steel products in the world, specialises in castings, steel bars, steel wires, steel plates and other products, which are mostly exported to South-East Asia.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan signed a US$1 billion outline agreement with Government in July last year, and intends to build a two million tonne-per-annum stainless steel plant in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>The firm will also mine a number of minerals needed for steel production.</p>
      <p>The Chinese company recently expanded its plans for the Zimbabwe steel plant to include a power plant and lithium extraction.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan is already undertaking resource evaluation for coal, chrome and nickel, which started in the second quarter of this year.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan's steel investment is part of the several multimillion-dollar deals that President Mnangagwa's administration has inked since coming into power in 2017. The projects are at various levels of implementation.</p>
      <p>Other projects include the US$4,2 billion platinum mining venture by Cypriot firm, Karo Resources, where exploration is already underway, with thousands of drills done on site. An aero-magnetic survey was concluded earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe's foreign policy under President Mnangagwa has shifted from focusing on political issues to emphasis on economic ones.</p>
      <p>The policy is designed in a way that aids Zimbabwe's economic recovery, facilitates growth, creates employment and encourages a climate that is conducive to attracting investors into the country.</p>
      <p>Government is working towards growing Zimbabwe's economy to middle-income level by 2030, a vision espoused by President Mnangagwa. Initially, Tsingshan intended to produce chrome, nickel, iron and coal.</p>
      <p>However, the fresh plans will see the company constructing a 600-megawatt power plant in two phases, as well as venture into lithium extraction.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan's investment is expected to create more than 2 000 jobs. It will promote technology transfer and generate billions from Zimbabwe's export proceeds.</p>
      <p>Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando recently said plans to increase ferrochrome production were on course.</p>
      <p>'Government signed an agreement with Tsingshan for the production of carbon steel. The main ingredients that go into carbon steel are ferrochrome, coke and iron ore.</p>
      <p>'For that stainless steel production to commence, we have to ramp up ferrochrome production, which is happening. That is why we have the 500 000 tonnes (target by 2023),' said Minister Chitando.</p>
      <p>He said Tsingshan's plans will also entail ramping up coke production, which is produced from coal, to facilitate the steel production.</p>
      <p>Minister Chitando said Zimbabwe's ferrochrome producers are currently churning out 500 000 annually.</p>
      <p>The planned ferrochrome production is expected to contribute towards Government's vision of growing exports from the mining sector to US$12 billion by 2023.</p>
      <p>Ferrochrome production, as a sub-sector, is anticipated to generate US$1 billion in export proceeds.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan's Afrochine has already embarked on expanding its furnace capacity to increase output.</p>
      <p>Prior to signing the stainless steel agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe, Tsingshan already had a footprint in Zimbabwe. Its unit, Afrochine, extracts chrome near Selous.</p>
      <p>Major ferrochrome producing entities in Zimbabwe include Gweru-based Jinan, Zimasco and ZimAlloys, which is set to resume production after years of dormancy due to financial challenges.</p>
      <p>Cumulatively, the companies produced 360 000 tonnes, but are expected to increase output to half a million by 2023, that is excluding the products that will come from Afrochine's expansion plans.</p>
      <p>Tsingshan's Afrochine produced 19 677 tonnes in 2018 and is expected to increase production capacity to 500 000 tonnes by 2023.</p>
      <p>The other key minerals that are expected to drive the vision for a U$12 billion mining industry include gold, diamond, coal, lithium.</p>
      <p>'The US$12 billion will be achieved, no question about that. The US$12 billion is made up of a target of 100 tonnes from gold, which will generate US$4 billion; platinum, which will generate US$3 billion; while chrome, nickel and steel will bring in US$1 billion. Coal and hydro-carbons will generate another US$1 billion, while diamonds will bring in US$1 billion. Lithium will generate US$500 million while the other minerals will bring in US$1,5 billion,' Minister Chitando said.</p>

    <text>
      <p>May's chief goal is to deliver Brexit before the EU parliamentary elections on May 23, giving her a fleeting chance of avoiding a permanent fracture in her beloved Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>The British parliament has said over and over again that it doesn't want the UK to leave the European Union without an exit deal.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night (last week) it made that binding in a vote that was won on a razor thin 313-312 margin.</p>
      <p>Even that (assuming it's okayed by the House of Lords) doesn't end all the risks of a no-deal Brexit.</p>
      <p>For one thing, the vote requires the government to seek an extension from Brussels, and that will have to be approved unanimously by 27 EU member states.</p>
      <p>The bloc's leaders still need to be convinced that they were delaying for a worthy reason; not just allowing the UK more time to wallow in its own political mire.</p>
      <p>There's also the matter of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.</p>
      <p>That's the key piece of legislation needed to implement any Brexit deal finally agreed by parliament.</p>
      <p>If Theresa May's government can reach some kind of accord with Jeremy Corbyn's opposition Labour Party in the coming days, she will try to rush it through.</p>
      <p>But given the acrimony in parliament, its success is not a given.</p>
      <p>May's Brexiter MPs - who make up a strong and noisy bloc in parliament - are already furious about her compromise talks with Corbyn, and the withdrawal bill contains plenty more to stoke the flames of their anger.</p>
      <p>It would give EU law that's reflected in the agreed deal primacy over UK law, for instance, and would grant ministers the right to make divorce payments to the EU, along with other sweeping powers.</p>
      <p>It's worth remembering too that getting a deal and the implementing legislation through parliament is merely the end of the beginning.</p>
      <p>That just pushes the UK over the Brexit line and into a transition period, during which the country would keep all the same access to the EU's markets but without any say in its institutions.</p>
      <p>After 'Brexit Day,' whenever that may be, the real fun starts: Britain and Brussels start negotiating the terms of their future relationship.</p>
      <p>What happens if they don't agree by the end of the transition deadline? Another cliff edge?</p>
      <p>And this all assumes that May and Corbyn - two leaders famed for their inability to compromise or shift position - agree on what deal will be presented to lawmakers for approval.</p>
      <p>May's overture to Corbyn was both desperate and clever.</p>
      <p>If he refused help and Britain crashed out with no deal, Labour's remain voters (crucial to its success in big cities) might decide he shared the blame.</p>
      <p>If the UK ended up in limbo, staying in the EU for a period or perhaps forever, the leave-voting constituencies in Labour's industrial heartlands would feel ignored.</p>
      <p>Despite all the differences, there is some alignment of interests between the two party leaders.</p>
      <p>Delivering Brexit has been May's central mission as prime minister, but Corbyn has long wanted it as well.</p>
      <p>His vision of a more interventionist, socialist Britain depends on being free from EU strictures on state aid and other policies.</p>
      <p>He too is skeptical about the merits of the free movement of European workers to Britain.</p>
      <p>But the common ground mustn't be overstated.</p>
      <p>May's chief goal is to deliver Brexit before the EU parliamentary elections on May 23, giving her a fleeting chance of avoiding a permanent fracture in her beloved Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>Corbyn's strategy is to keep both Labour's leavers and remainers happy, a coalition he must maintain in order to win the next general election.</p>
      <p>Neither side trusts the other, and you could hardly blame them given the stakes.</p>
      <p>Get it wrong and either side could end up splitting their own party, or their vote.</p>
      <p>Labour, in particular, worry that May or her party will renege on any deal.</p>
      <p>For their part, the Tories fear Corbyn will try to tie their hands in a future election by demanding new workers' rights and other guarantees.</p>
      <p>They are like two climbers who need each other to reach the summit, but who know there's only oxygen for one to make it down alive.</p>
      <p>As things stand, it looks like the cohesiveness of the Conservative Party is in greater peril.</p>
      <p>Corbyn would probably settle for a permanent customs union, which goes a long way to resolving the problem of how to keep the Irish border open.</p>
      <p>His party is also clamouring for a second referendum to put any agreed deal to a vote, and it's hard to see how he can agree to any plan that doesn't include that.</p>
      <p>The Tories were elected on a manifesto to take Britain out of the customs union and May has strongly opposed a second referendum, but she could be shifting her position on both.</p>
      <p>In a late-night TV interview on Wednesday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said a confirmatory referendum was 'perfectly credible.'</p>
      <p>His Brexiter colleagues will be apoplectic about that idea, but he's right.</p>
      <p>Such a vote would give the British public a clear choice between what they already have (EU membership) and whatever deal Parliament approves.</p>
      <p>There would be no guesswork or interpretation required, which was the problem with the simplistic original 'in-out' vote, where 'out' meant different things to different people.</p>
      <p>Should May and Corbyn make progress, the UK would have to ask the EU for a long extension, with the possibility of a break clause once the UK approves a deal.</p>
      <p>The country would probably have to participate in those imminent European Parliament elections.</p>
      <p>Would the Conservative Party survive that degree of compromise from their leader?</p>
      <p>It's entirely possible that the next campaign for lifelong euroskeptics, the 'Great Brexit Betrayal,' began in earnest on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>For now, the strain on Britain's governing stability from following a compromise path will be enormous.</p>
      <p>How would legislation get passed by a parliament with no working majority, and where the ruling party is in open warfare with its leader?</p>
      <p>It's hard to imagine May remaining beyond the agreement of the deal, or the country avoiding fresh elections.</p>
      <p>Maybe a fracturing of the two-party system is needed to better navigate the deep divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>A no-deal outcome is now ruled out (as far as it can be without the EU's say so).</p>
      <p>But the future of Brexit is no clearer, even if its delivery has ironically ended up in the hands of Corbyn and Brussels rather than the party that has obsessed about this subject for decades.</p>
      <p>'When you are climbing at high altitudes, life can get pretty miserable,' said the great climber Edmund Hillary.</p>
      <p>Doesn't Theresa May just know it.</p>

      <title>AFM divorce sealed</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Acting Religious Affairs Editor</p>
      <p>Leadership structures in Apostolic Faith Mission in Zimbabwe (AFM)'s two camps are already being set up as moves are made to seal the divorce between church president Dr Aspher Madziire's camp and that of deputy president Reverend Cosam Chiyangwa.</p>
      <p>The two groups are holding parallel elections to choose new leadership.</p>
      <p>Dr Madziire and Rev Chiyangwa locked horns over reforms to amend the church constitution.</p>
      <p>Last week, The Sunday Mail Society gathered that Dr Madziire's group is known as the 'Reform AFM' while Rev Chiyangwa's camp is referred to as the 'Original AFM'.</p>
      <p>It is said Rev Chiyangwa's camp is sticking to the original constitution of the church.</p>
      <p>Rev Chiyangwa's team held provincial elections on the 6th and 13th of October 2018 to choose new leadership in preparation for national executive elections on Saturday while on the other hand, Dr Madziire's camp will hold polls on December 31, 2018.</p>
      <p>In a notice dated October 11, 2018, the interim general secretary in the 'Original AFM', Dr Nathan Nhira said an extraordinary workers council will be held at Rufaro conference centre in Chatsworth on October 20, 2018.</p>
      <p>A total of 320 delegates will form an electoral college to elect the church's new leadership on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Part of the agenda of the meeting is to elect national leadership.</p>
      <p>Rev Chiyangwa's spokesman, Rev Togara Mapingure said the majority of assemblies are aligned to their group. He claimed 276 assemblies are behind them, against the 87 that are in Dr Madziire's corner.</p>
      <p>He said a total of 762 ordained pastors, out of 855, are rallying behind Rev Chiyangwa.</p>
      <p>Rev Mapingure said judging from the provincial elections, their camp had more numbers with 4 072 councillors participating against 1 130 in Dr Madziire's 'Reform AFM'.</p>
      <p>'The problem is that the reform team (Dr Madziire's camp) violated the constitution by postponing the elections which were due in April this year. The constitution's Chapter 9 and also Chapter 9 of the regulations all provide that elections must be held after every three years but the reform team wanted to change that,' he said.</p>
      <p>'The September 22, 2018 workers council passed a vote of no confidence against Madziire and Madawu (general secretary) because there was a two-thirds quorum of the workers council. Madawu says he fired Rev Chiyangwa. He can't do that because he was also fired by the 22 September meeting.</p>
      <p>'The reform team also tempered with the constitution so that Madawu succeeds Madziire but he can't do that because he is less than 50 years old. So if they decide to leave AFM, they can do so because they are the ones who are trying to bring new doctrine to the church.'</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Rev Madawu wrote to the church leadership under Dr Madziire that the new constitution will be adopted once contributions from members of the church have been included.</p>
      <p>He said the workers council will consider the input from the church members by December 15, 2018, after which the new constitution will be adopted.</p>
      <p>'At the workers council meeting at which national elections shall be conducted, the apostolic council resolved to table its interpretation before the workers council and seek the condonation of the workers council and the ratification of all elections conducted in line with the apostolic council interpretation of the resolution of the workers council,' wrote Rev Madawu.</p>
      <p>In a bid to quench the nasty church fight, AFM International president Pastor Frank Chikane sent a circular to all AFM presidents on September 28, 2018, issuing instructions on how to solve the AFM Zimbabwe problems.</p>
      <p>He said the AFM Zimbabwe apostolic council must resolve the constitution amendments by January 2019.</p>
      <p>'No one should be made to feel that the proposed amendments to the constitution are imposed on them without their consideration and views,' said Pastor Chikane.</p>
      <p>'It is our prayer that you will all find it within yourselves - with the help of the Lord - to execute these decisions to ensure that the unity of the church is not impacted negatively because of a reform process.'</p>
      <p>The AFM International secretary general Pastor George Mahlobo also wrote on September 6, 2018, saying AFM Zimbabwe conflicts 'have reached a level where they are affecting the life, integrity and credibility of AFM International'. He urged the AFM Zimbabwe to desist from using the courts to resolve problems but use an out of court settlement agreement to avert the crisis.</p>
      <p>'Having done our assessment, we are convinced that the protagonists and antagonists in the battle relating to this reform process are prepared to rack or destroy the church as well as impede the move of the Holy Spirit within the church, in pursuit of their interests, individually and collectively. This is what the AFM International is out to stop in the interest of the AFM Zimbabwe, AFM International and the church of Christ,' said Pastor Mahlobo.</p>
      <p>'We are calling on all members and assemblies of the AFM Zimbabwe to engage in 24-hour chain prayers about the crisis, that the Lord touch leadership at all levels to act in a way that will save the church and ensure that it continues to pursue its ministry and mission the Lord has called it to pursue; and not allow administrative and constitutional matters to divide the church.'</p>

      <title>A little beer for a little cheer!</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>I will never trust anyone with my beer no matter how less inclined to help themselves to it they appear.</p>
      <p>Not anymore!</p>
      <p>What I went through at my nephew's graduation party in Crowborough North, Harare, was an eye-opener and I do not think I would ever want to have a second bite of that cherry.</p>
      <p>My in-laws honoured me with a crate of chilled beers and in order to ensure I drank every drop, I handed it over for safekeeping to women who were singing songs of adoration while resplendent in their religious attire holding rattles and tambourines.</p>
      <p>My first and second visits to the fridge were without incident, but by the third visit I could not find my beer, while the women were now singing with merriment.</p>
      <p>One of the women shouted that the beer tasted good while wearing a broad smile that exposed missing and yellowing teeth as she performed some lewd dance routines.</p>
      <p>I got more than I bargained for.</p>
      <p>You need no expertise in criminology or investigations to sniff out whoever would have stolen beer.</p>
      <p>They soon exposed themselves with a massive change in demeanour and a propensity to add their voice to every issue under discussion.</p>
      <p>The frequent visits to the loo are also quite telling.</p>
      <p>People out there really love their beer.</p>
      <p>'Vakomana doro rinonaka, dai waive mufushwa ndaisa muhomwe,' sang the legendary Thomas 'Mukanya' Mapfumo with his booming voice.</p>
      <p>Alick Macheso was not to be outdone.</p>
      <p>In the song called 'Kutsvaga Chiremba', Macheso sings: 'Pagova nehukorwa hwahwa, ukahunwa unodhakwa. Vamwe tinonwira hunodzima stress, vamwe tichinwira hunovaraidza pfungwa.'</p>
      <p>No matter where you go under the sun, beer is big business.</p>
      <p>No social gathering, be it a child christening party, birthday party, general party, wedding or funeral, can be said to be complete without the wise waters.</p>
      <p>Even at traditional marriages, beer is often a pre-requisite as the ability to buy it is usually interpreted as a bridegroom's ability to provide for the would-be bride.</p>
      <p>Some preachers are known to perform wonders on the pulpit after downing one or two cold ones.</p>
      <p>Family elders too are known to gulp a few before sitting down to tackle pressing issues.</p>
      <p>People who do not drink beer are often the butt of jokes at beerhalls and other drinking spots as they are considered to be stingy.</p>
      <p>'I wonder how people who do not drink beer while away their time. You cannot wake up and spend the day at home without giving women a chance to gossip about you. A man worth his salt must have time to mix and mingle with other men. Ungaswere mumba kuti wave poto here? You must meet other men and discuss life over a mug of beer,' I heard men saying while sharing opaque beer at an imbibing spot recently.</p>
      <p>'I have no time for people who do not drink beer. After exchanging greetings and whining about the weather, what else do you say to each other?' questioned one elderly man while wiping his mouth with the back of the hand after taking a deep gulp of the traditional brew.</p>
      <p>Some women are of the same view.</p>
      <p>'I do not want my daughter to marry someone who does not drink beer. Such men are a big challenge. They ask too many questions and this takes away happiness from the home,' one woman told this writer.</p>
      <p>'Men who do not drink beer are womanisers because they have nothing to commit their time to. If you do not drink beer, you are less likely to have good interpersonal skills because you just spend time with your workmates, church mates and members of your family,' said another woman.</p>
      <p>Gentle reader, beer is big business I tell you. Aside from frequenting drinking spots to quaff the wise waters, all manner of traders frequent these places to sell their wares.</p>
      <p>It is not unusual to find plumbers, car washers, tailors and those who sell their herbs at drinking spots.</p>
      <p>In this Covid-19 era, it is also common to find people selling sanitisers and hand-made face masks. However, steep increases in the cost of beer in recent weeks are threatening to steal the glitter from beer drinking.</p>
      <p>Prices have shot through the roof, making DDOs (Daily Drinking Officers) seriously think of staying at home observing lockdown rules.</p>
      <p>Prohibitive prices have also boosted demand for moonshine and other illicit brews that have serious health implications for imbibers.</p>
      <p>While beer makes people merry, it is critical to observe the law and avoid behaviour that endangers life.</p>

      <title>Bumpy road is still a road to greatness</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Somewhere in some minds lies a secret little wishful myth. It is a myth that the road to greatness is a smooth multi-lane highway in which you can drive as fast as you dare, arriving quickly and effortlessly without delay, challenge or work. This only happens in dreamland. Holding such idle thoughts just sets you up for nightmares. The reality is that the road to any place worth going will occasionally be a bumpy ride. Everyone who has achieved any measure of greatness has a story to tell.</p>
      <p>Challenges are part of the journey to greatness. Stop thinking like a victim and thinking that the whole world owes you a favour. You have a role to play in delivering your greatness. Take personal responsibility for doing and playing your part. You cannot expect others to fix what is broken while you stare and wonder what they are doing. Play your part.</p>
      <p>Obstacles are the stepping stones you meet on the path to significance. There are rivers to cross and these help you learn to swim. They are rocks to climb, these help you learn to scale up. There are mountains to face, and these help train your faith and focus. There are lions to face, these help you tame your fears. When the road gets bumpy, get ready to focus and do not stop moving and resign from action. Never lose your confidence because things are not what you expect them to be. Head ahead, keep your goals aglow before you, keep your faith aflame and go hunting for greatness with agility.</p>
      <p>Automate greatness</p>
      <p>You automate your drive to greatness through the habits of thought, and action that you embrace. People are not creatures of discipline, they are creatures of habit. It is your habits that determine your timbre of discipline. What you do daily determines what you become ultimately. The secret to your greatness is found in the things you do daily and consistently. Identify and address the habits that are holding you back. Limiting habits could be something you do, how you think or what you say to others and to yourself. Until you change, nothing else will change. No change matters more than your personal change.</p>
      <p>Look around at those who are producing the results that you want to also produce. Look out at their habits, the way they speak, think and do things. Habits of the poor are different from habits of the rich.</p>
      <p>Habits of those going nowhere are different from those of those going somewhere. Habits of those who fly differ from those who drive. Choose your habits and they will choose your destiny. The things that they do daily matter and determine those you meet. If you do what great people do, you will accelerate your own ascent to greatness. Live on purpose and automate your drive towards greatness by adopting winning and empowering habits.</p>
      <p>You install new habits by consistently doing something for at least 21 days. You install habits even better when you do something consistently for 40 days. Do not try to change everything you do at once. Just pick one of two critical habits that you want to develop and work those into your life for the next 40 days. For your life to work, turn your life into a project and work on it. Do not try to swallow an elephant because you are hurrying towards greatness, just take a bite at a time and be consistent. Change happens daily but not in a single day. Concentrate your focus and you will move forward with speed.</p>
      <p>Focus F=forward</p>
      <p>You go in whatever direction you choose to look. Greatness is not gambling, and success is not a speculation. Greatness is a result of focus and not hocus-pocus. Preserve and protect your focus. Eliminate superstition from your thinking and stop going around looking for speculative devices to bolster your courage. It is not everything that comes you way that must be done.</p>
      <p>Some things you have to dump, others you have to delegate and those that matter you must do brilliantly. You will not move ahead without mastering the power of 'Yes and No'. Your default answer to everything cannot just be yes. Be comfortable with the use of 'yes' when it aligns with your values and goals. Use 'No' boldly and courageously. You do not have to self-afflict yourself with guilt because you said, 'no!' to something that breaks your focus and is not aligned with your values. If something does not serve you and detracts you from your focus on the road ahead, dump it.</p>
      <p>Hocus-pocus</p>
      <p>Stop playing hocus-pocus with your life and really focus. Write down your goals, plot your strategy. Just the very fact of writing helps you clarify your mind. Everyday compile a to-do list. Work from the most important item. You may not finish everything on the list, but you will be a lot more focused than someone without a list. Narrow the things you need to do. The more focused you are, the clearer your mind will be. Stop playing grasshopper games, jumping from place to place without any real focus. Be clear in your mind about your focus and what you are driving towards. Other people may not see what I call your 'base of focus' and may think you are taking on too much. When your base of focus is clear, your actions will be coordinated and coherent. Others may not see your focus base, do not bother explaining this to them, just focus. Focus on the road ahead and keep driving. Do not let any pothole put you off the road. Do not let any detour detract you from driving towards your greatness.</p>
      <p>Look ahead</p>
      <p>Do not let the torrent of the current overwhelm you. Look at the big picture and the destination ahead. You are more powerful than you think. Your mind is able to conceive ideas and models that would surprise and transform you. Harness your thought-power and direct it towards great things. If you knew the power of your mind, you would not abuse it through purposeless worry. If you knew the power of your thoughts, you would not afford to squander opportunity by dwelling on negativity. When you focus your mind on creative solutions, you start to see them everywhere. When you look ahead, you start seeing beautiful horizons and possibilities ahead.</p>
      <p>Look ahead because that is where you are headed. Keep the big picture in mind because thinking small will not serve you. You have the power to become anything that you dream and dare purse. Do not be stuck on the launch-pad. Do not be stuck in sawing saw-dust. Dreams can come true but the first step is to dream them. The negativity around you programmes you for mediocrity. Cut that evil chain. Believe that you can, be excellent and world class at what you do. It must first be a mindset and a way of thinking. You will never reach for the skies while perking for worms. Focus on excellence and do whatever you do with excellence, brilliance and commitment.</p>
      <p>Quit fearing failure. Do not let the fear of failure induce you to think small, believe micro and commit to mini efforts. Just look ahead towards greatness. Do not scale down your vision to fit the comfort-levels of those who think small, desire little and are content with remaining where they are. If others are going nowhere, do not be tempted to adopt their driving style or lackadaisical speed. You have great places to go, and you do not afford to be thinking and behaving like those that are going nowhere.</p>
      <p>Possibility minded</p>
      <p>Stop thinking about your limitations and let your mind dwell on possibilities and potential. It is not what you cannot do that matters but what you can do. It is not what you do not have that matters but using what you have. Do not look down on yourself and what you have in your hands. Do not be so hung up on resources that you fail to see that your thoughts and faith are your real leverage and wealth. The thoughts that you have are fashioning your world. You will not play in the elephant kingdom thinking like an ant and having the mindset of a grasshopper. Think differently and you will start attracting different people in your life. Remove the limitations of scarce resources and open your mind to your unlimited potential.</p>
      <p>Persist and keep at it. If you are delayed, do not abandon the journey. If the past abused you, do not abuse the future by letting the past torment you in the future. Rise above your challenges, soar above your storms. Greatness is your portion. Think greatness. Talk greatness and do great things.</p>

      <title>Boastful Jere lauds his Green Machine</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THERE is a positive vibe at Caps United and expectations are high in the green half of the capital that 2019 could be the year Makepekepe reclaims the league title from FC Platinum.</p>
      <p>Club president Farai Jere sounded bullish after yesterday's all stakeholder meeting held at Mt Pleasant High, declaring that the current squad was one of the best his side has assembled 'in a long time.'</p>
      <p>Makepekepe have made some wise buys in the market and in Phineas Bhamusi and Gabriel Nyoni, they have two of the deadliest wingers in the league today.</p>
      <p>Lloyd Chitembwe has also brought in experienced striker Newman Sianchali from Highlanders while the youthful trio of Pride Zivengwa, Blessing Sarupinda and Clive Rupiya are also now at the Green Machine.</p>
      <p>Some of the key players who have been retained at Makepekepe are goalkeepers Chris Mverechena and Prosper Chigumba, veteran midfielders Dominic Mukandi and Joel 'Josta' Ngodzo as well as striker John Zhuwawu.</p>
      <p>Ageless centre back Method Mwanjali, skipper Hardlife Zvirekwi and rising wing back Valentine Musarurwa are also still with Caps United.</p>
      <p>And Jere is speaking glowingly of his 'powerful' machine which he believes can gun for the league title.</p>
      <p>'This squad we have is one of the best we assembled in a very long time. It's quite an energetic team that has both experience and youths.</p>
      <p>'We are expecting a lot from this team,' said Jere.</p>
      <p>The presence at yesterday's meeting of Loveness Govera, a representative from last season's main sponsor NetOne, was a big hint that the mobile network provider will renew their sponsorship package for Makepekepe.</p>
      <p>NetOne signed a one-year deal worth $350 000 with Caps United at the beginning of last season and also extended the same to the other giants Dynamos and Highlanders.</p>
      <p>While chances are high DeMbare could lose the NetOne sponsorship, all points to a renewal of the marriage between Makepekepe and the mobile network company.</p>
      <p>Jere, however, downplayed the presence of Govera.</p>
      <p>'We always meet our stakeholders before the start of every season and today (yesterday) we met the chairpersons of the supporters' chapters from across the country.</p>
      <p>'Loveness (Govera) was here as a staunch Caps United supporter, talks with NetOne are still ongoing,' said Jere.</p>
      <p>The Caps United boss, who was flanked by his vice Nhamo Tutisani during his keynote address, also presented the new look board to the stakeholders who attended the meeting.</p>
      <p>Law expert Misheck Hogwe, renowned sports administrator Titus Zvomuya and Dr Nick Munyonga are now in the Caps United board.</p>
      <p>Tich Mawoni, a sports marketing enthusiast who was instrumental in the bringing of the Barcelona legends to Harare last year, Dr Slyvester Maungaindze and Farai Mafunga are also part of the board.</p>
      <p>'We have been telling you about our desire to turn this club into a truly commercial entity and the composition of the board proves that we are taking a new dimension,' said Jere.</p>

      <title>Forex auction restores hope</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The foreign exchange auction system, which had a flying start, has reignited prospects of a stable Zimbabwe dollar, which would help forestall the impact of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>After only two successful auctions, grain millers have already indicated that they expect the price of bread flour to fall significantly on account of improved access to cheaper foreign currency for wheat imports, a development expected in all other sections of the economy.</p>
      <p>The millers said most businesses had resorted to using black market rates when quoting prices of goods and services and the premiums must now translate into price reduction across all economic sectors, because the auction now provides access to cheaper forex.</p>
      <p>Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) chairperson Mr Tafadzwa Musarara said the auction is expected to create a reliable and cheaper source of foreign currency.</p>
      <p>'It (access to forex) has been fair and very effective so far. It is a reliable way of getting foreign currency, which makes it easier even to remit (forex) outside the country without the risk of violating the law.</p>
      <p>'There is also another risk that has been averted (through forex auction system): the risk of buying foreign currency on the parallel market only for the funds remitted to be flagged as laundered money.</p>
      <p>'Everyone was using the black market for their costing and now they are getting foreign currency cheaper at perhaps 40 percent lower than the black market, so we expect that 40 percent savings to be pushed to consumers,' he said.</p>
      <p>The exchange rate eased to $63,7 against US$1 at the second straight auction on Tuesday this week, a movement of just over 10 percent from the $57,3 realised at the inaugural auction as more importers took part.</p>
      <p>Most of the forex was allotted to the productive sectors of the economy. The auction system, which was introduced on June 23, replaced the stuttering interbank market that had been adopted in February last year.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, however, temporarily adopted a fixed exchange rate regime of 1:25 in March to militate against the devastating effects of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>But this made it uneconomic for exporters to sell at fixed rate, resulting in many withholding their funds and starving the market.</p>
      <p>This unleashed a wave of successive price increases that have since eroded incomes, especially for low income earners. Also, savings have been buttered while inflation has shot to a post-dollarisation high of 786 percent by May, from 5,4 percent in September 2019.</p>
      <p>Without a systemic market-based exchange rate determination system, the market sought to hedge the ravaging impact of exchange rate volatility and escalating inflation through forward pricing, setting prices way above the speculative open market rates.</p>
      <p>Hope for economic recovery</p>
      <p>Authorities may have found a viable solution in the auction system, which captains of industry believe has restored hopes for the economy.</p>
      <p>Analysts initially forecast the economy to slump between 15 to 20 percent this year due to Covid-19.</p>
      <p>Before the outbreak of the disease, Government initially projected a 3,6 percent growth. Industrialists said the absence of a formal foreign exchange market had made it increasingly difficult to access foreign currency for businesses, in addition to fuelling local currency volatility.</p>
      <p>'High unemployment, low production and productivity levels and the currency crisis had almost eliminated any recovery prospects of the economy,' Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) said in a policy response paper on the new foreign exchange auction system.</p>
      <p>It also said the doing business environment has been worsened by the Covid-19 outbreak, which has shuttered global economies and collapsed aggregate demand, disrupted supply chains, caused job losses and debt accumulation, including working capital constraints.</p>
      <p>True auction system</p>
      <p>The industry lobby group, however, cautioned that there was need to continue operating the auction system transparently, especially drawing from past unsuccessful experiences in 2004 and 2005.</p>
      <p>'The auction was tried in 2004-2005 and failed. We know why it failed, but we will learn from history and avoid the same mistake.</p>
      <p>'As we all know, the key success factors are: allow the auction to be a true auction and maintain fiscal and monetary discipline,' CZI said.</p>
      <p>For the auction system to succeed, CZI added, there was need for market confidence by allowing free interplay of market forces while authorities must religiously maintain an iron-clad grip on fiscal and monetary discipline, including ensuring stability of local currency.</p>
      <p>'For the auction to work and influence the price of foreign exchange across the economy, it must be perceived to be credible. We know that the auction market in 2004 degenerated into an allocation system, not an auction. So, the question is: how can we ensure that the auction is perceived by the market as credible?'</p>
      <p>The industrial body believes that it is critical to maintain stability of the Zimbabwe dollar and its viability as a store of value.</p>

      <title>BEAST retires at the top</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok legend Tendai 'Beast' Mtawarira has announced his retirement from international rugby.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old veteran of 117 Tests confirmed his decision after a monumental performance in his final match, Saturday's emphatic, 32-12, victory over England in the Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama, Japan.</p>
      <p>In a trademark scrumming performance from the 115kg front ranker, the Springbok pack forced a succession of penalties from their opponents, many of them conceded by Mtawarira's direct opponent. It crowned a storied career for the Springboks' and Cell C Sharks' 'gentle giant'.</p>
      <p>Mtawarira made his senior provincial debut for the Cell C Sharks in 2006 and won his first Springbok cap in 2008, setting records on the way.</p>
      <p>'Beast' became the third most-capped Springbok (behind Victor Matfield and Bryan Habana), the most capped prop, made the most appearances for a South African Vodacom Super Rugby team (159) and won the Rugby World Cup (2019), Tri-Nations (2009), Castle Lager Rugby Championship (2019), a series against the British and Irish Lions (2009) and the Currie Cup (2008, 2010 and 2013).</p>
      <p>'I've been privileged to play this great game and achieve many career goals over the last 12 years of playing senior rugby,' said Mtawarira.</p>
      <p>'I've been blessed to have been part of teams that achieved so much success over the years, and I have many memories to cherish forever, but I can honestly say that winning the Rugby World Cup is the perfect ending and cherry on top.</p>
      <p>'I am grateful for the opportunities afforded to me by many top coaches at the Springboks and the Sharks, and grateful to my numerous team mates in green and gold, and black and white, over the years.</p>
      <p>'But most of all, to my wife Kuziva, and our two beautiful children, Talumba and Wangu, for sacrificing so much to allow me to chase my dreams. I really appreciate it immensely.</p>
      <p>'I would also like to thank my parents, other family and friends for their support over the years - I could not have done this without you.'</p>
      <p>Mark Alexander, President of SA Rugby, paid tribute to Mtawarira, who made his Springbok debut in the second Test against Wales in Pretoria in 2008, and played his last match in green and gold in Yokohama last Saturday.</p>
      <p>''Beast' is someone who never complained, always put in the hard work and simply got on with his job in his typically unassuming way,' said Alexander.</p>
      <p>'When he first got an opportunity at the Sharks, he rode a bicycle to training, which perfectly sums up not only his humbleness, but his desire to make it to the top. He worked very hard to achieve what he has and we're all very proud of him.</p>
      <p>''Beast', thank you for what you've done for South African rugby, to show that Springboks can indeed be gentle giants, and for never putting your own interests above that of the team. We salute you and will miss you in green and gold.'</p>

      <title>How Choga muscled his way to legendary status</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>IN these times of strife, pandemics and lockdowns, every sport needs a character like Innocent Choga - someone who is not only a champion, but carries himself like one.</p>
      <p>Someone with the weight and the guts to talk and have people listen.</p>
      <p>And as a six-time Mr Zimbabwe champion - the youngest in the history of the sport - and a National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness (NFZBBF) Hall of Famer, the 54-year-old certainly fits the bill, and boy does he have a lot to say.</p>
      <p>It is now eight years since Choga called time on a career that spanned over two decades, but he has remained attached to the sport and remains passionate about it.</p>
      <p>Choga is in the process of compiling snippets and anecdotes from his career, which he intends to include in his yet-to-be-titled autobiography.</p>
      <p>'Over the years, I have developed a passion for writing, research and a new-found appreciation for sport in general.</p>
      <p>'I am actually in the process of writing a couple of books, one of which will be an autobiography,' said Choga.</p>
      <p>'I do not want my children, or any of my descendants for that matter, to hear distorted history, and (I) would prefer they hear it from the horse's mouth, so to speak.</p>
      <p>'The other book called 'Weight Training for Every Body' will not just be an instruction book, but an alignment of my 40 years of weight training experience, and my recently acquired Physical Education knowledge,'' he said.</p>
      <p>Choga, however, is not considering a comeback as he is content with what he achieved.</p>
      <p>'I have been retired for a long time and I do not have the urge to compete again. I have not been weight training as religiously as before, but I always go back to the gym regularly and even then I do not lift heavy weights like I used to.</p>
      <p>'I am still very active, though; when I am not going to the gym, I exercise regularly without weights and monitor what I eat.</p>
      <p>'For a person my age, I think I am very fit and carry the appropriate weight for my frame.'</p>
      <p>He, however, has some regrets.</p>
      <p>'Being suspended twice for flimsy reasons in 1991 and in 1996 is one of the blemishes on my career.</p>
      <p>'Competitively, I can't really say I have regrets, as I am happy and content with what I managed to achieve during my years on the stage.</p>
      <p>'Obviously, when I was young I used to dream of winning the Olympia (the highest professional bodybuilding title), but that dream faded with time,' he said.</p>
      <p>But it is a storied career that includes three Junior Iron Man titles, two Zimbabwe Junior Championships and six Zimbabwe Senior National Bodybuilding Championships that make him a legend in the sport.</p>
      <p>He represented Zimbabwe at the World Championships in Australia, France and Malaysia.</p>
      <p>He memorably was placed eighth out of competitors from 32 countries in Siberia, Russia, at the Tyumen Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>Choga is also a former Namibian Open Championships winner and was inducted into the NFZBBF Hall of Fame in 2015.</p>
      <p>The first national title and HOF induction rank second and third on his list of career highlights, with the former coming when he was only 22.</p>
      <p>'My first win was inspired and kind of prophetic and I remember being so focused on that one goal.</p>
      <p>'To commemorate it, I hung a poster in my room written 'Innocent Choga (22) wins the National Championships'.</p>
      <p>'Worldwide, winning the National Bodybuilding Championships at the age of 22 is considered a great feat in bodybuilding, as senior bodybuilding relies mostly on maturity.</p>
      <p>'At 21, the capacity to build huge muscles is still low, so you would still belong to the junior ranks, and I defied all that,' he said.</p>
      <p>The athlete still cherishes his HOF induction.</p>
      <p>'It's a great feeling to be recognised for anything that you do well, but I felt honoured that the bodybuilding community thinks highly of me.</p>
      <p>'It gives validation to the work I put in and I would remiss if I did not thank those that helped me get here.</p>
      <p>'I am thankful and feel indebted to the likes of legendary athletes like Bible Mhizha and the late George Takundwa who motivated me, my training partners Oliver Sabau (junior), Paul Chidzero (senior) and the officials who made it possible for me to achieve what I achieved.'</p>
      <p>Choga also took time to thank Zimbabwe football legend Peter Ndlovu and Hollywood actress Sharon Stone - two people he met on his way up and gave him valuable words of advice.</p>
      <p>His greatest achievement remains furthering his education.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old now holds a Diploma in Business Studies, a Bachelor of Science Honours in Physical Education and Sport Degree, including Part C CIS.</p>
      <p>He also has a level two coaching certificate in badminton.</p>
      <p>These have given him a brand new appreciation for sport, and in particular bodybuilding, which literally saved his life in 2018, when he was injured while playing social soccer.</p>
      <p>'I was at a friends' football team, PIMA. After a training session, I joined in a scrimmage match.</p>
      <p>'I suppose I forgot my age and went down after trying to block a striker.</p>
      <p>'I couldn't get up, at first, and thought it was a mere dislocation . . . but it was worse.</p>
      <p>'It was a tendon rapture and needed surgery.</p>
      <p>'Many thought I was doomed because of my age, but thanks to the doctor, the physiotherapist, my employer, my exercise background and knowledge, I managed to recover.</p>
      <p>'I still get sore here and there, but that has been minimised through regular exercise.'</p>
      <p>Now Choga wants to give back and hopes for the time when bodybuilding is taken seriously.</p>
      <p>'I have been watching the sport keenly and will be honest that sometimes I get disillusioned because of the trend the sport was taking internationally.</p>
      <p>'Athletes are sometimes way too big and don't put enough energy into toning.</p>
      <p>'National champions lack exposure and confine themselves to upmarket gyms.</p>
      <p>'In my days, we used to guest-pose and train in gyms in all four corners of Zimbabwe like Matapi, Mbare, Highfield, Mufakose, Dzivaresekwa, Victoria Falls, Gweru, Bulawayo, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>'I also prefer the term Zimbabwe National Bodybuilding Champion as opposed to Mr Zimbabwe, as the former sounds athletic and the latter sounds like a pageant title.</p>
      <p>'Internationally, there is no more Mr Universe, but World Championship, no more Mr America, but is now called American National Bodybuilding Championships.</p>
      <p>'If chess is a sport, why should bodybuilding not be a sport? We work hard in the gym all year round and we do not depend on genetics alone, and being beautiful or being handsome has nothing to do with it,' Choga said.</p>

      <title>The customers is always king!</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The advent of globalisation has seen competition for markets getting to unprecedented levels with companies investing so much in getting to know more about their customers.</p>
      <p>These companies know that knowledge about the customer signifies power which can help them build a sustainable competitive advantage. Therefore, they are using different tactics to fight for customers and these fights are necessitated by the fact that all companies including non-profit organisations require revenue which is a necessary resource for any organisation to survive or fight off competition. Thus, these wars are centered on one particular objective.</p>
      <p>The objective is getting as much revenue as possible from one source … the customer!</p>
      <p>But who is the revenue's main driver? According to Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, 'There is only one boss, the customer and he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman down to the last man by simply spending his money somewhere'.</p>
      <p>Thus, the main driver of revenue is the CUSTOMER. Big and small organisations are engaging in cold wars in order to get the customer's attention so that he or she can spend all they have in their respective establishments.</p>
      <p>This is a great sign that, indeed, the customer has strong bargaining power and organisations must, therefore, have knowledge about their customer so that they are able to dance according to the customer tune and serve him better. It is also imperative for companies to use customer knowledge as ammunition for this warfare so as to excel in customer service provision.</p>
      <p>Customer service is basically the way in which organisations take care of the needs of their customers in a bid to fulfill and satisfy these needs, differentiate their product or service from competitors, decrease marketing costs and increase customer loyalty.</p>
      <p>Over the past few years, companies are focusing more on the customer by putting in place strategies that help them have intimate knowledge about their customers which they will use to forge long lasting relationships.</p>
      <p>True business relationships with customers normally results in loyalty by either part because they are based on trust and mutual respect. According to Bose and RAO (2011), loyalty is the customer's commitment to do business with a particular organisation which results in repeat purchases of goods and services of that particular organisation.</p>
      <p>For that loyalty to occur the organisation must also play its part and in this case it should have enablers in place that allow customers to develop that loyalty which will mean repeat purchases, testimonials and referrals. Customer security is one such enabler and is of paramount importance in customer service.</p>
      <p>The big questions now are: how well do Zimbabwean companies know about their customers and their needs to such an extent that they are able to take care of them while the same customer is able to experience delight?</p>
      <p>Do they even invest in providing quality customer service to their customers or it is a matter of just getting them to spend their hard-earned elusive dollar in their shops and then forget about them the moment they step on the exit door?</p>
      <p>Will these companies thrive in the modern dog-eat-dog world?</p>
      <p>From a customer service perspective these are some of the most pertinent issues that must be addressed by an organisation that have an appetite to have an extended shelf life of existence.</p>
      <p>Companies that have existed for decades know who their paymaster is and they are continually providing innovative solutions that keep the paymaster smiling and willing to come back and spend more. It is unfortunate that most Zimbabwean companies are found wanting when it comes to knowing and investing in their customer security thereby leaving an unfulfilled gap which might be detrimental in the long run.</p>
      <p>The security of the customer is not only an audit department issue but should encompass all the organisational departments because a lack of customer security in one department may affect the whole organisation in terms of organisational perception by its target market.</p>
      <p>Back home, there has been a lot of talk on 'Zimbabwe is open for business', which is an excellent campaign to market and integrate the nation into the business world, but the million dollar question is, 'how well prepared are our local business people to invest in customer security before opening up business to both the local and the foreign customers?</p>
      <p>The 'Zimbabwe is open for business' will be a futile rhetoric if the business community does not know the importance of customers and customer security to the business and how they should be taken care of.</p>

      <title>Are you a dreaded micro-manager?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>IF there is one thing that is a buzz killer and an energy and motivation sapper for subordinates it is micromanagement by superiors. If you are one of the bosses who micromanage, do I have news for you!</p>
      <p>Micromanagement leads to high levels of stress, low morale, loss of productivity and dread in the office, among other negative repercussions.</p>
      <p>In fact, micromanaging bosses are every employee's worst nightmare. A micromanaging boss kills efficiency.</p>
      <p>To be fair, though, no manager wishes to micromanage staff. The challenge, according to entrepreneur Aaron Haynes, is that: the line between an efficient manager and a micro-manager is sometimes blurred, and it is very easy to cross it, without being aware that one is now on a slippery slope to becoming a dysfunctional boss.</p>
      <p>What are the signs that you are a micromanaging boss?</p>
      <p>According to Haynes, here are some characteristics that show that you are in fact predisposed to micromanagement.</p>
      <p>The thought of losing</p>
      <p>control scares you</p>
      <p>Because of your need to control, you are obsessed with knowing what staff are doing. And, everything must be done your way or you are not satisfied. Therefore, you often call back work you assign, because it is not up to your standards. On top of that, you dish out instructions, but make it impossible for your team to input their own ideas. As a result, you stifle their creativity, communication and self-development, while leaving no option for effective productivity. Holding on tightly to control out of fear will eventually cause you to lose it in the end.</p>
      <p>You believe you have the best approach to every task</p>
      <p>Believing you know best, you view your employees' work as inferior. Therefore, your actions scream that their work is substandard, a strong sign that you are micromanaging. You do not give them the opportunity to use their skills, talents and know-how. Instead, you implement all the ideas, take control of communicating with clients and make decisions based on your knowledge. Believing you have all the answers for resolving tasks, you work on them solo. This attitude pushes employees aside causing them to doubt their own capabilities.</p>
      <p>You itch to lead</p>
      <p>Leading is not a bad thing. On the other hand, a forceful boss who is unwilling to negotiate, always interfering and unable to offer flexibility, is a poor leader. Continual interference is a sign you lack confidence in your employees. Nevertheless, there are times when it is necessary to lead, especially in large financial transactions, vital decision-making or other important business areas requiring managerial authority. However, if you are always in the driver's seat and find it difficult to allow employees to manage everyday tasks, this creates uncertainty and resentment. As an alternative, train staff, build trust and support them.</p>
      <p>You suspect everybody (but you) wastes time and resources</p>
      <p>One of the most annoying traits of a micro-manager is their suspicion. Because you suspect everyone is either wasting time or company resources, you are always prying. You command a detailed record of phone calls, meetings, spending, tasks or anything else you think could be wasted. This obsession brings stress on everyone.</p>
      <p>Constantly judging and prying will eventually create lack of faith in you and drive employees out of the company.</p>
      <p>You call for endless, unnecessary meetings</p>
      <p>Micro-managers use any excuse to call for a meeting. Usually, these meetings are nothing to do with work productivity. They are a pretext for finding irrelevant faults. Or you attend meetings to get your points across in discussions that do not require your presence.</p>
      <p>Another sign is insisting all employees attend meetings, whether the topic is relevant to them or not.</p>
      <p>You have challenges delegating</p>
      <p>Everyone has the same amount of time during the day. However, your time seems less than others. Could this be because you do not know how to delegate? Each day you are overloaded with trivial tasks and projects that rarely get completed. Lack of delegation and communication with your employees forces you to micromanage rather than distribute responsibilities. Instead of retracting delegated tasks, allow employees to handle jobs within their capability. Practice developing your delegation skills to reduce your workload and give employees a sense of ownership.</p>
      <p>You try to run a one-man show</p>
      <p>Perhaps you have the attitude that micromanagement means taking on everything by yourself. Consequently, you lack faith in your employees' abilities and bear the brunt of the workload. You are busy fretting about their productivity and criticising their work, leaving you little time to manage properly. Rather than working with them to develop a competent team, you set them up to depend on you. This leads to increased workload and bigger pressures on you, amplifying the danger of impending burnout.</p>
      <p>Finally, perhaps you have good intentions at heart but still cross the line over into becoming a micro-manager. If you identified with any of the earlier danger signs, you are now in a better position to improve your management skills. One way to improve working relationships is to get regular feedback from staff. Transform yourself from being a dreaded micro-manager to becoming a valued, respected leader.</p>

      <title>Success in family-owned businesses: The facts</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>International consultancy firm, Vector Consulting, says the success of family-owned businesses is anchored on six pillars that guide their growth in uncertain markets.</p>
      <p>This comes as family businesses across the globe play a critical role in economies contributing immensely to job creation.</p>
      <p>They may start small but most of them have grown into large conglomerates with the Meikles group being one such example in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Most budding small to medium enterprises in Zimbabwe are family businesses.</p>
      <p>Profitability, risk, debt management, discipline, directorship and governance are the key areas that make family businesses successful, as identified by Vector founder and author Mr Ahmed Seedat.</p>
      <p>On risk, Mr Seedat indicated that first- and second-generation families are risk-averse, cautious in their decision-making, and they manage their decisions with culture, norms and values. All decisions are made following careful consultation while debt management is crucial with families growing their businesses organically and take on as little debt as possible.</p>
      <p>'This is because debt is viewed as a step towards greed,' said Mr Seedat.</p>
      <p>According to the consulting firm, while directorships are assumed, there is a paradigm shift being witnessed, with families populating their boards with non-shareholder or 'gene' directorships.</p>
      <p>The firm maintains directorships are evolving from the later phase of the second generation to the third generation.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, a balanced board brings about better governance with family shareholders and independent directors which is better for all stakeholders.</p>
      <p>On profitability, Seedat said: 'The expenses are diligently controlled and there will be no venturing into products they don't understand.</p>
      <p>'Their capital base is adequately deployed so as to earn a desired return on investment. They work on a determined margin that has proven to be effective, investing profits conservatively to mitigate statutory payments in later times.'</p>
      <p>On the last pillar, which is discipline, Seedat says the first generation instils discipline into the second generation, which then thinks out the box.</p>
      <p>However, the second generation needs to be shown the correct methodology, to present ideas to the family in a disciplined manner, ensuring respect is maintained, according to the consulting firm.</p>
      <p>Seedat said new entrants into business needed to be cognisant of these six pillars while understanding the culture of the business, the supply chain relationships and the stakeholder relationships.</p>
      <p>Family-owned businesses are recognised today as an important and distinct organisation in the world economy and operate in every country. According to Reference for Business, more than 90 percent of the companies in North America and a majority of businesses located around the world are family-owned.</p>

      <title>Govt pours $6bn into capital projects, more expected</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>GOVERNMENT sank over $6 billion during the first half of the year into infrastructure development projects to stimulate economic productivity, while an additional $18 billion would be injected during the remainder of the year, official data shows.</p>
      <p>The projects, which fall under the 2020 Zimbabwe Infrastructure Investment Programme covering transport, water and sanitation, public amenities, and irrigation, have all been financed through domestic financial resources. Funding from international finance institutions such as the World Bank dried up in the past two decades owing to sanctions imposed by the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
      <p>An update on national projects from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development availed to The Sunday Mail indicates progress on 12 major developmental projects ranging from rehabilitation of the Harare-Masvingo-Beitbridge Road to the upgrading of Robert Gabriel Mugabe (RGM) International Airport.</p>
      <p>Minister of State for Presidential Affairs in charge of Implementation and Monitoring Dr Jorum Gumbo told The Sunday Mail that most projects were progressing well.</p>
      <p>'What we have noticed since the coming in of the New Dispensation is that we can harness local resources for development,' said Dr Gumbo.</p>
      <p>'This does not mean that we do not need foreign support, but it goes to show how much we can do with local resources. Using the 100-Day Rapid Results System, we are managing to move from one point to the next, slowly but surely.</p>
      <p>'Of course, the pandemic is causing a lot of disruptions to progress but this has not stopped us from doing our work. You saw recently the President commissioning part of the Harare-Beitbridge highway, and we are saying that is progress we are talking about.</p>
      <p>'There is a lot that is happening across the country, the problem is that much of it has not been receiving adequate publicity.'</p>
      <p>Of the $24 billion resource envelope for the infrastructure projects, half will be financed from fiscal resources while the rest will be mobilised through loans, support from development partners and statutory as well as public entities' resources.</p>
      <p>Local finance</p>
      <p>Data from Treasury shows that nine out of the 12 priority projects are all being funded through the National Budget, while funding for the rest is coming from international loans and grants, primarily from China.</p>
      <p>Projects being funded by local resources include the restoration of road infrastructure destroyed by Cyclone Idai, upgrading of the Harare-Beitbridge highway, construction of Causeway, Marovanyati and Chivhu Dams, and the rehabilitation of Darwendale and Warren Control Pump Station.</p>
      <p>'Exogenous factors, in the form of Covid-19, climate change impacts of drought and floods as well as a difficult operating environment have necessitated reprioritisation of spending away from the development budget towards more urgent health priorities,' reads the statement.</p>
      <p>'Against the fiscal allocation of $12 billion towards infrastructure, a total of $6,6 billion has already been deployed towards projects as at July 31 2020 focusing on transport, water and sanitation, public amenities, irrigation amongst others.</p>
      <p>'This excludes the significant funds that are being disbursed under the 2020 intergovernmental fiscal transfer (devolution), which are also being earmarked to address basic social infrastructure needs at the community level.'</p>
      <p>The five contractors working on the Harare-Beitbridge highway have since been paid $1,8 billion.</p>
      <p>'Thirty-six kilometres have been completed and opened to traffic, 15km have been primed and await surfacing (tarring). A total of 200km is targeted for completion before year-end.'</p>
      <p>A further $300 million has been poured into repairing infrastructure damaged by Cyclone Idai, with works on major roads such as Birchenough-Chipinge, Nyanga-Rusape and Machongwe-Kopa now complete.</p>
      <p>Other roads damaged by the cyclone, including Skyline-Chimanimani and Wengezi-Skyline, are over 95 percent complete.</p>
      <p>For sanitation, Government sunk $385 million for the rehabilitation of water systems in Harare and Bulawayo.</p>
      <p>Rehabilitation of Darwendale and Warren Control pump stations in Harare have commenced, with contractors now awaiting shipment of 19 pumps.</p>
      <p>Cumulatively, Government has disbursed over $1 billion for the construction of three dams: Causeway (80 percent complete), which is now impounding water; Marovanyati (96 percent complete); and Chivhu (30 percent complete). Government also allocated $139 million for the rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes, planning and implementation of new schemes, which is ongoing.</p>
      <p>Loans, grants</p>
      <p>Through support from cooperating partners, three major projects are currently being implemented. At the RGM International Airport, Chinese contractors are upgrading the runway, building a new terminal building, additional aero-bridges and upgrading the communication systems, among other works.</p>
      <p>'Twenty-seven (27) percent for overall landslide works have been completed at RGM International Airport. Excavations and foundation works for arrivals and departures extensions have been completed. Concrete works are at 60 percent and 55 percent of brickwork done to date at level 4,90m.'</p>
      <p>Government is also projecting completion the New Parliament building by March next year after completion of the six-storey superstructure, with $30 million disbursed so far while other funds were provided by the Chinese government through a grant.</p>
      <p>Construction of Hwange units 7 and 8 - funded through a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China - is now 44 percent complete.</p>
      <p>Economist Professor Gift Magano said the projects were of great importance as they significantly contributed to the economy.</p>
      <p>'Infrastructure is a key enabler for economic growth and by focusing on infrastructure Government is stimulating economic growth,' he said.</p>
      <p>100-day programmes</p>
      <p>An array of other smaller projects include the manufacture of power transformers by Zesa, with 322 transformers having been completed out of a target of 570 during the third 100-day cycle.</p>
      <p>Twenty satellite schools in Chiredzi have also been upgraded and registered.</p>
      <p>Refurbishment of the ZimAlloys A3 furnace had reached 60 percent completion by July 22.</p>
      <p>The Midlands State University Innovation Hub last month started a national priority programme in indigenous fruit and herbs.</p>
      <p>Through Government support, the Intrachem Explosive Plant is under construction, with the superstructure now complete and storage tanks for raw materials erected.</p>
      <p>In Mutoko, a tomato processing plant has been completed. The plant seeks to improve livelihoods among youths through participation in the fruit and vegetable value chain. Electrification of Kanyemba was at 25 percent complete as of last week.</p>

      <title>Thousands expected back home as Covid-19 bites</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>OVER 11 000 Zimbabweans living in foreign lands have returned home since the Covid-19-induced lockdown, with thousands more still en-route and due to arrive over the next few weeks, official data shows.</p>
      <p>Stung largely by job losses and untenable living conditions, many were retracing their footsteps back home.</p>
      <p>Among the expected returnees, are over 1 000 Zimbabweans studying in the United States of America, who could be affected after the Donald Trump administration asked foreign students in the US, whose colleges have shifted to online teaching, to shift to schools that have in-person classes or leave the country.</p>
      <p>The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a statement saying that non-immigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may not take a full online course load and remain in that country.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is also expecting 300 of its citizens from China, mostly students who have completed their programmes.</p>
      <p>About 100 of those students were expected to come with an Air Zimbabwe plane that was already in China by last week.</p>
      <p>From South Africa, thousands await Government-assisted repatriation, with 300 Zimbabweans recently released from South African prisons being part of that delegation.</p>
      <p>This group is currently detained at South Africa's largest immigrant holding facility - Lindela Repatriation Centre - while Governments of the two countries arrange for their deportation.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mail has gathered that among the group were criminals convicted of serious crimes, including rape, armed robbery and murder.</p>
      <p>They have all been slapped with five-year bans from South Africa.</p>
      <p>The influx is raising serious concern about the possible importation of Covid-19 cases from hotspots such as the USA and South Africa.</p>
      <p>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo told The Sunday Mail that Government had requested South African authorities to delay the deportation of the criminals while arrangements were made on activating protocols to receive them safely.</p>
      <p>He said the decision to deport the prisoners came after some inmates in South African prisons tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
      <p>'We have more than 300 Zimbabweans who were released from various prisons in South Africa,' said Dr Moyo.</p>
      <p>'South Africa called us to say we are releasing your people, but, however, some had completed their sentences in the various prisons.</p>
      <p>'We negotiated with them so that they can at least keep them at the detention centre while we work on necessary arrangements and have them deported.'</p>
      <p>He said the Registrar-General was now verifying the nationality of the released criminals before they are allowed into Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Once verification is confirmed, the prisoners will be deported through Beitbridge Border Post.</p>
      <p>He said Government is considering staggering the deportation to make sure quarantine centres are not overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>'Our quarantine centres in Beitbridge are under a lot of pressure considering that we have huge numbers coming in through that port of entry.</p>
      <p>'We are, therefore, considering having them deported in smaller groups or having them quarantined in their various provinces.'</p>
      <p>The released prisoners, he added, have ceased to be the responsibility of the South African Department of Correctional Service and are now reliant on well-wishers for food.</p>
      <p>'These people are dependent on well-wishers for food, toiletries and other needs, which makes their situation a sensitive one. Well-wishers, most of whom are Zimbabweans, are helping to ensure they have food and other stuff that they need.'</p>
      <p>Influx</p>
      <p>Official data obtained from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows that 11 074 returnees had trooped back as of Tuesday last week.</p>
      <p>Hundreds more were expected to arrive from China during the week. South Africa has accounted for most of the returnees, with 5 043 having returned from the neighbouring country, while a further 3 628 came in from Botswana.</p>
      <p>Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Minister Mr David Musabayana said most of the returnees had been affected by adverse economic conditions in their adopted homes.</p>
      <p>'In terms of total returnees, as at the 7th of July, we had 11 074, of those males are 6 073 and females are 5 001,' he said.</p>
      <p>'The country that has given the most in terms of returnees is South Africa, which has given 5 043 returnees, followed by Botswana with 3 628 and Namibia with 357. From Mozambique, we have had 487 returnees and from Zambia we had 248.</p>
      <p>'Outside of Africa, from the United States of America we have had 263 returnees and a further 241 from Miami, while only 174 have returned from the United Kingdom. From China we have had 580 returnees.'</p>
      <p>He said all the returnees had gone through mandatory quarantine at designated centres throughout the country.</p>
      <p>'Most of these people were working for different organisations using work permits and because of the lockdowns most organisations were closed and they were pushed out of work. So, most of them saw it fit to come back home. Some are saying they had their contracts cancelled and could not afford to continue paying rentals and other living expenses,' he said.</p>
      <p>'Others have returned just because they felt it was time to come back home. Some were running away from epicentres and felt they would be safer at home.'</p>
      <p>He revealed that Zimbabweans with permanent residence permits from South Africa but were caught up in the lockdown before they could return to their foreign bases had begun requesting facilitation for their safe passage back to their adopted homes.</p>
      <p>'We have some Zimbabweans with permanent residence permits who were trapped here are and are now asking to return back to work, and we have since begun negotiating with South African authorities to allow them to go back.'</p>
      <p>Government, he said, was creating a database of all Zimbabwean citizens who died from Covid-19 in foreign lands in order to ascertain the true impact it has had on the Zimbabwean Diaspora.</p>
      <p>Upsurge</p>
      <p>Four people died of Covid-19 last week, with three deaths recorded on Thursday, the most in a day since the disease was first detected in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>A total of 208 new infections were recorded in the five days to Friday last week, as the number of cases surged to 942, just shy of the grim 1000 cases landmark.</p>
      <p>As of Friday, 320 recoveries had been recorded after Government adopted new World Health Organisation protocols, which consider a patient as recovered after showing symptoms once 13 days have passed from the first symptom and once 10 days have passed for those who did not show symptoms but still tested positive.</p>
      <p>This leaves 609 active cases.</p>
      <p>Cases have risen dramatically since the beginning of June.</p>
      <p>Four hundred and thirteen (413) new cases were recorded in June, while 351 new cases have been recorded in the first 10 days of this month.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe is also witnessing a surge in the number of local transmissions, and Government is now mulling tightening lockdown regulations.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, two Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals nurses working in the Covid-19 centre returned positive results.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the hospital said: 'Two out of the 26 staff members who had just completed one of their shifts in our Covid-19 centre tested positive for SARS-Cov-2.</p>
      <p>'The team had just completed their second weekly shift and underwent the routine testing on the eighth day after their shift while in mandatory quarantine.'</p>

      <title>Quarantesimo anniversario: lockdown reflections</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The Covid-19 disease pandemic has caused social and economic disruptions reminiscent of the colonial era.</p>
      <p>During the colonial era, draconian political curfews curtailed socio-economic activities. Zimbabwe attained her independence from the white settler regime on April 18, 1980.</p>
      <p>Independence did not come on a silver platter, but, was borne out of a protracted struggle, pitting nationalist movements on one side, against the racist Rhodesian forces.</p>
      <p>In 1886, rebellion against white settler occupation of the Zimbabwean land erupted. The era marked the beginning of the First Chimurenga.</p>
      <p>Chimurenga, also known as Umvukela in the Ndebele language, was a revolt against colonisation of Zimbabwe by the white settlers.</p>
      <p>Spiritual influences of Mlimo in the Matebeleland led to sporadic battles against the white settlers, and at a lightning speed, resistance spread to Mashonaland.</p>
      <p>Mbuya Nehanda, Sekuru Kaguvi and Mukwati spiritually led the Mashona rebellion against the occupation of arable land (51 percent) by the colonisers.</p>
      <p>The natives were confined to infertile lands (22 percent), where farming, the backbone of traditional economies was hampered.</p>
      <p>It took sophisticated weaponry and brutal war tactics for the white settlers to thwart sporadic and fierce battles waged by the natives.</p>
      <p>Mbuya Nehanda said, 'mapfupa angu achamuka' (my bones will rise again). And, true to her prophecy, the Second Chimurenga came to life in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>In 1965, the white settler regime, under the leadership of Ian Douglas Smith declared Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) from the British Government.</p>
      <p>The era marked fierce resistance from liberation war movements, who selflessly committed to liberating black people from colonialism.</p>
      <p>On 28 April, 1966, a group of seven liberation soldiers fought a fierce battle in Chinhoyi. The Chinhoyi Battle marked the beginning of a protracted struggle for political independence.</p>
      <p>Zanu and Zapu, the two main liberation war movements, operated from different fronts, fighting a common enemy.</p>
      <p>On 18 April, 1980, the Union Jack was lowered, paving way for the Zimbabwean flag. Prime Minister, Robert Gabriel Mugabe took custody of the country, marking the start of black majority rule.</p>
      <p>The new Government prioritised health for all, by putting in place sound health infrastructure across Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Richard Tren and Dr Roger Bate (2005) noted that 'between 1980 and 1987, health care spending increased by 80 percent.</p>
      <p>'Life expectancy rose from 54,9 years in 1980 to 63 years in 1988. Improvements in primary healthcare saw infant mortality rates falling by 80 percent by 1988.'</p>
      <p>Training of medical professionals improved significantly, with locals taking charge of the health delivery system.</p>
      <p>According to Woelk, G.B (1994): 'Zimbabwe had a thriving teaching hospital network, and a motivated, highly trained workforce.'</p>
      <p>At the turn of the millennium, Zimbabwe embarked on a land reform programme to correct colonial imbalances.</p>
      <p>Erstwhile former colonisers responded by placing an illegal economic embargo on the country.</p>
      <p>Economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe caused insufficient funding for healthcare, crippling the entire health delivery system.</p>
      <p>As a result, brain drain ensued, as medical practitioners sought greener pastures.</p>
      <p>Those who remained behind faced increased staff-patient ratios, poor remuneration and precarious work conditions.</p>
      <p>Sourcing of drugs from overseas suppliers became complicated. Equipment and infrastructure became obsolete, exposing vulnerable populations.</p>
      <p>Whilst battling illegal sanctions, Zimbabwe finds herself in a pandemic-induced lockdown. The Covid-19 disease outbreak has become a war within a war.</p>
      <p>To date, Zimbabwe has recorded 24 confirmed cases, 3 fatalities and a single recovery. The Government has initiated mass testing and screening of Covid-19 cases.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe celebrates her 40th birthday on April 18, 2020, albeit under quarantine.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, quaranta is an Italian word for 40, and 'Quarantesimo Anniversario' means 40th anniversary.</p>
      <p>In Christianity, 40 brings to fore issues such as 'repentance, newness, preparation, self-examination, task fulfilment, escape from bondage or slavery, growth, and personal fulfilment'.</p>
      <p>Israelites wandered in the desert for 40 years after fleeing the Egyptians (Numbers 32 vs 13), and manna rained on the Israelites for 40 years.</p>
      <p>And, in Islam, Muhammad was 40 years old when he first received 'the revelation delivered by the arch-angel Gabriel'.</p>
      <p>At 40, the country faces twin disasters of economic sanctions, and the dreadful pandemic. The toxic nexus poses unprecedented danger to Zimbabweans as a whole.</p>
      <p>However, the lockdown provides a window to reflect on reshaping the health sector, and call with one voice for the unconditional lifting of economic restrictions.</p>
      <p>Strategic envisioning is critical in creating strong health systems that withstand artificial and natural adversaries.</p>
      <p>In a global context, it is incumbent upon 'pseudo-super powers' to sober up, and appreciate the power of nature.</p>
      <p>Exodus 16 vs 18 says, 'So when they measured it by omers, he who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack.'</p>
      <p>The Bible teaches that all people are equal in the eyes of God. Blacks, whites, or coloureds, are all human populations, susceptible to the power of nature.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, reformation of the global body politic is nigh. In the true spirit of Chimurenga, unity of purpose is critical in mitigating challenges.</p>
      <p>Chimurenga battles provide pivotal references that encourage Zimbabweans to selflessly join in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>The unprecedented 21-day lockdown takes away socio-economic liberties, and call for a whole-society-approach in containing Covid-19 disease.</p>
      <p>Whole-of-societal approaches are a form of collaborative governance that can complement public policy. It entails engaging individuals, communities, civil society, and the private sector.</p>
      <p>However, agency is constrained by a plethora of factors. HIV/Aids, climate change and corruption exacerbate the situation.</p>
      <p>Today, as we reflect on Chimurenga, albeit under quarantine, Zimbabweans have a role to play in the struggle for socio-economic independence.</p>
      <p>At 40, Zimbabwe is at crossover to a better future. Interestingly, a typical pregnancy lasts 40 weeks. Some argue that life begins at 40.</p>
      <p>Together we shall overcome all adversaries. Stay at home, maintain social distancing, and keep washing your hands.</p>

      <title>Eliminate the other options</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Greatness is a choice! Make decisions and do not just state preferences, options and wishes. Develop meaningful plans, draw the line in the sand and explore your scenarios. Do yourself a favour by eliminating options, Plan B, Plan C and any other mediocre alternatives from your chosen path. Choose to be a professional player, not just a fan of your dreams. Decide that you will live in the world of your chosen dreams of greatness and not your distractions and optional excuses.</p>
      <p>In the game of greatness, you do not play according to your preferences and quit just because you are tired or its inconvenient to play. You do not resign because you face a tough opponent. Games are not played on the basis of conveniences, but commitment. Increase your work rate and your heart rate. Your heart-felt commitment makes all the difference.</p>
      <p>There is no space for Plan B in your greatness game. Make it a point to give yourself totally to whatever you are doing. There are no half-hearted champions in anything. Choose to be the first on the field and the last one to leave. Outplay and outstay your competition and opponents. Stop listening to people who feel pity for you and comfort you with mediocre low-bar standards.</p>
      <p>Decide and declare</p>
      <p>Decide, declare and do. The great boxer Ali did it. Before he was ever a champion boxer, he started telling people that he is a champion and 'The Greatest'. Many people said he talked too much and started calling him 'The Lip'. He was just activating a law: you decide to be a champion, you declare it and you work to become one and to stay on top of your game.</p>
      <p>The late Steve Jobs used to do it as wel. He would decide, declare it and then take giant steps towards his goal. Your words and decisions advertise your heart and character. You do not have the luxury of speaking like a loser when you are a champion.</p>
      <p>Decide, declare it and head into action with boldness. Elon Musk does it too. Strive Masiyiwa has been doing it. The champions I know do it. You also must be doing it if you are not yet doing it. Your words have power and you do not have the luxury of peppering them with doubt, negativity, bitterness and ambivalence. Decide and take action and keep taking action and ploughing against any obstacle that stands in your path. Do not wait for the right wind to blow, just set out towards your destination and decide on your journey.</p>
      <p>You strengthen your decision-making muscles by deciding and not just stating preferences, doing the comfortable and convenient things. A decision means cutting off all the other options and refusing to give up because the blows are hard. Your decisions are not based on the size of obstacles you face, but the depth of desire and extent of your vision. Stop looking for the easy way to greatness. You are a champion, not a gambler. It means that when you set your mind and heart towards something, you go for it. Just doing this moves you forward, strengthens your faith muscle and gives you a sense of lift and focus.</p>
      <p>Depending on luck</p>
      <p>Your life is not based on gambling (unless you are a casino owner), fate or some fetish, but on clear decisions and definite resolve. Eliminate from your mind and mouth secret prayers for luck and secret wishes for fate to follow you. Take definite steps and make clear decisions. Stop looking for charms to open a path for you. Stop doing senseless things that look like short cuts. Eliminate from your life superstitions of all kinds. In the book 'The Art of War', the strategic leader Sun Tsu advises: 'Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious doubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.' Head into action without fear, but with faith. Should you feel afraid, just do it afraid. Stop doing the things that give you luck and create your own luck through what you do. Engage the gear of faith and not the easy pedal of fate.</p>
      <p>Take charge</p>
      <p>If you do not take charge of your environment, your environment will take charge of you and control you. Refuse to be a mere 'remote control' of your conditions and environment. If you want to be great, quit all the victim nonsense. You may not control everything that happens to you and around you, but you can make a choice as to whether to control the environment or be controlled by it. Take charge of the environment around you, the thinking around you and the dialogue in you. Take control of your thoughts and what you choose to feed your mind with and base your conversations on. Stop feeding your mind with junk, and your soul with negativity. On the greatness lane you do not have the luxury of wasting time with distractions.</p>
      <p>Let anyone walk wherever they want, but refuse to let anyone walk through your mind with their dirty feet. Refuse to be part of negative conversations that leave you blind to opportunity and alive to evil. Take full control of your environment. Take charge and take responsibility. Take bold action, big moves and giant steps.</p>
      <p>Forget the past</p>
      <p>Forget and forgive the past. Do not be tied to the hurts, misses and losses of the past. Press stop and eject all toxic narratives that tie you to the past, disable you in the present and blind you from dreaming big. Choose to focus, forgive and forget the past. Forget past failures and start now. Renew your commitment to greatness. You may have failed in the past, but do not use that against yourself, do not hang it on your neck. Your job is to diligently navigate forward with resolve. You may veer off course, some accidents may happen along the way and you may lose a few things and friends along the way. It is part of the realities of the journey. Do not camp in the past, keep focused on your path of light. Correct what you need to. Keep working to make your declaration real. Shape your environment and make quality choices.</p>
      <p>Build sustaining structures</p>
      <p>Build empowering structures, partnerships and systems that keep you accountable and on the assertive move. For instance, getting a coach is a sign of commitment. Because you know you will have to pay, it increases your chance of commitment. You have always wanted to travel, then buy the ticket. Set up the board and start making moves. Commitment without action and accountability is an empty wish. Make your moves and build the structures around you to keep you moving.</p>
      <p>Decide, declare and take action. Commit to being a professional player who delivers at the highest level and not just a funny fan. A fan has options and can stay or quit whenever he wants. A professional player makes commitment, lives with pressure to deliver and does what needs to be done to influence the game and contribute fully. The player is on contract to deliver and uses prime time to prepare. The fun has no commitment beyond social affiliation and association. Be the most hardworking player you know. Be the most valuable player you know. Let your diligence shine forth. Decide, declare and do.</p>
      <p>Committed to your greatness.</p>

      <title>BIG COVID-19 DEBATE</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>AMID all the gloom and uncertainty brought by the coronavirus, which has crippled sport across the world, a silver lining has shone through the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and lower leagues as ZIFA and the league management body are working on mitigating the impact of the lockdown. This comes as the PSL's perennial sponsors, Delta Beverages, reaffirmed their commitment to continue bankrolling the elite league 'once everything returns to normal'. It has also emerged that ZIFA had already sought FIFA's assistance for all their affiliates before the world soccer governing body announced on Friday that they were advancing associations US$500 000 grants from the Forward Future Development Programme funding in order to blunt the impact of Covid-19.</p>
      <p>Zifa had earlier sought a bailout from Fifa understood to be just over US$2 million. If granted, it would be used to benefit junior football, the women's game and clubs from Division One up to the PSL.</p>
      <p>But the Premiership clubs, whose pre-season preparations had to be halted after the coronavirus outbreak, will have reason to smile after Delta indicated they would remain their biggest corporate partner.</p>
      <p>Just like most firms across the world, Delta Beverages are also feeling the negative economic effects of the deadly virus, but the company yesterday confirmed they will not waver on their sponsorship package for the Premiership.</p>
      <p>The company sponsors the championship, the Challenge Cup and Soccer Stars Awards through their premium brand, Castle Lager.</p>
      <p>They also bankroll the league's premier knockout competition, the Chibuku Super Cup. Delta Beverages were on the verge of announcing a fresh and improved deal for the PSL following the expiry of the latest deal at the end of the 2019 season when the Government announced a nationwide lockdown.</p>
      <p>The lockdown has since been extended by a further 14 days to May 3 to stop the spread of the disease. Delta Beverages marketing executive, Irimayi Muzorewa, yesterday told The Sunday Mail Sport his firm remained committed to sponsoring Zimbabwe's top-flight league. 'We have been on record as saying that we have already agreed in principle with PSL about the new sponsorship package.</p>
      <p>'What was left was just to sign a piece of paper, which is neither here nor there. That is still the position and when the time is ripe, we will be calling you to announce,' Muzorewa said.</p>
      <p>'Just like everybody, we have been affected as well. But we stand guided by the Government on the way forward.</p>
      <p>'We have no control to say the games should begin when because at the moment all the focus is on trying to get out of this problem. Right now the focus is on navigating the way out.'</p>
      <p>PSL clubs are presently grappling with the financial effects caused by the lockdown, which has meant a delayed start to the 2020 season. Under normal circumstances, the 2020 season would have been entering Week Six this weekend. A number of club representatives who spoke to The Sunday Mail Sport during the week expressed concern over the continued financial losses.</p>
      <p>Big clubs like Dynamos, Highlanders and CAPS United, which attract sizeable home crowds, would by now have pocketed at least a million dollars from gate takings.</p>
      <p>Bosso, which attracts an average of 9 000 fans at Barbourfields Stadium, would by now have raked in at least $1,3 million, based on a minimum gate fee of $50.</p>
      <p>But apart from the Delta's commitment, ZIFA president Felton Kamambo yesterday revealed that he had already applied for a relief fund to cushion the domestic game before FIFA doled out US$150 million to be shared among 211 member countries.</p>
      <p>The ZIFA president said they had written to all affiliates requesting them to table their requirements by Friday, the same day that FIFA indicated that each association would from this week receive US$500 000 from the $150 million payout.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the FIFA funding was part of what associations were due to receive later in the year under the Forward 2.0 programme.</p>
      <p>'This money we are going to receive is the same that we have been getting under Forward funds. In fact, we were due to receive it in July after meeting certain criteria, but FIFA have now said you can get it without meeting that criteria or any other conditions because they are aware of the complications brought about by lockdown in fulfilling some of the requirements,' said Kamambo.</p>
      <p>'But, as an affiliate, we had written to FIFA seeking assistance so that we can also get some relief to assist our own affiliates, and that is still in process as we had been asked to get the requirements of each of our affiliates.</p>
      <p>'So, it is not like what FIFA announced on Friday is the response to that Covid-19 relief fund, this one is only linked to Covid-19 in that the funding is coming without some conditions attached to it such as the need to first hold our AGM (annual general meeting), which we couldn't because of the pandemic,'' he said.</p>
      <p>ZIFA were expecting to receive some funds, Kamambo also added, from their drawdown from last year, which they had not yet accessed.</p>
      <p>'So from this US$500 000, no affiliate has been paid or is being paid but once we receive what we have applied for as relief fund, it will be definitely processed for the benefit of all our affiliates.</p>
      <p>'It is also important to highlight that the US$500 000 from FIFA is not for creditors. As ZIFA, we are aware of our obligations to our creditors and there is already a process that is underway with the assistance from FIFA to clear our longstanding debts,'' he said.</p>
      <p>The ZIFA boss, however, said their efforts to clear debts had also been hamstrung by some creditors who had been securing High Court writs to garnish their accounts.</p>
      <p>In a statement announcing the US$150 million bailout, FIFA confirmed that the funds were an advance payment of what was due to the associations for 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>'As part of the measure, all remaining entitlements of member associations to operational costs under the Forward 2.0 Programme will be released in full for the years 2019 and 2020.</p>
      <p>'In particular, the release of the second instalment of operational costs for 2020, which was originally due in July, will be paid immediately. Under normal circumstances, FIFA's member associations would have only received the full amount of the contribution upon fulfilment of specific criteria.</p>
      <p>'Instead, FIFA is now transferring this amount as an active support to help safeguard football across all member associations . . . This immediate financial assistance should be used to mitigate the financial impact of Covid-19 on football in member associations, namely to meet financial or operational obligations that they may have towards staff and other third parties,' read part of the statement. PSL chief executive Kenny Ndebele said while he understood the anxiety among the football community, there was need for patience by all stakeholders.</p>
      <p>'This Covid-19 pandemic is huge . . .</p>
      <p>'Social distancing and staying at home applies to everyone, including football players. The Government and the World Health Organisation will advise on each and every step to be taken until the situation is normal or a vaccine has been found.</p>
      <p>'So, at the moment, no one has the answer on what will happen. Let us just follow guidelines from the President of Zimbabwe,' Ndebele said. Dynamos chairperson Isaiah Mupfurutsa seemed to speak for most of the clubs when he indicated that teams are grappling with how they will recover money invested in the pre-season.</p>
      <p>Some clubs are reportedly mulling cost-cutting measures. Dynamos have so far spent an estimated $2 million on expenses such as salaries and pre-season programmes since January. 'This figure excludes signing-on fees. We are spending a lot of money on human resources who are not doing the actual job they are paid for.</p>
      <p>'Dynamos invested about half a million in pre-season training programmes, including player conditioning. All that money has gone to waste considering that we will obviously need to do another pre-season when the games finally commence,' Mupfurutsa said.</p>

      <title>Growing the alluring calatheas</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>FOR many garden enthusiasts, there is no other plant group that strikes much interest as the calatheas.</p>
      <p>Calatheas are tropical plants that prefer high temperatures and lots of humidity.</p>
      <p>Once settled they should not be moved unnecessarily. The group is popular for its array of foliage, which can be of different shades of colours. Thus a variety of common names like the zebra plant, rattle snake, peacock plant, cathedral plant and the prayer are testimony of the plant's beauty. This group of plants is originally from the tropical forest of Brazil.</p>
      <p>While the leaves are showy, most of the flowers are usually of insignificant aesthetic value. There are a number of calathea species such as c.lancifolia, c.ornata, c.roseopicta, c.rufibaraba, c.orbifolia and c.mackoyana.</p>
      <p>Although they are rather fussy plants, the results that one can get are worth the effort.</p>
      <p>The plants prefer light shade and dappled light indoors. Avoid direct sunlight as this will damage the leaves.</p>
      <p>Choose a good growing medium which is porous (well drained) but is able to retain enough moisture. Keep them medium moist in summer but slightly dry in winter.</p>
      <p>A good growing medium can be well-rotted organic matter mixed with river sand.</p>
      <p>Ensure that excess water drains away to avoid bacterial and fungal infections.</p>
      <p>The plant is also commonly attacked by mites and scale. Regularly fertilise the plants with liquid fertiliser throughout the growing season.</p>
      <p>Calatheas can easily be propagated from divisions. Repot the plant every year into a fresh potting.</p>
      <p>When growing calatheas, try to maintain a regular routine in all the practices you undertake. Fluctuations in temperature, watering regime and moving the plants unnecessarily will result in leaf drop.</p>
      <p>When spraying, try a small portion of the plant and wait for a day or two to see the effect the spray had on the plant.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, spray the whole plant or plants of the same family. Other problem areas include the wrong pot size and mixing the plant with other plants in the same pot, which may not have the same growing requirements.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, calatheas like the African violet will reward good care.</p>
      <p>Their growth is relatively slow, so some patience is required.</p>
      <p>No pruning is required except to remove dead brown leaves.</p>

      <title>America - the paragon of democratic decadence</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It's that season again in America when political contestation exposes the downside of the West and perforates the myth of cultural finesse and spruced up candour.</p>
      <p>It's is such a spectacle for us the people of the South to watch how America - the so-called paragon of virtue that prides itself of a matured democracy taking us back to a bygone era of racial bigotry and othering.</p>
      <p>And who else than President Trump to parade this sort of backwardness? Through words and deeds, Trump has dragged America to its unpalatable past of racial prejudice that fuelled slavery and Jim Crow laws.</p>
      <p>For all in tense and purpose, President Trump seems to revel in the absurdity of name calling opponents and unashamedly propounding the narrative of 'birtherism'.</p>
      <p>'Birtherism' refers to the aspersions cast against Barak Obama's birth place during the 2016 elections campaign.</p>
      <p>Trump made orchestrated allegations that the then American President had forged his birth certificate and that he was born in Africa. All this was later proven untrue.</p>
      <p>His recent tweets against three congresswomen of colour smirk reflects the mind-set of an individual still stuck in the Antiquity era when white supremacy reigned supreme and was the instrument applied to discriminate, oppress and subjugate other races.</p>
      <p>The four congresswomen fired back at President Trump last Monday after he tweeted that they should 'go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.' All four democratic lawmakers are American citizens and only Rep. Ilhan Omar was born outside of the US before becoming a citizen in 2000.</p>
      <p>In a language unbecoming of a nation that prides itself as a model of democratic etiquette and is given to lecturing other countries on acceptable tenets of political candour, President Trump shot back saying the women were 'anti-America' and a 'bunch of communists.'</p>
      <p>President Trump has previously accused Mexicans of 'bringing drugs, crime and rapists.' He once accused us District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana, of being biased because his parents emigrated from Mexico.</p>
      <p>Last year, during a meeting with senators on immigration, President Trump questioned his country's acceptance of people from 'sh*thole countries,' adding that the us should bring in people from places like 'Norway'.</p>
      <p>It seems inviting charges of racism has become a staple of Mr Trump's presidency and he is not even ashamed of it as he once remarked during an interview in 2016 that: 'I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters. It's like incredible.'</p>
      <p>So as Africans, who for years have been labelled primitive and lacking decorum and having 'sh*thole' countries; how do we make of Trump's rather uncivilised comments? Well, for once it demystifies the very basis for 'othering' people on the basis of racial superiority and geographical birthplace. It also debunks the whole essence of America as the quintessential democracy.</p>
      <p>It puts into question some local opposition parties that look up to America as a model country worth aping in terms of how its representatives conduct themselves in the public arena. It makes us question all the things America have said against Africa and Zimbabwe in particular given how vile and repugnant their President is.</p>
      <p>We notice rather unsettling traits in some of our local politicians. Tendai Biti, Job Sikhala and the excitable gaffe-prone Nelson Chamisa are names that quickly come to mind.</p>
      <p>President Trump must know that despite its sordid history of slavery; America remains an inspirational country whose conduct reverberates across the world.</p>
      <p>Sadly, most observers see a decline in democratic credentials mostly attributed to America.</p>
      <p>There is resonation to what is happening in America to what is captured in 'The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,' by Edward Gibbon who melodramatically conjures the Rome of 408 ad, when armies of the Goths primed to descend upon the city. The symbols of imperial decadence appeared not only in ludicrous displays of public opulence and waste, but also the collapse of faith in reason and science.</p>
      <p>The people of Rome, Gibbon writes, fell prey to 'puerile superstition' promoted by astrologers and to soothsayers who claimed 'to read in the entrails of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity.'</p>
      <p>Would latter-day Gibbon describe today's America as 'decadent'? I think the shoe fits.</p>
      <p>As aptly captured by James Traub, a regular contributor to Foreign Policy, a fellow at the Centre on International Co-operation and the author of 'John Quincy Adams: Militant Spirit', perhaps in a democracy the distinctive feature of decadence is not debauchery but terminal self-absorption.</p>
      <p>In an article published on https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/12/19/ titled 'The United States of America Is Decadent and Depraved,' Traub argues that the problem isn't Donald Trump - it's the Donald Trump in all of Americans.</p>
      <p>'We listen to necromancers who prophesy great things while they lead us into disaster. We sneer at the idea of 'public' and hold our fellow citizens in contempt. We think anyone who doesn't pursue self-interest is a fool,' says Traub.</p>
      <p>Indeed, as Traub points out, we cannot heap everything on President Trump. In the decadent stage of the Roman Empire, or Louis XVI's France, or the dying days of the Habsburg Empire so brilliantly captured in Robert Musil's 'The Man Without Qualities', decadence seeped downward from rulers to the ruled. But in a democracy the process happens in a reciprocal manner. A decadent elite certificates degraded behaviour, and a corrupted public chooses its worst leaders. And in our case - our Nero panders to our worst attributes- and we reward him for doing so.</p>
      <p>Judging from President's Trump disposition, no one doubts the decadence that today afflicts America. The cultural, moral and spiritual disorder including the sheer arrogance in ignorance exemplified by President Trump is there for everyone to see.</p>
      <p>There is apparent civilisational decay that has creeped into the American political discourse to embarrassing to imagine. A democratic society becomes decadent when its politics - when its essential means of judgement becomes morally and intellectually corrupt.</p>
      <p>And last but not least, a naughty journalist asked Trump about his Africa policy in general and Zimbabwe in particular and how the sanctions imposed on it are hamstringing the country's prospects for economic recovery.</p>
      <p>Trump's response; 'We are looking at Zimbabwe right now.' That's it and moves on as quickly as possible. And afterwards people had a field day commenting about President Trump's incapacity to discuss policy matters. Some taunted that at least he didn't call the country Rhodesia while others imitated his usual brash statement; 'I am still looking into it. We'll see what happens.'</p>
      <p>Others went balderdash saying if the reporter had queried further, President Trump was likely to say that, 'Our Zimbabwe policy is great. Really great. Some people would say unbelievable.'</p>
      <p>This is something that all those who worship America must reflect upon.</p>

      <title>Premiums bite harder as cash shortages persist</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>While premiums paid to access cash have dropped from the lofty levels of around 50 percent prior to the injection of additional cash in November last year, they remain high at 30 percent due to the acute shortage of cash.</p>
      <p>This comes amid unconfirmed reports that the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is mulling to inject higher denominations of $10, $20 and $50 notes.</p>
      <p>This might effectively deal with the chronic problem of cash shortages as well as challenges presented by high inflation.</p>
      <p>Sources said in the near future, the central bank will start printing the money given that the higher denominations will require extra care to ensure that adequate security features are inserted on them.</p>
      <p>Currently, notes are being imported.</p>
      <p>But there are fears that unrestrained cash injections, as was the case around 2008, will drive inflation.</p>
      <p>However, Government and the central bank have allayed the fears. The RBZ is on record as saying that cash will be injected cautiously in line with market needs.</p>
      <p>With the first batch of the new notes having been released onto the market late last year, unscrupulous dealers continue to milk desperate customers of their hard-earned money by charging steep premiums for cash.</p>
      <p>The RBZ's drip-feeding remains painstakingly slow.</p>
      <p>Economic analysts believe that at the rate at which the cash is being injected into the economy, the country may fail to completely resolve its cash shortages this year.</p>
      <p>The situation is being worsened by the fact that the targeted ideal amount of cash in circulation is a moving target given that it is a percentage of total deposits, including foreign currency.</p>
      <p>However, this target is shifting each time there is a movement in the exchange rate.</p>
      <p>Harare economist Mr Brains Muchemwa noted that the quantum of cash relative to electronic balances remains disproportionately low at below 10 percent.</p>
      <p>He said this is sustaining the punitive premiums on the sale of cash.</p>
      <p>'On account of the prevalence of the informal sector and low confidence levels in the banking sector, physical cash as a percentage of electronic balances should be upwards of 25 percent in order to satisfy depositors' requirements,' he said.</p>
      <p>This also comes as parallel market activities such as foreign currency trading have continued to fuel irregular transfers of cash from banks and retail shops to illegal dealers, thereby worsening the prevailing cash shortages.</p>
      <p>lndividuals' demand for cash is driven by the informal markets' discounted cash prices. Harare's downtown tuckshops, for example, charge lower cash prices for most basic commodities.</p>
      <p>Investigations established that the tuckshops are using this strategy to mop up cash and buy foreign currency on the black market.</p>
      <p>Last week, the central bank said during 2019's last quarter, it injected $150 million into the market. This money was expected to eliminate cash shortages and cash premiums.</p>
      <p>'As per normal banking practice, these funds were sold to local banks for distribution to clients in exchange for RTGS balances, so as to neutralise any expansion of money supply and, therefore, inflation,' the RBZ said.</p>
      <p>However, it seems like the bulk of that money found its way to cash barons as individuals in need of cash are still having to pay premiums to access it.</p>
      <p>Economist Mr Eddie Cross said the central bank needs to inject more cash into the market. He believes that the country had a long way to go in eliminating the prevailing cash shortages.</p>
      <p>'When the Monetary Policy Committee was formed in October last year, one of our first discussions was on cash. At the time, the premium on cash was about 50 percent. We authorised importation of $400 million cash in $2 and $5 notes.</p>
      <p>'So far, $150 million has been released. We have been supplying the banks on demand. So the problem is that the banks have not taken up the entire $400 million,' said Mr Cross.</p>
      <p>However, by mid-year, the RBZ intends to have injected new notes and coins worth $500 million.</p>
      <p>For proper functionality, an economy requires cash in circulation of between 10 and 15 percent of the broad money supply.</p>
      <p>Mr Cross said given that Zimbabwe's markets are highly digitalised, 10 percent can suffice for the country's needs.</p>
      <p>The RBZ said as of now, there is $1,1 billion cash in circulation. This is against total bank deposits of $34,5 billion. Therefore, only 3,2 percent of the amount of money on the market is cash, which falls short of demand.</p>
      <p>Authorities have indicated that their target is to increase cash in circulation to 10 percent of total deposits. Therefore, at least $3,4 billion cash is required at the moment to satisfy the current demand for cash.</p>
      <p>Mr Cross revealed that at its next meeting, the RBZ's Monetary Policy Committee will discuss ways of increasing cash in circulation with a view to ending shortages as well as the cash barons' premiums.</p>

      <title>Uniform shops dig-in on prices</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Schools open this Tuesday amid a continued dig-in by shops selling uniforms at exorbitant prices tantamount to charging in the United States dollar or its equivalent black market rate of bond notes or RTGS.</p>
      <p>Most people buying complete sets of school uniforms for pupils starting ECD, Grade One and Form One have over the past three weeks raised concern over the sharp increases in the school clothes as they part with not less than $500.</p>
      <p>A survey by The Sunday Mail in major shops yesterday showed that prices were pegged on a three tier model. Government has been trying to dissuade businesses from effecting such pricing regimes.</p>
      <p>Before the price increase last year, a pair of school shoes was priced at $16 while a satchel was pegged at $11, with a shirt and short selling for $14, dress ($15), trousers ($20) blazer ($30), hat ($6), pair of socks ($3) and a tie $5.</p>
      <p>Latest prices in school shops such as Enbee, Nargaji and Bays pegged a pair of shoes at between $60 and $110, while a pair of trousers cost $65, shirt ($50), blazer ($200), hat (18) pair of socks ($7) and a tie ($10)</p>
      <p>Informal traders were selling a blazer at $120, jersey $30, trousers $35, tie $15, shirts $25, shorts $20, shoes between $40 and $104.</p>
      <p>Some shoppers interviewed said a lasting solution to the school uniform pricing 'madness' could be an introduction of a universal set of school wear.</p>
      <p>One parent said Government should explore the idea of introducing a standard uniform with a notable difference being on school badges or logos.</p>
      <p>Another parent Mrs Muchaneta Chasara from Budiriro who was seen buying uniforms for her children starting form one and grade one said it was high time Government faced the reality that prices are now being pegged in US dollars.</p>
      <p>'Government should intervene and recognise the values of the different currencies so that prices stabilise,' she said.</p>
      <p>'The reality is that we are now in the United States dollar regime and Government must let the market regulate itself so that people holding the foreign currency begin to use it.</p>
      <p>'There is no way a person will get into a shop and buy a product pegged at $10 for bond or RTGS and then pay in US dollars. It is unrealistic.'</p>
      <p>It is also understood that some parents are opting to engage tailors who are also buying a metre of cloth for between $4 and $7 up from about $1,50 per metre.</p>

      <title>Mega bash for Tuku memorial… Selmor missing in action, again</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>HE is gone, but definitely not forgotten.</p>
      <p>On September 22 this year, he would have turned 67.</p>
      <p>As had become the norm since his mammoth 60th birthday bash in 2012 - something big would have been brewing by now.</p>
      <p>Dinners locally and abroad, a national tour, an exclusive family celebration, a big public birthday bash and sometimes even a new album - the late national hero Dr Oliver 'Tuku' Mtukudzi's birthday celebrations had become a huge commercial venture.</p>
      <p>His brand had overtaken the man, which is why he would let everyone have a piece of the cake. Now, even in death, he continues to be a gold mine and to attract all the big names.</p>
      <p>On September 27, Mi Casa of South Africa, Zambian artistes Amayenge and James Sakala, local heavyweights Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah and Winky D will serenade revellers at the Glamis Arena in honour of the departed legend.</p>
      <p>Diana Samkange, on-fire Enzo Ishall, evergreen Tocky Vibes, Zim dancehall bad boy Soul Jah Love and Black Spirits will also take part in the gala, which has been dubbed, 'Tuku Memorial Concert and Birthday Celebration'.</p>
      <p>The late superstar's widow Daisy Mtukudzi, Black Spirits manager Walter Wanyanya and promoters Partson Chimbodza of Chipaz Promotions and Taka Mashonganyika are behind the gig.</p>
      <p>However, it is Selmor's absence on the line-up that has raised some eyebrows and is threatening to put a damper on the affair.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when Selmor staged her own father's memorial gig in late March, her team had a difficult time convincing some top local artistes to support her owing to the burning family squabbles.</p>
      <p>Selmor is the late Tuku's musically gifted daughter largely touted as the heiress to her legendary father's music legacy.</p>
      <p>One of the September gig promoters, Partson Chimbodza aka Chipaz, said he, together with other promoters were simply carrying on with the tradition they started seven years ago when they did the Tuku @ 60 gig. He said just like in previous years, they had ensured that the line-up is top-notch with the crème-de-la-crème of local performers as well as those from the region.</p>
      <p>Chipaz said as promoters behind the gig they had approached Selmor but had been informed that she had other commitments. The Sunday Mail Society spoke to Selmor's sister-cum-manager, Sandra, who confirmed that they would be out of the country on September 27, thus her band is unable to take part in the event.</p>
      <p>'We are not available on that date. We are booked elsewhere, we won't be in the country,' said Sandra, adding, 'We are booked till November.'</p>
      <p>Asked if Selmor would have performed at the gig had she been around on September 27, Sandra said, 'Definitely. We would want to do anything for our father. Anything to do with our father we would want to take part. But obviously, anything to do with our father has to be initiated by the family. This is our father, why would we not want to honour him?'</p>
      <p>Sandra also confirmed that she was indeed contacted by one of the organisers and she explained the band's predicament to them.</p>
      <p>'Taka Mashonganyika contacted me and I explained to him that we are booked and also what procedures he should take for such a thing to happen. I told him if it's anything to do with our dad, family has got to be involved,' said Sandra.</p>
      <p>Dr Mtukudzi died on January 23 at a Harare hospital, leaving his family largely in disarray. A large part of his family did not attend his memorial held on April 6 in Madziva while issues of inheritance threatened peace in the family until a Will surfaced declaring his widow, Daisy, the sole beneficiary of the estate.</p>
      <p>There has been drama on the music side with Selmor performing with a band called the Original Black Spirits while Daisy continues to run another Black Spirits, the last instrumentalists and backing vocalists to play with Tuku.</p>
      <p>Artistes like Pakare Paye Arts Centre-groomed Mbeu have also been sucked into the family squabbles for appearing to be too eager to take the mantle and carry on with Tuku's legacy. Surprisingly though, Mbeu, who has led the Black Spirits on many occasions locally and abroad since Tuku's passing, is not on the September 27 line-up. This development has led to speculation with regards to leadership of the Black Spirits, particularly at this forthcoming high-profile gig.</p>
      <p>Could it be Daisy herself or her daughter Samantha, who has been with the band since 2016? Only time will tell.</p>

      <title>New malaria vector hits Africa</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A species of mosquito that can carry malaria - known as Anopheles stephensi - has invaded eastern Africa and is quickly moving across the region.</p>
      <p>How did Anopheles stephensi come to Africa?</p>
      <p>This mosquito species is widespread in South-East Asia and parts of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
      <p>It is common in India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>In the last couple of years there have been increasing reports of it in Africa.</p>
      <p>It was initially reported in Djibouti in 2013.</p>
      <p>Recent reports indicate that it is spreading rapidly through the Horn of Africa.</p>
      <p>It was reported in Ethiopia in 2016 and in Sudan in 2017 and is likely being spread along major transportation routes.</p>
      <p>As a result, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued an alert for intensified surveillance to track the spread.</p>
      <p>We expect that it will eventually be found in other major African cities.</p>
      <p>Surveillance data is needed to confirm further spread but, based on the timeline of its travel to Ethiopia and Sudan, we speculate that three years is how long it would have taken to reach Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
      <p>They are now within that risky time-frame.</p>
      <p>Kenya and Tanzania may be at a particularly high risk due to their close proximity to the Horn of Africa. They also have large coastal cities whose weather conditions (warmer and more humid) are similar to the mosquitoes' native range.</p>
      <p>Other cities further away, including some in West Africa, are deemed to have a suitable environment for Anopheles stephensi.</p>
      <p>Generally the spread of mosquitoes to new areas is facilitated by people through ground, air and ocean transport systems.</p>
      <p>Increased international travel and human migration leads to vectors and pathogens emerging or re-emerging in regions where they had diminished or been eradicated.</p>
      <p>Unique</p>
      <p>There are over 100 species of Anopheles mosquitoes in Africa, but only six species are considered 'primary' vectors of malaria.</p>
      <p>Anopheles stephensi is very effective at transmitting malaria. What is worrying is that it thrives in urban areas, unlike the various African Anopheles species.</p>
      <p>Anopheles mosquitoes require water to complete their life cycle: a female mosquito lays its eggs on the surface of a water source, where they hatch and finally develop into adult mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>Female mosquitoes suck blood from people and other hosts to enable them to lay eggs.</p>
      <p>It is the blood-feeding that enables mosquitoes to transmit parasites - such as malaria - from one person to another.</p>
      <p>Typically, the main African Anopheles vector species are found in rural landscapes, which is why the majority of Africa's malaria cases are also in rural areas.</p>
      <p>They breed in various water habitats such as puddles, footprints and hoof prints along the edges of ponds and irrigated farmland.</p>
      <p>These habitats do occur in some urban areas, but they are often polluted and less suitable for these mosquitoes. Reports do now indicate, though, that some African Anopheles are becoming more adapted to these conditions.</p>
      <p>By contrast, while they can also survive in rural areas, Anopheles stephensi thrive in urban areas - such as plastic and cement containers that hold water. This means that this species poses a threat both in cities and in rural areas.</p>
      <p>New challenges</p>
      <p>The main issue is that if the invasion becomes widely established, malaria could become more prevalent in African cities and this would put many more people at risk of infection.</p>
      <p>Consequently, malaria control efforts will be spread even thinner on the continent as malaria expands into cities.</p>
      <p>There are already many challenges such as a lack of resources.</p>
      <p>Currently, about half of the US$6,5 billion needed to meet the 2030 malaria targets is available. There were an estimated 219 million cases of malaria in 2017 and 92 percent of these occurred in the WHO African region.</p>
      <p>The funding shortfall is likely to grow if the Anopheles stephensi increases malaria cases in Africa.</p>
      <p>Another major challenge is that both Anopheles stephensi and African malaria vectors are developing resistance to some of the insecticides used against them.</p>
      <p>These insecticides are deployed on bed-nets or used for indoor spraying.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Anopheles stephensi presents a new challenge because it is harder to access mosquito breeding and resting sites in urban areas and deploy control measures.</p>
      <p>In particular, it is more challenging to identify and map breeding sites in urban areas, which makes it more difficult to control larvae. In addition, indoor residual spraying is less straightforward due to the high density of dwellings and challenges accessing them all.</p>
      <p>Precedent</p>
      <p>The spread of Anopheles stephensi is reminiscent of a similar invasion by Anopheles gambiae, a mosquito species commonly found in Africa, which spread to Brazil in the 1930s and 1940s and caused devastating malaria outbreaks. For example, over a period of just eight months there were 150 000 cases of malaria and 14 000 deaths.</p>
      <p>This was recognised as one of the most serious threats to health in the Americas and an aggressive eradication campaign was initiated.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian government reacted with an integrated control programme.</p>
      <p>Insecticide spraying targeted larvae and adult insects. Cars or trucks leaving endemic areas were sprayed and there was a massive effort to improve drainage and remove the stagnant water that provided breeding sites.</p>
      <p>This concerted effort is an important example in successful vector control and resulted in the species being eradicated in South America by the 1940s.</p>
      <p>Stopping the spread</p>
      <p>Action is needed immediately if there is to be a chance of curtailing the spread of Anopheles stephensi. The longer we leave it the harder it will be to contain, and unfortunately there seems to have already been significant spread with reports from across the Horn of Africa.</p>
      <p>Though mosquitoes can travel long distances and are dispersed on high altitude winds, the pattern of Anopheles stephensi spread suggests the importance of human transportation routes.</p>
      <p>Vector surveillance is key.</p>
      <p>We need to know where Anopheles stephensi has spread and then quickly and strategically focus resources on restricting spread and locally eliminating Anopheles stephensi before it establishes a foothold. Surveillance should be carried out by National Vector and Malaria Control Programmes with support from research institutions. Overall, a combination of environmental management to eliminate larval habitats and eco-friendly biopesticides to control adult and larval stages of the mosquito is considered the most effective strategy for control of Anopheles stephensi.</p>
      <p>Other appropriate interventions include: use of long-lasting insecticide treated nets, screening of houses to stop entry by adult mosquitoes, proper covering of water storage containers to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in them, and removal of any unused water receptacles that may offer suitable breeding habitat to mosquitoes.</p>

      <title>Road upgrades gather pace</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE modernisation of major roads, particularly the much-talked about Harare-Beitbridge highway, is gathering pace after Government officials met Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Corporation (AFECC) representatives last week to discuss the company's preparedness to construct one of Africa's busiest highways.</p>
      <p>Further, Government has short-listed 85 companies to modernise 20 other critical highways, including the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls road, and the Birchenough Bridge. The Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway has attracted a staggering 16 bidders.</p>
      <p>Some of the world's well-heeled firms short-listed to modernise the highways include China State Engineering Company Limited and China Railway Number 3 Engineering Group.</p>
      <p>Government wants the short-listed firms to submit technical and financial proposals for the feasibility study of the upgrading, construction and tolling of the roads and bridges through public private partnerships (PPPs). Deadline for submission of proposals is tomorrow.</p>
      <p>In his address at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly last week, President Mnangagwa reiterated his Government's desire to modernise roads and other key infrastructure.</p>
      <p>'The development and modernisation of our roads, railways, airports, energy and ICT infrastructure is being accelerated in line with our regional and continental quest for enhanced connectivity and integrated infrastructure,' said President Mnangagwa.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, Deputy Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Advocate Fortune Chasi told The Sunday Mail Business that Government wants the modernisation of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway undertaken as soon as yesterday.</p>
      <p>'We are (still) trying to understand the intricacies of existing arrangements and also looking at other possible funding models that will give the country the best deal,' said Adv Chasi.</p>
      <p>'Since we came into office, we haven't spoken to any outsiders concerning that project. We engaged in a process of extracting information from our staff concerning the way forward. But our non-negotiable position is that we want works to begin yesterday; that is what we are working on.</p>
      <p>'Our major concern is that works must start as soon as is reasonably practical. We cannot continue to wait and watch when nothing is happening.'</p>
      <p>Senior AFECC officials are understood to have met Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister, Engineer Joel Biggie Matiza, last Thursday and spoke at length about the construction of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the meeting said AFECC officials were instructed to go and prepare their proposal.</p>
      <p>AFECC came back into the equation after Government cancelled Geiger International's contract to construct the Harare-Beitbridge Highway following two years of inactivity.</p>
      <p>Geiger International had its tender approved by Government in 2015, and commissioned the project in May 2016 at Chatsworth, along the Harare-Masvingo Highway. However, nothing took place, prompting the withdrawal of the contract.</p>
      <p>Cabinet then directed AFECC, whose bid had come second to Geiger's, to review the terms and conditions set out by the Austrian firm. AFECC immediately summoned its technicians to study the project. Sources close to AFECC said the company has since reviewed its position and submitted it to the Ministry of Transport last week. The proposal entails modernisation of the entire highway that cuts across Zimbabwe, from Beitbridge to Chirundu.</p>
      <p>'They are now waiting for feedback from Government, but I can tell you that they have agreed to adopt a Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) model in the implementation of the Harare-Beitbridge section, which is the first phase of the project.</p>
      <p>'They will then adopt EPC (Engineering, Procuring and Construction) and financing model for the Harare-Chirundu section, which will be in the second phase. If that position is accepted, they will go ahead to sign a Framework Agreement, a Concession Agreement and other necessary agreements which are required for such a big project. But on the whole, I see an agreement being struck in the near future because Government wants this project to be implemented soon,' explained the source.</p>
      <p>However, it is not yet clear how the project will be undertaken given that there were concerns in the past that dualising the entire 585km highway was not viable considering that only between 2 500 and 3 000 vehicles use the highway daily. Fears are that it will take longer for contractors to recover their investment.</p>
      <p>Geiger had estimated the project to cost US$1,7 billion, with the dualisation of the Harare-Beitbridge Highway alone gobbling US$998 million while the cost for the Harare ring-road was pegged at US$300 million. The Harare-Chirundu Road section was estimated to cost US$665 million.</p>
      <p>The US$998 million loan for the Harare-Beitbridge section was expected to be repaid over 20 years from toll fees.</p>
      <p>Some contractors proposed dualising the Harare to Chivhu section, areas approaching towns and steep gradients, with other sections only being widened. But Adv Chasi said Government had not insisted that it (highway) must be dualised all the way. South Africa's N1 Highway (Beitbridge to Johannesburg) is only dualised as it approaches towns, just like the Chirundu-Lusaka highway.</p>
      <p>While Adv Chasi said he could not say who will win the contract 'because we haven't got to that point at all', sources believe AFECC will land the project.</p>
      <p>AFECC, a Chinese large-scale multi-operational entity set up in 1992, has been one of the top investors in Zimbabwe since the land reform programme. It has constructed the Zimbabwe National Defence University and Longcheng Plaza in Harare, the Golden Peacock Hotel in Mutare, and owns another Golden Peacock Hotel in Harare's leafy suburb of Borrowdale. The two hotels employ about 170 locals while hundreds more work at Longcheng Plaza.</p>
      <p>Other key road projects</p>
      <p>Government also wants other investors to construct the Karoi-Binga-Dete road. Four investors have been short-listed for the project. The Mount Darwin-Mukumbura road has attracted one bidder while the Mvurwi-Guruve-Kanyemba road has three companies shortlisted .</p>
      <p>China Geo-Engineering Corporation is battling it out with six other firms for the Kwekwe-Nkayi-Lupane road, and is also interested in the Golden Valley-Sanyati-Kuwirirana-Nembudziya road, in which it will contest against Epic Financial LLC.</p>
      <p>Ten companies, including China State Construction Engineering Co. Ltd, Masimba Tencraft Prostruct Consortium and China Railway Number 3 Engineering Group, are vying for the Harare-Bindura road. ALW-Team Investments (Pvt) Ltd, owned by Mr Timothy Mncube, a Zimbabwean based in South Africa, is battling it out with two other companies for the Bulawayo-Nkayi road.</p>
      <p>Sino Hydro Corporation Ltd is slugging it out with three other companies for the upgrading of the Birchenough Bridge where vehicles going in different directions are now taking turns to pass.</p>

      <title>US$1bn infrastructure fund takes shape</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The establishment of a US$1 billion infrastructure development fund by the Infrastructure Development Bank of Zimbabwe (IBDZ) and Hondius Capital Management of the US, is now imminent after the parties signed an agreement that will govern operations of an escrow account, a senior official has revealed.</p>
      <p>This is part of conditions set out in the global agreement signed between IDBZ and Hondius last October to facilitate the establishment of the fund.</p>
      <p>The process had been delayed by foreign currency shortages but the ball is rolling now. IDBZ chief executive Mr Thomas Sakala told The Sunday Mail Business this week that the Memorandum of Agreement contains pre-requisites for Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>'A key pre-condition for Hondius to proceed with preparation of the necessary documentation for the establishment of the fund was an obligation placed upon the IDBZ to establish a jointly operated escrow account in a local commercial bank.</p>
      <p>'The establishment of the escrow account would trigger all the other processes within the agreement. After considerable delays due to forex challenges, the process of opening the escrow account has picked up momentum and is now before the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for necessary approvals in line with the country's exchange control regulations.</p>
      <p>'A reputable commercial bank to act as the escrow agent has already been agreed upon between the IDBZ and Hondius, and both parties have since signed the escrow agreement governing the operation of the escrow account,' Mr Sakala added.</p>
      <p>The IDBZ chief said the next step would be the setting up of a local special purpose vehicle to carry out the fund's operations.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Hondius would establish an offshore vehicle through which global investors would invest in Zimbabwean projects. The process involves formulation of institutional, operational and governing frameworks for the fund.</p>
      <p>The funds raised under the arrangement will be channelled towards priority infrastructure and other developmental projects. The agreement commits Government, through the IDBZ, to contribute US$200 million or its local currency equivalent towards capitalisation of the fund, with Hondius mobilising the remaining US$800 million in capital from global institutional investors.</p>
      <p>The funds raised offshore will be blended with the capital contributed by Government to finance the development and implementation of high impact infrastructure projects in energy, water and sanitation, agriculture and mining, among others.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe has an estimated infrastructure backlog of $30 billion, according to the Africa Development Bank. Between 2009 and 2016, the Government spent only $2 billion on infrastructure projects, the amount analysts say should have been spent on an annual basis.</p>
      <p>The huge debt overhang and arrears to multi-lateral financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank also made it difficult for the country to raise long term capital critical for infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p>In the absence of significant lines of credit from multi-lateral financial institutions, Zimbabwe has been operating on a tight budget, with the bulk of revenue going towards paying wages, leaving it with little or virtually no money for infrastructure.</p>

      <title>Expectations from Gov</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Over the last two decades, Zimbabwe has suffered massive economic decline which has seen it being entrenched into structural rigidities with the following ugly fundamentals, among others:</p>
      <p>Pervasive formal unemployment;</p>
      <p>Dilapidated infrastructure;</p>
      <p>Weak production base;</p>
      <p>Narrowing export base and increasing import bill of finished goods and basic agricultural products;</p>
      <p>Collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar;</p>
      <p>Cash challenges;</p>
      <p>Unfavourable business environment;</p>
      <p>Decay of the social fabric;</p>
      <p>High levels of poverty and worrying stunted growth, especially in the rural areas.</p>
      <p>The essence of this article is to highlight the basic minimum requirements which must be taken into consideration by Government if we are to address the challenges we are facing.</p>
      <p>These minimum requirements inter alia should include the establishment of a lean and pragmatic cabinet, reforms on State owned enterprises, fast track business reforms and development of a national development plan.</p>
      <p>Lean and pragmatic cabinet</p>
      <p>ministers</p>
      <p>The President must appoint a lean cabinet with ministers who have a track record of experience in the field linked to their portfolios. The same must apply to permanent secretaries.</p>
      <p>Appointments on the basis of political consideration at the expense of merit should be the thing of the past. The world over, governments place their best experts in various sectors of the economy in strategic key positions in government. This is the approach the new Government should take.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the success of the Government in addressing the challenges faced by the country today depends on the calibre of men and women in Government. I am confident that President Mnangagwa will appoint the best team to take us to Canaan.</p>
      <p>National development plan</p>
      <p>In order to achieve the middle-income status, the Government must come up with a National Development Plan Vision 2030.</p>
      <p>This plan must clearly articulate how we will get there in a logical and pragmatic way. The development of the plan must be inclusive and consultative.</p>
      <p>lt must tape into the brains of Zimbabwean experts - think tanks, academia, civil society and the business community.</p>
      <p>The plan must not be a party thing, it should be a national project.</p>
      <p>Reforms around doing business and State-owned enterprises</p>
      <p>The World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Index rates Zimbabwe number 126 out of 138 in terms of ease of doing business. The World Bank rates Zimbabwe number 161 out of 190.</p>
      <p>Heritage Foundation Index of Economic Freedom rates Zimbabwe number 175 out of 178 and Transparency International Corruption Perception rates Zimbabwe number 154 out of 175.</p>
      <p>These positions have consistently remained at the same level over the years.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the positions in global rating inhibit capital from moving in or domestic capital mobilization to take place.</p>
      <p>It is important for Zimbabwe to work hard to achieve the ranking of its peers, that is, Rwanda, Mauritius and South Africa, which are in the top 50.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe is open for business mantra must get louder now that elections have come and gone.</p>
      <p>As part of the National Development Plan, Government must expedite reforms on doing business and State-owned enterprises.</p>

      <title>MDC-Alliance's orgy of violence</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Around 8am on Tuesday, Lewis Marimo (not his real name) dodges a pelt of stones as he navigates a makeshift barricade at the intersection of High Glen Road and First Street near Kuwadzana, Harare.</p>
      <p>Behind, in feisty pursuit, is a pack of marauding hoodlums throwing stones, waving wooden sticks and shouting obscenities. Putting a foot wrong would result in Marimo losing his vehicle and even his life.</p>
      <p>'Ngaarohwe (let's beat him),' bellowed a rumbling voice in the madding crowd.</p>
      <p>By sheer luck, the middle-aged banker and father-of-two, somehow managed to escape before he, or the car, could be harmed. This had been his second failed attempt in two days to leave the township in search of medical and food supplies for his family.</p>
      <p>But he was grounded.</p>
      <p>He belongs to a huge population of township residents across the country whose lives were turned upside-down between Monday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Well-coordinated units of violent criminals seized control of the streets, forcing everyone to stay at home under the guise of a national stay-away.</p>
      <p>Those who defied the orders were promptly beaten to set an example for those who had plans to go to work, school or attend to any of their day-to-day business.</p>
      <p>However, it was not staying in their homes which was the hardest part for the victims.</p>
      <p>It was the sight of starving children and the sick wreathing in pain helplessly which was unbearable for many.</p>
      <p>'These have been three of the most difficult days of my life since I was born,' Marimo later narrated his ordeal.</p>
      <p>'All the shops here were closed and I nearly lost my life while trying to get something to eat for my children.</p>
      <p>'My mother constantly needs dialysis and she had an appointment on Wednesday but we were stuck with her because all the roads were closed.'</p>
      <p>Marimo said he had no option but to risk his life as he attempted to get some supplies for his family and his ailing mother. Another resident, a mother-of-three, who declined to be identified said the situation left them distraught.</p>
      <p>'We had not anticipated that people would be forced to stay at home,' she said.</p>
      <p>'We thought the stay away and demonstration were supposed to be one's choice. We ended up buying just four tomatoes for just a dollar.</p>
      <p>'There was virtually no bread and mealie meal and those who were brave enough to sell anything did so at exorbitant prices.'</p>
      <p>Small business owners and vendors were not spared as their workstations, shops and stalls were either vandalised or looted.</p>
      <p>A survey conducted by The Sunday Mail revealed that public transport operators lost a significant amount of business while schools lost a chunk of learning time.</p>
      <p>Secretary for Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services, Mr Nick Mangwana, told a Press conference last week that school children could no longer be kept hostage as this could be detrimental to the country's future.</p>
      <p>'Given the fear that was instilled in school authorities and parents when violent thugs attacked schools, most schools remained closed,' he said.</p>
      <p>'However, parents are urged to let their children attend school tomorrow as Government has put in place the necessary safeguards to ensure that the safety of children and our valuable teachers is guaranteed. The future of our nation cannot be disturbed any further.'</p>
      <p>With intermittent internet connection, some could not purchase electricity tokens after they ran out of the commodity. It became a double tragedy as people failed to use firewood as alternative source of power because of the incessant rains.</p>
      <p>As the security details managed to cool off things on Wednesday, most shops opened on Thursday and long queues quickly emerged as most people had run out of food.</p>
      <p>The shopping spree that ensued showed that people had been held hostage by the three-day mayhem.</p>
      <p>Mr Mangwana also assured the nation that things had returned to normalcy.</p>
      <p>'As at today (Thursday), there is a peace, calm and normalcy across the country,' he said.</p>
      <p>'People were exercising their freedom of movement as there was increased vehicle and human traffic countrywide,' he said.</p>
      <p>'Citizens were conducting their daily business without hindrance as there is maximum security in and around the country.</p>
      <p>'The few people that remained holed up in their homes and the few business that remained shut out of fear if the marauding demonstrators are encouraged to join the majority of our people since their security is guaranteed.'</p>
      <p>Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, Cde Cain Mathema, warned the criminals that the wheels of justice will catch up with them.</p>
      <p>'We want to express appreciation to members of the public who have alerted the ZRP of criminals who have in their possession stolen property,' he said.</p>
      <p>'We urge you to continue reporting about these greedy and callous individuals to your nearest police stations.'</p>
      <p>Police statistics say about 700 hooligans have been charged with crimes ranging from arson, barricading roads, looting, violence and attempted murder in the wake of the demonstrations. Midlands has the highest number of people arrested at 196, Harare (181), Bulawayo (104), Mashonaland West (86), Manicaland (80), Mashonaland East (21) and Mashonaland Central (16).</p>

      <title>How Vilata Soaps and Detergents was born</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>What started off as a usual chit-chat by women on their way from church about how powerful the service was, how good-looking the choir members were in their uniforms that day and later how the cost of living was continuously going up later turned into a serious entrepreneurship discussion.</p>
      <p>It was especially the discussion on the rising cost of living and how inflation has eroded disposable incomes, which made a group of six women from the same church to come up with ways of empowering themselves and supplement their earnings.</p>
      <p>They were frustrated with the economic hardships. It was time to come up with ways of generating income that Vilata Soaps and Detergents came into being. From their little savings, the six women started, from scratch, a manufacturing company from their backyards. They were also inspired by a biblical story from 2 Kings 4:1-7 where a widow was in debt and dire need of financial assistance.</p>
      <p>Elisha asked the widow what she had in her house, which was only one jar of olive oil. And from that single jar, at Elisha's instructions, she managed to fill many more jars which she then sold to pay her debts and left with surplus to sustain herself and her two sons.</p>
      <p>'We didn't have much,' said co-founder and director of Vilata Mrs Molly Chuma.</p>
      <p>Like the widow in the bible who went to Elisha, the six women approached the Ministry of Women's Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development for guidance, where they were offered training in soaps and detergent making, advisory services, financial literacy, basic book-keeping, business management, marketing and packaging.</p>
      <p>'Instead of mourning about the situation, we sought help from the Ministry of Women Affairs and they assisted us with everything, for free. We started from scratch and now we are producing,' she said.</p>
      <p>Vilata was formed in February and started production in April in Tafara, using manual and rudimentary methods. The group make dishwashing liquid, toilet cleaner, multi-purpose cleaner, hand sanitizer, petroleum jelly, pine gel and detergent paste mainly for the domestic market, although the group also produce industrial soaps as per order.</p>
      <p>Two months after its formation, the group exhibited at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF) where they created market linkages and had an opportunity to learn from other upcoming entrepreneurs. They also exhibited at the Tourism and Trade Exhibition in May this year.</p>
      <p>'Soon after training, there was an opportunity to exhibit at ZITF through the Ministry and we quickly put together the little we had to start production. This was a stepping stone for us.</p>
      <p>Through this exhibition we met companies that wanted bulk supplies, Government officials and departments willing to assist as well as interaction with Zimbabwe Women Microfinance Bank's chief executive officer,' said Mrs Chuma.</p>
      <p>Vilata also had an opportunity to engage suppliers of inputs such as chemicals, branding and packaging materials. Today, Vilata is supplying local retail shops in Tafara as well as tuck shops with plans to grow into an industrial conglomerate. The company is still operating from Tafara, where dishwashing liquid has proven to be the cash cow and fast-moving product.</p>
      <p>Currently, over 300 litres of dishwashing soap, is produced every week, from the initial 40 litres.</p>
      <p>Mrs Chuma said prospects are bright for the detergent-making firm notwithstanding the obtaining economic challenges. She said this was an opportunity for Zimbabweans to create solutions to the challenges bedevilling the economy.</p>
      <p>Funds permitting, Vilata is looking at procuring machinery and move to a conducive industrial area where they should increase production volumes across its product range.'Right now we are doing everything manually, it is not easy but this is just the beginning, we will not remain small forever. If we get financial assistance, we would like to procure machinery and increase production so that we can expand our market. 'We want to do bulk supplies to industrial consumers too, but right now it is difficult to achieve manually. We use drums and sticks but we are hopeful Government, through the Ministry will continue to assist us,' said Mrs Chuma.</p>
      <p>Although Vilata is now on the shelves, it was not a walk in the park but passion, dedication and ambition overcame all the challenges which should inspire other women to follow for economic emancipation. Said Mrs Chuma:'We started from very little, but we are growing. Women need to make a bold move if they want to be empowered, the opportunities are there.</p>
      <p>'Everyone has a skill they can use, all you need is get the right advice and it's done.</p>
      <p>We had no idea we could make soaps or run a business, but here we are now. Women need education, get the right information, the Ministry has all that and we are grateful they assisted us.'</p>

      <title>Brics hegemony in Africa, its impact</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) 10th annual summit, which was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in July 2018 under the theme 'BRICS in Africa: Collaboration for inclusive growth and shared prosperity in the Fourth Industrial Revolution', signals BRICS hegemony in Africa.</p>
      <p>After decades of US and European Union (EU) domination of global political and economic architecture, the balance of power is shifting and being counterbalanced with the rise of China and other emerging economies such as Russia, India and Brazil, who make up BRICS.</p>
      <p>The acronym BRICS was originally coined in 2001 to refer to a group of four countries: Brazil, India, Russia and China.</p>
      <p>These four emerging economies started to meet regularly as a group in 2006.</p>
      <p>In 2010, South Africa was invited to join BRICS, bringing the total membership to five countries.</p>
      <p>The Delhi Declaration, passed at the 4th BRICS summit in March 2012, clearly sums up BRICS objectives as follows: 'We envision a future marked by global peace, economic and social progress and enlightened scientific temper.</p>
      <p>We stand ready to work with others, developed and developing countries together, on the basis of universally recognised norms of international law and multilateral decision-making, to deal with the challenges and opportunities before the world today.'</p>
      <p>According to World Trade Organisation (WTO) statistics, BRICS countries account for 30 percent of global land, 43 percent of global population, 21 percent of world GDP and 45 percent of world's agricultural production.</p>
      <p>As the grip and influence of the US and EU countries is waning in the globalised village, emerging economic blocs like BRICS have gained momentum and are spreading their tentacles in the so-called developing regions.</p>
      <p>Africa, given its diversity, strategic geographical position and abundant natural resources - in high demand globally - is flexing its muscles and can no longer be considered as a docile player on the global economic stage.</p>
      <p>Africa is now placing conditions on extraction of its natural resources and leveraging on them to advance its own political interests and economic development aspirations as envisioned in African Union (AU) Agenda 2063, and on robust economic integration initiatives such as the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA).</p>
      <p>Africa is rising and making informed and smart choices on who it wants to do business with, and under what conditions.</p>
      <p>African countries view BRICS as a development partner rather than as a threat to their independence and national sovereignty.</p>
      <p>BRICS offers African countries with an alternative - an equal partnership in economic co-operation and development and less reliance on the US and EU countries.</p>
      <p>Western countries are generally viewed by Africans as having double standards and often tend to use development finance, aid and technical assistance to serve their political and economic interests.</p>
      <p>Western development aid approach in Africa is now considered as outdated and based on perpetuating the colonial and imperialistic donor - recipient - subservient legacy.</p>
      <p>BRICS offers a new way of doing business, a partnership and a win-win deal with Africa.</p>
      <p>According to EU 2012 Parliamentary report, 'The role of BRICS in the Developing World', BRICS member states are catalysing changes in the architecture of international development co-operation, not only with regard to trade and financial flows, but also as donors.</p>
      <p>Over the last decade, BRICS increased financial and technical assistance and economic co-operation with developing countries through the south-south co-operation.</p>
      <p>Although BRICS development aid to Africa is lower in comparison to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries - often referred to as the major donor countries - it is nevertheless increasing.</p>
      <p>Lack of structured data often makes the tracking and quantification of BRICS development aid difficult to measure.</p>
      <p>The EU Parliamentary report cited above shows that FDI inflows from BRICS increased incredibly from less than $10 billion in 2002 to $146 billion eight years later in 2008.</p>
      <p>In 2016, FDI inflows from BRICS to recipient countries were estimated at $481 billion.</p>
      <p>BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) - launched in 2014 in Brazil at the BRICS 6th summit - seeks to mobilise resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other developing countries.</p>
      <p>NDB offers development aid alternatives to African countries, which relied mostly on western multilateral lending institutions like IMF and World Bank, which are controlled from western capitals.</p>
      <p>Western development aid has often come with strings attached and unfavourable conditions under the guise of promoting democracy, human rights and poverty alleviation.</p>
      <p>Over the last decade, BRICS countries, as a bloc and individually, have made significant contributions in strengthening economic co-operation and development ties with African countries.</p>
      <p>BRICS strength is in its policies of multilateralism, partnership, non-interference and recognition of national sovereignty of the countries they dialogue and co-operate with.</p>
      <p>BRICS has a different approach to development aid and views African countries as 'equal development partners'.</p>
      <p>BRICS aid projects in Africa are negotiated deals and determined by the needs of the recipient countries as opposed to being imposed.</p>
      <p>According to AfreximBank (Africa) and Exim Bank (India) 2018 report: 'Developing South-South Collaboration: An Analysis of Africa and India's Trade and Investment', trade between Africa and India is on the rise.</p>
      <p>Indo-Africa trade between 2001 and 2014 increased tenfold, making the Asian country Africa's fourth-largest national trading partner.</p>
      <p>According to the above report, Indo- Africa bilateral trade over the last 17 years rose as follows: 2001($7,2 billion), 2014 ($78 billion) and 2017 ($55 billion).</p>
      <p>Africa accounts for 8 percent of India's total trade. Indian deputy president Shri Venkaiah Naidu was in Zimbabwe in November 2018 on a three-nation tour of Botswana, Zimbabwe and Malawi aimed at deepening India's strategic economic co-operation with Africa.</p>
      <p>India and Zimbabwe signed six bilateral agreements in areas which include mining, information services, health and ICT.</p>
      <p>India also pledged a $310 million line of credit to Zimbabwe for infrastructure rehabilitation projects.</p>
      <p>Russia has also entered the fray in Africa.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov undertook a five-day tour of African countries, namely Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>This was viewed as marking the return of Russia in Africa as it did not focus much on defence deals, but on mining, agriculture, industrial development, energy and other commercial interests.</p>
      <p>China remains Africa's leading trading and development partner. China's relations with Africa are multifaceted and have been boosted by the Forum on China-Africa Co-operation (Focac) and other platforms such as the One Belt-One Road Initiative (OBOR) and institutions such as Export-Import Bank of China (Exim), China Development Bank and China-Africa Development Fund.</p>
      <p>China's policy on Africa has caused uneasiness in the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump has shown disdain and disrespect for African countries as shown by his previous disparaging remarks on Africa. The US New African Strategy policy announced by Trump's security adviser John Bolton on December 13 2018 at the Conservative Heritage Foundation clearly shows that US interest in Africa is in securing its security and economic interests and countering Chinese influence on the continent.</p>
      <p>On the sidelines of the G20 Summit held in Argentina in December 2018, BRICS Heads of State issued a joint statement criticising protectionism amid threats by the US to intensify tariffs on China and impose more sanctions on Russia.</p>
      <p>BRICS members urged open international trade, stressing that 'the spirit and rules of WTO run counter to unilateral and protectionist measures'.</p>
      <p>BRICS continues to increase its footprint in Africa and is forging strong symbiotic political and economic ties with African countries, thus heralding a new chapter in BRICS-Africa economic partnership and development co-operation.</p>

      <title>Zim to experience an upsurge of tourist arrivals</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>TOURIST arrivals from England to Zimbabwe are set to reach the 100 000 mark by year-end as interest in visiting the country continues to soar in the new dispensation, a tourism expert has said.</p>
      <p>In an interview with The Sunday Mail, Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) representative in London, Ms Felisicious Munjaidi, said tourist interest is on the surge judging by daily inquiries at the embassy and confirmed visits of mainly British nationals.</p>
      <p>'It is very exciting to note that before the advent of the new dispensation, we would go and reach out to people but for the first time since the coming into the fold of the new dispensation, people are coming to us expressing their interest to travel to Zimbabwe,' said Ms Munjaidi.</p>
      <p>She said the interest is coming from the general public, the Press and tour operators.</p>
      <p>Ms Munjaidi said the tour operators were the hardest hit by challenges in the previous dispensation.</p>
      <p>'With the new dispensation, we have now experienced an upsurge in tour operators marketing Zimbabwe as an ideal tourist destination. In 2017 our numbers were lower but in 2018, the number increased to 72 000. It's a huge number when you compare with the previous year.</p>
      <p>'However, when you compare with other countries like South Africa, Botswana and Zambia, you realise that we really need to work hard especially on social media- Facebook and Twitter so that by the end of 2019 we are confidant of reaching around 100 000 tourists' arrivals in Zimbabwe,' Ms Munjaidi said.</p>
      <p>She said given resources, there was need to coordinate tourism marketing on social media with the home office and also working with other line ministries.</p>
      <p>Ms Munjaidi commended the National Netball Team, which was in England for the Vitality Netball World Cup, saying their presence including the attendant roadshows helped in branding Zimbabwe as a country with hospitable and vibrant people.</p>
      <p>'It was really a celebratory time for Zimbabwe and we also managed to reach out to Zimbabweans living in England. There was palpable enthusiasm not just to visit home but also to invest in the tourism sector.'</p>
      <p>She said Zimbabweans living in England are assisting in marketing the country. She singled out Mr Patrick Kadewere - a Zimbabwean born businessman who is a councillor of North Ward in the Hunting Town Council.</p>
      <p>Despite limited resources, Ms Munjaidi said Zimbabwe's Ambassador to UK and Ireland, Rtd Colonel Christian Katsande, has managed to create different sectors where Zimbabweans with different expertise gather and exchange notes on development initiatives that can uplift the country.</p>
      <p>She said ZTA was working on a plan to partner with Rwandan Air to transport tour operators to Zimbabwe during the Sanganai/Hlanganani World Tourism Expo in September.</p>
      <p>'We are planning to bring tour operators - both new and old to meet our industry partners as well as travel around the country and experience our product so that when they come back they will be able to sell our country to their publics.'</p>
      <p>General tourist arrivals to Zimbabwe increased by 4 percent in the nine months to September 2018. There was a market shift of interest as international perception of the country became positive following the advent of the new dispensation.</p>
      <p>The international engagements by the ZTA in 2018 to countries such as Spain and the Asian continent, including the Middle East, resulted in Asia emerging as the top tourism source with a 25 percent increase to 79 858 from 63 744 followed by Oceania which increased 18 percent to 32 649. Visitors from Europe increased by 11 percent to end the period at 70 440.</p>

      <title>Methodist clergyman, wife buried</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE deputy administrative assistant to the Bishop of the United Methodist Church, Reverend Duncan Charwadza and his wife Janet Charwadza (nee Riziti), who both perished in a road accident on Wednesday night, were laid to rest at their rural home in Rowa, Mutare, yesterday.</p>
      <p>The accident, which occurred at the 140km peg along the Mutare-Harare highway, claimed the life of the reverend, his wife, Edwin Kudzaishe (26) and their driver Joice Mushamiri (26).</p>
      <p>The victims were travelling in an Isuzu KB 205, which veered off the road after side-swiping a haulage truck.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the driver of the Isuzu truck encroached into the opposite lane in a bid to overtake a haulage truck and side-swiped the haulage truck in the process.</p>
      <p>The Isuzu then overturned four times, resulting in the death of the four.</p>
      <p>Their bodies were later taken to Rusape General Hospital mortuary.</p>
      <p>Ass Comm Nyathi said the haulage truck driver escaped unscathed.</p>
      <p>Reverend Charwadza was 56 years old, while his wife Janet was 52 years old.</p>
      <p>He was ordained in 2001.</p>
      <p>When they met their fate, the Rev and his wife had just been picked up from the airport in Harare. They had landed from Dubai earlier that day.</p>
      <p>The couple had travelled to Dubai on November 29 with Bishop Nhiwatiwa and other church leaders for a Christmas retreat.</p>
      <p>In an interview on the sidelines of the burial, head of the Zimbabwe Episcopal area of the United Methodist Church, Bishop Eben Nhiwatiwa, said the reverend and his wife will be sadly missed.</p>
      <p>'They will both be sadly missed by the entire United Methodist Church family. We would like to convey our deepest condolences to the Charwadza and Riziti families,' he said.</p>
      <p>He described the late reverend as a superb leader who did his job diligently. Rev Charwadza, he said, was an invaluable asset in the United Methodist Church.</p>
      <p>'His role in the church was very central, he was serving in the connectional ministries, where he was the director. His post involved co-ordinating all ministries in the church and when Cyclone Idai hit our country, he became the cornerstone to organise, centralise and link up with relevant authorities for the donations towards the affected people,' said Bishop Nhiwatiwa.</p>
      <p>The bishop also said the reverend was always calm and never panicked during critical situations.</p>
      <p>In an interview, brother to the late Janet Charwadza, Artwell Maziti, described the late couple as loving people. The couple is survived by three children.</p>

      <title>DeMbare lose</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In a season that they made a mockery of the big institution that they are, Dynamos ended a forgetful season with a loss to Chicken Inn and finished outside the top four for the first time since 2006 in a thrilling encounter at Rufaro yesterday.DeMbare were full of drama, just like their season, ending the match with 10-men.</p>
      <p>Head coach Lloyd Mutasa was also sent off the technical bench by referee Norman Matemera after protesting over Godknows Murwira's yellow card.</p>
      <p>Through Murirwa, who was used as a striker, Dynamos took the lead in the first minute of the game, but Chicken Inn restored parity in the 23rd minute through a sublime Darryl Nyandoro's free-kick from 25 yards.</p>
      <p>Rahman Gumbo's men however collected maximum points courtesy of an additional time strike by second half substitute Obadiah Tarumbwa who bagged a brace that secured Chicken Inn fourth position.</p>
      <p>DeMbare would have ended the season number four if they had avoided defeat. Dynamos appeared to have salvaged a draw after King Nasama, who replaced Valentine Ndaba in the second half, headed in a Godknows Murirwa free-kick from the left flank.</p>
      <p>Nasama's strike had restored parity at 2-2 in a swinging tie that saw Chicken Inn put in front by Tarumbwa's fourth touch after introduction. The visitors had been lucky to go into the breather at level after Takunda Sadiki and Valentine Ndaba's efforts hit the cross bar.</p>
      <p>Dynamos assistant coach Murape Murape admitted it was a disappointing season and said it was made worse by the loss which he attributed to poor officiating.</p>
      <p>'There is nothing that we can say. Everyone saw what happened.</p>
      <p>'We are not happy with the officiating, we played well but these things happen in football so we just have to look forward to next season.</p>
      <p>'It is disappointing, but also we have to look at the positives, we came from number 15 and to be on position five is much better.</p>
      <p>'So the next important thing is to look forward and prepare for next year and come back very strongly,' Murape said.For Gumbo, it was a positive finish which he hopes can inspire the next season.'We wanted to finish in the top four because we have been building a team and we want continuity for next season,' Gumbo said.</p>
      <p>'I am bringing in youngsters and we will continue from where we left this season, sometimes you have to be very serious about your ambitions.</p>
      <p>'We were fighting Dynamos for the fourth position and we got what we wanted, tough luck to Dynamos,' he said.</p>
      <p>Teams</p>
      <p>Dynamos A Reynese, P Makaha(Macheke 93rd Makaha), S Gorogodyo, M Machazane, D Mukandi, T Chipunza, B Amidu, V Ndaba (Nasama 57th), T Sadiki, M Mambare, G Murwira</p>
      <p>Chicken Inn P Zendera, P Bernard, G Majika (Samakweri 86th), T Hadebe, P Tafirenyika, M Jackson, T Kutinyu(O Tarumbwa 61st), D Nyandoro (L Lawe 50th), C Matawu, B Juru, L Mhlanga</p>

      <title>'Liberation fighters united Zanu and Zapu'</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>We continue chronicling the political life of Cde Jane Lungile Ngwena. This week Cde Ngwenya narrates to our Deputy News Editor Levi Mukarati events at the Lancaster House Conference and the welcome the liberation fighters received in Rhodesia after the London agreement.</p>
      <p>Question: You were one of the last persons to see Ethan Dube, we also understand you were in the same office with Zapu Vice President Jason Ziyapapa Moyo the day he was bombed, can you narrate this incident?</p>
      <p>Answer: The death of Jason Moyo, was seen and in some circles is seen as having been orchestrated from within us.</p>
      <p>But like I said, our telephone conversations were hacked by the Rhodesians and that is where they devised a strategy to bomb and kill JZ.</p>
      <p>I must be clear that there was a lot of suspicions that were going on amongst us.</p>
      <p>I also cannot dispute that there were also a lot of plots going on amongst us.</p>
      <p>We were waging a war, but in that war there were those who had power ambitions.</p>
      <p>If people didn't want power, then there was no way the likes of Mugabe, Zvobgo, Sithole and Tekere would view Joshua Nkomo as weak and plot to form Zanu.</p>
      <p>Plots were there and even today they remain entrenched in Zanu PF.</p>
      <p>Question: You speak of these plots with eloquence, can you share some of these clandestine activities that happened during the war?</p>
      <p>Answer: Clandestine? You are right, we suspected each other of covert or underground operations?</p>
      <p>You see, two years before JZ died, Herbert Chitepo was assassinated through a car bomb explosion.</p>
      <p>His bodyguard Silas Shamiso also died in the incident. When Herbert died, I was in Morogoro Tanzania where our fighters were being trained.</p>
      <p>I was with fighters like Ambrose Mutinhiri, from Zipra, who gave us a briefs on how they were progressing and we were satisfied with what they were doing.</p>
      <p>So while I was there, JZ joined us with a message that Herbert Chitepo had been bombed and Zanu was suspecting us in Zapu, to be behind the act.</p>
      <p>He also said the whole thing had attracted a lot of suspicions and there were some people in Zanu like Tekere and Mugabe who thought it was Josiah Tongogara who had eliminated Chitepo.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the freedom fighters in Zanu were thinking it was Mugabe who was behind the act.</p>
      <p>The death of the nationalist was seen as another elimination by power hungry individuals.</p>
      <p>Even when Samuel Tichafa Parirenyatwa died in 1962, Zapu members believed it was Nkomo who masterminded the act.</p>
      <p>People said Nkomo feared Parirenyatwa, was angling to take leadership of the party.</p>
      <p>Again Nkomo was to be suspected of killing his deputy Jason Moyo.</p>
      <p>These suspicions or suspected clandestine activities were there during the liberation struggle.</p>
      <p>But I should point out that the death of Chitepo got us in Zapu worried because even up to today, many believe it was an inside Zanu job.</p>
      <p>That is why we spoke strongly against turning on each other in the face of the enemy. Zapu stood up and said we shouldn't kill each other because like I said, we were strongly convinced, then, that Chitepo was assassinated by those in Zanu.</p>
      <p>It is true that Zanu had problems, but we did not get involved in their issues and they also never came into our problems.</p>
      <p>We got to a point where we hated each other, but we never fought against each other. The hatred between Zanu and Zapu was clear for anyone to see.</p>
      <p>That is why we had a situation where we did not want Zanu soldiers coming to the Southern areas of Zimbabwe, that is, the other side of Midlands into Matabeleland.</p>
      <p>I can say this without fear and even the Zanu guys know it was a no go area during the war.</p>
      <p>We also wouldn't 'stray' into the Mashonaland regions.</p>
      <p>This hatred was there and that is why Mugabe, after independence, spoke of unity. That is why today even Mnangagwa speaks of unity.</p>
      <p>We know we should unite our people because certain differences are rooted in the past.</p>
      <p>We are a people and we should get to a point where we bury our past differences for progress sake.</p>
      <p>One interesting aspect about the liberation struggle was that at leadership levels, that is us the nationalists, is where the seeds of hatred were sowed.</p>
      <p>We wanted too much power. There was a lot of selfishness and people made evil plots to get top posts.</p>
      <p>It is us who created these 'silent no go areas for Zanla or Zipra forces'.</p>
      <p>But the fighters had one purpose, to take back the country and shared the same vision. That is why even when we had meetings with Tongogara, he spoke in support of the unity Zanla fighters were calling for whilst in camps.</p>
      <p>The soldiers focused on turning the heat on Ian Smith. Indeed Smith felt the heat and realised negotiating with us was the only way out.</p>
      <p>That is why we had the Lancaster House Conference and eventually independence.</p>
      <p>Question: Before we get to independence, can you walk us through the deliberations at Lancaster House Conference since you were among the people there?</p>
      <p>Answer: When we went to Lancaster, we were united. We had been united by the fighters.</p>
      <p>Lancaster House Conference had its ups and downs as people threatened to walk away after failing to agree on certain issues.</p>
      <p>That is why these talks ran for months. The talks were conducted between September 10 and December 15, 1979.</p>
      <p>The actual signing of the agreement was on 21 December 1979.</p>
      <p>I went there as a member of Zapu, but I did not attend the big meetings.</p>
      <p>The delegates were over 65 and were made up of the Patriotic Front which brought together Zapu and Zanu leaders, then there was the Zimbabwe Rhodesia delegation made up of those people that had made an internal settlement in which Abel Muzorewa was prime minister.</p>
      <p>Lastly was the British delegation led by Peter Carington. He was the conference chairperson.</p>
      <p>We had intelligent people in those meeting. We had lawyers, advisors and advocates. So there were plenary sessions of the conference and we had over 45 of these.</p>
      <p>These plenaries were tasked to come up recommendations on the key issues that were under discussion such as a Constitution, cease fire and arrangements or modalities for a post-independence period</p>
      <p>The three delegations each had more than 20 people.</p>
      <p>The Patriotic front apart from the two leaders included people like Dzingai Mutumbuka, Simbi Mubako, George Silundika, Ariston Chambati, John Nkomo and Ernest Kadungure.</p>
      <p>Among those that had agreed to work with Ian Smith under the unrecognised Zimbabwe Rhodesia was the leader Muzorewa, Ndabaningi Sithole, Chief Kayisa Ndiweni, Gordon Chavhunduka, Simpson Mutambanengwe and David Zamchiya</p>
      <p>After the conference, as Zapu members we had a meeting where we agreed that we would return to Zimbabwe as one team, comprising Zanu and Zapu members.</p>
      <p>But on the eve of coming back, we heard that Mugabe and some other Zanu members were not coming with us.</p>
      <p>Mugabe stayed behind in London and I don't know why they did that.</p>
      <p>We had sent our members to our fighters to announce the cease fire and that they would be given further instructions on what to do.</p>
      <p>But we were also careful about planning for our return because we suspected Smith might renege on what we agreed. When we got to the airport in Salisbury, the immigration officials refused to stamp my passport. Remember I had left the country with Smith's hit-men on my trail.</p>
      <p>My colleagues refused to leave the airport without me. As a result we spent about four hours at the airport as officials there consulted on what to do with me.</p>
      <p>Our people knew we were coming back and they had assembled at the airport to welcome us.</p>
      <p>With the delays, the people outside became impatient and began singing demanding to see us. Eventually the officials allowed us to pass.</p>
      <p>Question: At the airport you say people were waiting to receive you back home, can you explain more about that reception at the airport?</p>
      <p>Answer: What pleased us was that our people did not turn violent. They remained disciplined. When we got out, we were welcomed by a big crowd.</p>
      <p>You could mistake them for a colony of ants.</p>
      <p>They sang happily as they received us. People danced and some of the black police officers who were there ended up joining the dance party.</p>
      <p>The airport was packed to the brim and I had always known there were a lot of people in Zimbabwe, but I had not imagined they would be that many on the day.</p>
      <p>We spent about two hours at the airport as we greeted our people and tried to maneouver our way.</p>
      <p>There were also a lot of journalists and camera people standing on vehicle rooftops to get good pictures of us.</p>
      <p>We were received warmly and I had never imagined I would get such a welcome in my home country. We left Harare for Bulawayo and again it was the same welcome.</p>
      <p>In Bulawayo we were received by bumper crowds. People walked on foot with us from the airport to the CBD.</p>
      <p>When we got into town, I remember we went to the rooftop of one tall building and saw a river if not an ocean of people happy in the streets.</p>
      <p>It was like Bulawayo did not have any cars as people filled up the CBD.</p>

      <title>Jatropha biodiesel project back on track</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Conceived 12 years ago when the country was in the throes of biting fuel shortages, the jatropha biodiesel project - which was premised on cutting the country's fuel import bill - seemingly suffered a stillbirth.</p>
      <p>The multi-million dollar jatropha processing plant in Mt Hampden, which was touted as the first of its kind in Africa, became a white elephant. Government's envisaged plans to transform farmlands into 'oil fields' also fell through.</p>
      <p>But the project is now on the rebound.</p>
      <p>Government, which is aggressively working on cutting the import bill, narrow the trade deficit and actively promote renewable energy, has decided to breathe life into the project. The Ministry of Energy and Power Development, through Finealt Engineering - its biodiesel processing company - has adopted the business.</p>
      <p>Most notably, the decision to pursue the project was taken after years of research, developing a profitable business model and fundraising. At the 6000-hectare Nyakadecha Plantation in Mudzi, Mashonaland East, a massive jatropha project is taking shape. Land preparations at the plantation are nearing completion.</p>
      <p>Nyakadecha Plantation's research and development manager Mr Tadious Nyamayevu told The Sunday Mail during a tour of the estate last week that Government never contemplated discontinuing the jatropha biodiesel project.</p>
      <p>'Government never stopped the National Biodiesel Programme since its inception in 2006. It only scaled it down and focused on research and development after having realised that there was need to create expertise in the growing of the jatropha feedstock and biodiesel processing,' said Mr Nyamayevu.</p>
      <p>'We had to go back to the drawing board since most of the information we had back then was from the Internet. Through years of research, we found that the best varieties that yielded the greatest results emerged from Mudzi, Mutoko and Victoria Falls.</p>
      <p>'We have since located Mudzi, Mutoko, Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe and some places in Mashonaland East as some of the places that have some of the ideal climate conditions for growing jatropha. We have also identified that cuttings have yielded better results, compared to seedlings.</p>
      <p>'Thus, we also saw it fit to manufacture biodiesel machines that are suitable for the Zimbabwean climate, so that we do not have to import the machines or the spare parts from other countries. During the inception of the programme, we acquired machines from China. However, these are lying idle as we do not have foreign currency to buy the machine parts needed.</p>
      <p>'So, to us, lack of funds has been a blessing in disguise because we were able to work on a number of researches that will benefit the project.'</p>
      <p>It is believed that over the years, Finealt Engineering has been engaging technical experts drawn from local universities who have been testing different varieties of jatropha plants with a view of establishing those suitable for the country's various ecological regions. Given enough resources and investments, Mr Nyamayevu said, the project has the potential of creating thousands of jobs and save foreign currency.</p>
      <p>'For every five hectares of jatropha, one job is created. Of the 6000 hectares availed, 1 200 jobs are created. Biodiesel can also save the country millions of foreign currency.'</p>
      <p>The country currently uses $100 million per month to import fuel. Bioenergy experts say a tonne of seed oil can produce 300 litres of biodiesel.</p>
      <p>Finealt Engineering envisages that once production begins, the National Oil Company (NOIC) will be the offtaker.</p>
      <p>Presently, Finealt Engineering is producing a litre of biodiesel at US$0,98 but intends to drive the price down to US$0,78 due to improved efficiencies. The retail price for regular diesel is $1,23 to $1,29 per litre.</p>
      <p>Mr Nyamayevu said, 'Although the production of biodiesel locally does not guarantee lowering of diesel prices, international fuel prices fluctuate depending on supply and demand. We are looking at the broader picture.</p>
      <p>'These include security of fuel supply and reduced dependence on imports thereby saving foreign currency. lt will also lead to the creation of employment, rural development and reduction of carbon emissions through increased uptake of biofuels, which are clean sources of energy.</p>
      <p>'Thus, the programme is not aimed at reducing prices of diesel only, but has much wider benefits to the country, local communities and will also contribute to climate change mitigation.'</p>
      <p>According to Mr Nyamayevu, who is also an engineering expert, the country needs to exploit the limitless opportunities in the renewable energy sector in order to grow the economy and slash imports.</p>
      <p>'We have an abundance of resources in the country, they have not been fully utilised. There are areas that are not suitable for agriculture and can be used for solar farming,' he said.</p>
      <p>'There is need for Government to look into this area and adequately invest in this sector. It is not something that can be done overnight, but it can be done, and it can save the country so much revenue and provide the much-needed electricity.'</p>

      <title>Industry can't rest on its laurels</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Howdy folks! Some may remember my argument that the targets of the Draft Industrialisation Development Policy (2017-2021) are not dynamic and that we should have ambitious manufacturing sector targets.</p>
      <p>The recently announced results of the annual Manufacturing Sector Survey by the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries attest to that. Within a space of one year, capacity utilisation has risen by 13,1 percent from 34,3 percent in 2015 to 47,4 in 2016.</p>
      <p>This when the Draft IDP has set an industrial capacity utilisation target of just 50 percent by 2021. In the survey, manufacturers actually expect capacity utilisation to rise to 50,3 percent by next year.</p>
      <p>The Industry and Commerce Ministry is, therefore, encouraged to revisit its capacity utilisation aims; 75 percent is a good target by 2021.</p>
      <p>You see, the target you set for yourself will determine the strength of strategies to be implemented. And 50 percent can be easily attained without even thinking outside the box.</p>
      <p>But what both policymakers and industrialists need to know right now is that they still have a lot of ground to cover in their quest to position the manufacturing sector as an engine for growth.</p>
      <p>We are faced with a tricky situation whereby the rise in capacity utilisation, for the first time in five years, has brought over-excitement that the manufacturing policies of Government are working and companies are becoming competitive.</p>
      <p>If we are to critically interrogate what happened, we will see that most players in the manufacturing sector are as unrepentant as before and it is still business as usual.</p>
      <p>It is expected that when you block a river, like we used to do with some naughty cowboys in the country, you create a dam and water stops flowing downstream.</p>
      <p>But soon enough the pressure destroys the rudimentary dam and the river starts flowing again. We can draw many parallels from that when looking at the sharp jump in capacity utilisation.</p>
      <p>Import controls under Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016 have been largely responsible for the growth. Unrestrained importation has been virtually banned and shifted demand to local products.</p>
      <p>Folks are not buying local products because they are lowly-priced and of good quality. They are buying because their choices have been narrowed.</p>
      <p>This is where we need to be careful and probe the sustainability of current capacity growth. Is it any different from cowboys blocking the river with sand?</p>
      <p>What will happen if the controls are removed today? Will demand patterns remain unchanged or folks will rekindle their love for imports? As long as folks derive more merits from imports and continue to nurse a nostalgia for them, any increase in capacity during the period of protection will be futile.</p>
      <p>Industry must not utilise this incubation period to focus on making super profits from their over-priced goods. They should use the opportunity to change consumer preferences in favour of their products by meeting and surpassing expectations.</p>
      <p>What will matter most at the sunset of incubation are price and quality. And the winner will take it all! Manufacturers should, therefore, not sit on their laurels and think that the demand that has been dished to them on a giant silver platter will last forever.</p>
      <p>They have to earn it. They have to win the hearts of consumers. It's sad that some firms that have been protected are still not showing any signs of fostering sustainable consumer retention.</p>
      <p>In fact, they are becoming arrogant. They know consumers have no option but to buy from them. It is that arrogance that stops them from refining their cost structures and business models. They get a sobering reality when they try to export their products.</p>
      <p>This is why 79 percent of manufacturers indicated that they do not export their products. And the biggest reasons they cite for not exporting are high costs and lack of competitiveness.</p>
      <p>I will highlight a few issues from the CZI survey. The pricing mechanism for most manufacturers, for starters, is still mark-up over cost. The survey said 43 percent of respondents use mark-up.</p>
      <p>This pricing method is inappropriate for a sector targeting to enhance competitiveness to meet international standards. This type of pricing often fails to adequately cater for competition and does not take into account the buyer's needs and ability to pay.</p>
      <p>It, therefore, often results in companies over-estimating the price of products as the method includes sunk costs while ignoring opportunity cost.</p>
      <p>The mark-up method also doesn't take into account future demand for a product. It is also saddening to note that only 48 percent of manufacturers have an implementation plan with organisational targets, size and change management processes.</p>
      <p>Isn't it alarming that 52 percent don't? Operating without an implementation plan is like flying on auto pilot. Have our industrialists forgotten that failure to plan is planning to fail? Having no plan at all means that they have no direction and they don't even know where they are going.</p>
      <p>The survey also said that only 18 percent of manufacturers extensively collaborate with local tertiary institutions on research and development. We are in an era in which innovation and creativity are the driving forces behind all thriving businesses.</p>
      <p>For firms to successfully innovate, they can't entirely rely on their internal RandD departments. But most manufacturing companies do not even have RandD departments.</p>
      <p>We should see more productive linkages between industry and institutions of tertiary and higher learning for access to a huge pool of talent and skills.</p>
      <p>Multinationals like IBM owe their success to their partnerships with universities. When you look at the strategies proposed by industrialists for price reduction, you also see an element of insincerity as close to 70 percent of the strategies are what they want Government to do for them.</p>
      <p>What are they also doing to reduce prices? For industrialists who are preaching Lean production methods and internal devaluation, we surely expect to hear more on the micro-economics they are playing to pull costs down.</p>
      <p>Local industry is also not serious when it comes to employee training and development. The survey established that only nine percent of manufacturing firms extensively invested in employee training and development. Yet, the survey also tells us that 18 percent of firms carried out new investments in capital.</p>
      <p>How do you reconcile that folks? It means companies acquired new machinery and equipment but did not train employees how to operate them. Untrained employees often under-perform, make mistakes and waste resources, making them unproductive and inefficient.</p>
      <p>Safety is also still proving to be an issue of particular concern in the manufacturing sector. About 35 percent of firms said they didn't have safety and health plans, while 55 percent don't have medical insurance for employees.</p>
      <p>This explains why we have such a high Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate in Zimbabwe. Surely, not having a safety and health plan means workers don't even know about the safety procedures to follow and just go by instinct.</p>
      <p>It means some workplaces are death traps with accidents waiting to happen. Employers should know that safety improves quality, increases credibility and creates a strong employee base.</p>
      <p>While the a manufacturers continue to concentrate their exports to South Africa, Mozambique and Zambia, they should also seriously consider diversifying to other markets with currencies that are appreciating.</p>
      <p>The rand, for instance, has continued to fall this year, which reduces export returns. The meticais of Mozambique also fell heavily this year. The Malawian kwacha has also suffered the same fate, with only the Zambian kwacha gaining relatively.</p>
      <p>All this is happening as Zimbabwe is supposed to launch a new National Trade Policy next year. It is hoped that industrialists will lobby for a policy that provides for more export incentives, identify new markets and capacitate producers with more information to empower them to export.</p>
      <p>Our industrialists must seriously address areas in which they have been tried and found wanting by the 2016 Manufacturing Sector Survey.</p>
      <p>Later folks!</p>

      <title>Fresh evidence exposes MDC's anarchy plot</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Alliance legislator Honourable Godfrey Sithole allegedly called for the unconstitutional overthrow of President Emmerson Mnangagwa and incited his supporters to loot goods during the so-called shut down that led to loss of lives, fresh evidence has revealed.</p>
      <p>The damning evidence confirms Government's position that the January 14 riots were not a protest against a hike in fuel prices but a larger plot to incite anarchy and dislodge the elected Head of State.</p>
      <p>Local private media and Western media outposts have run with the false narrative that the orgy of violence was a result of a hike in fuel prices, ignoring masses of evidence which show a chain of events of how the MDC orchestrated and executed the plot to dethrone the sitting Government in cahoots with Non-Governmental Organisations.</p>
      <p>A video footage in possession of The Sunday Mail shows that on the first day of the riots, a fortnight ago, Mr Sithole used his Ford Ranger vehicle, registration number ADI 8921 to drive around in his Chitungwiza North constituency mobilising MDC supporters to engage in lawlessness.</p>
      <p>In the video which The Sunday Mail got last week, Mr Sithole let the cat out of the bag as he revealed that part of the plan was to disrupt President Mnangagwa's trip to Eurasia, cause him to return home and mobilise people to block him from getting to State House.</p>
      <p>In a street address attended by a group of perceived MDC Alliance supporters, chants of their president, Advocate Nelson Chamisa are clearly audible and pronounced.</p>
      <p>'Comrades we have not come here to play. This will not end until he (Mnangagwa) is out of office.</p>
      <p>'Toda kunomugachira Mnangagwa paairport. Ari kudzoka nenyaya yecrisis iyoyi. Mnangagwa toda kunomugarira paairport. Haachasvika kuState House (We are going to interrupt President Mnangagwa's arrival at the airport. We will make sure that he comes back to the country because of this crisis. We will make sure we block him from ever setting foot at State House again.'</p>
      <p>Mr Sithole further urged the hooligans to loot nearby shops and to help themselves to any food items they so wished.</p>
      <p>'Chinonzi kudira jecha munochiziva here? Iko zvino tavakuzodira jecha. Hapana munhu achadzokera, tavakugara mustreet ikozvino.</p>
      <p>'Tichaswera pano. Mukaita nzara kana pane ane shop yakavhura munopfuura muchitora tozobhadhara' (We are now going all-out to cause disturbances. No one is going to go home, we are going to be operating here in the streets.</p>
      <p>''If anyone is hungry, feel free to loot from any shop and we will pay for the consequences later.'</p>
      <p>An MDC youth league member Chamunorwa Madya, who is alleged to be at some hideout in Waterfalls, Harare also addressed the gathering inciting the crowd to make the country ungovernable.</p>
      <p>'No one is going to go home. No one who is in Chitungwiza is going to go to the city (Harare) because we must blockade all roads. Those who are in town will not come here. We have taken over the streets. We are going to descend on the airport and make sure that (President) Mnangagwa does not go to State House,' he said while chanting MDC-Alliance slogans and threatening unspecified action against Zanu PF supporters.</p>
      <p>It has been gathered that soon after the address by the Member of Parliament, the protesters who had all along been peaceful became violent and pulled down the robot that was at the intersection.</p>
      <p>Anarchy then reigned supreme as the robot was stoned and set on fire.</p>
      <p>The lawlessness took a turn for the worse after two large crowds, one from Zengeza side and another from Unit L shops combined with the one at Unit C, before marching towards Makoni police station.</p>
      <p>The combined group, The Sunday Mail is reliably informed, stormed the police station burning vehicles in the car park before partially setting alight the building. Several police officers were assaulted by the marauding hooligans while other officers ran for cover and managed to escape.</p>
      <p>Police later confirmed that the violence in Chitungwiza left one person dead and several others injured.</p>
      <p>Speaking to our sister paper The Herald last week, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Mr Nick Mangwana said the President had been briefed on how the demonstrations had been pre-planned by the MDC-Alliance and its allies.</p>
      <p>'Following today's extensive briefing to his Excellency the President, Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, on the state of affairs in the country, it has become clearer more than ever before that the violent demonstrations which rocked the country last week were long pre-planned by MDC Alliance working in cahoots with its associate organisations, principally the ZCTU and political NGOs led by the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition and with foreign organisations and individuals who had infiltrated into the country for the purpose.</p>
      <p>'The violent demonstrations were a direct result of this elaborate plan agreed to at a meeting held last year at Wild Geese Resort, which plan was meant to trigger and precipitate instability in the country for regime change,' he said.</p>

      <title>A festival of cheap shots - Zifa elections long on drama - Sugar, Barry, Chamu the silver lining</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE build up to Zifa's December 1 board elections has degenerated into a mudslinging affair, a festival of cheap and below the belt shots.</p>
      <p>An affair long on drama and terribly short on substance is seeing accusations of all sorts flying from one end to the other.</p>
      <p>Phillip Chiyangwa and Omega Sibanda are accused of using mafia tactics to wade off competition.</p>
      <p>Aspiring Zifa presidential candidate Felton Kamambo is accused of making inappropriate overtures towards a Mighty Warriors player and failing an 'integrity test.'</p>
      <p>Gift Banda, who intends to contest for the Zifa presidency but had his nomination papers thrown out, is accused of manufacturing a fake letter that ostensibly lifts his suspension from football.</p>
      <p>The electoral committee says Banda cannot contest the elections because he is going through 'rehabilitation.'</p>
      <p>But can it be drama when no one claims to be receiving death threats?</p>
      <p>Enter Zifa general secretary Joseph Mamutse.</p>
      <p>Mamutse is said to be receiving death threats from people who are not too chuffed by the fact that some aspiring candidates have been barred from contesting the elections.</p>
      <p>The police are handling that case.</p>
      <p>Those who expected a potpourri created by aspiring candidates selling their manifestos ahead of the elections have every reason to be disappointed.</p>
      <p>It will sure get worse as election day approaches.</p>
      <p>But those seeking some amusement have their popcorn in hand, feet on the table and eyes on the drama that will climax with the elections.</p>
      <p>As it stands, Chiyangwa and Sibanda stand unopposed and the pair believes they have already done a 'pfee', a smooth and grand entrance into the two highest offices in local football.</p>
      <p>While PC and Omz, as the Zifa president and his deputy like to call themselves, are already toasting to victory and shooting some hilarious videos, their rivals insist it's not over yet, not by a long shot.</p>
      <p>Kamambo and Banda have since written to the Ministry of Youth, Arts, Sports and Recreation, registering their displeasure.</p>
      <p>Thankfully the woman in charge of that Ministry, Honourable Kirsty Coventry, appreciates the repercussions of Government interfering with football matters.</p>
      <p>Another Kamambo missive went to Zurich where Fifa acknowledged receipt but are yet to reply to it.</p>
      <p>But it's not all gloomy!</p>
      <p>The silver lining is that away from the top, there are signs of a new generation of football administrators coming through the ranks.</p>
      <p>The arrival of young turks such as Sugar Chagonda, Barry Manandi and Chamu Chiwanza onto the scene ensures that the Zifa board will not be a gathering of old and tired minds.</p>
      <p>Chagonda comes with the backing of the Eastern Region and believes his experience in the corporate world is what Zifa needs.</p>
      <p>'My experience and expertise in the field of communication, diplomacy and brand management can add value to Zifa and turn it into the brand that everyone wants to be associated with.</p>
      <p>'We must be able to create an attractive entity where the corporate world must be bidding to sponsor,' said Chagonda.</p>
      <p>Manandi, the 41-year-old co-owner of Northern Region Division One side Al Buraak, decided to run for office on the very night the Warriors played the DRC in an Afcon qualifier at the National Sports Stadium last month.</p>
      <p>'That game we played against DRC and the trouble I encountered getting into the stadium gave me the push,' revealed Manandi.</p>
      <p>'It's an idea we had been mooting for a season but on that night I realized that we couldn't carry on just sitting on the sidelines, we had to step in and try to support and assist the game. So in short, it's about service to the game.'</p>
      <p>Chiwanza is Chiyangwa's longtime ally but the former Affirmative Action Group president is quick to highlight that he has been involved with the game long before PC became the Zifa boss.</p>
      <p>'I worked on various committees such as Mzansi 90 with Cuthbert Dube at the helm. I have been involved in football for decades and even ran the Ziva Kwawakabva Football tournament in Mabvuku where I grew up.</p>
      <p>'I am availing myself to serve in the Zifa board because there are football people who have asked me to answer to this national duty call,' said Chiwanza.</p>

      <title>ZDF's iron hand in velvet gloves</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Last week, Zimbabwe honoured men and women who dedicated their lives to defending the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, including ensuring world peace through various onerous international assignments.</p>
      <p>This year, the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) marked 40 years - a Ruby Jubilee - of safeguarding and protecting the country's hard-won independence.</p>
      <p>As it has been evolving, one of its milestones over the past four decades has been the progressive and deliberate elevation of women to previously male-dominated roles.</p>
      <p>This has naturally created opportunities for capable women such as 28-year-old Flight Lieutenant (Flt Lt) Tildah Angoni and Master Sergeant (MSgt) Tendai Nashe (32) from the Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ).</p>
      <p>MSgt Nashe</p>
      <p>Essentially, these women represent the defence force's iron hand in a velvet glove.</p>
      <p>For them, it is not about breaking the glass ceiling, but about inspiring both men and women.</p>
      <p>A distinguished combat helicoapter pilot, Flt Lt Angoni was inspired to take to the skies after attending an airshow hosted by theAFZ at Charles Prince Airport some years ago.</p>
      <p>MSgt Nashe, who is a paratrooper instructor, says she was drawn to skydiving when she was exposed to the adrenaline-pumping activity in a military camp where she grew up.</p>
      <p>With such experiences, both ladies were determined to write their own success stories.</p>
      <p>With a total of 305 flying hours, Flt Lt Angoni has flown aircraft which includes an SF260 during her first pilot training course and an Aloutte 3 helicopter. She did a Primary Trainer 6, which is a pilot training level, at the Airforce Aviation University in China.</p>
      <p>'A combat pilot is a war person. The aircraft I fly has war configurations. Besides, we don't just do basic flying training, but we</p>
      <p>also do the combat part,' she said in an interview.</p>
      <p>'That marks the difference between civilian and combat helicopter flying in the sense that our training is in conjunction with war tactics, while the civilian training may be as a hobby or for transportation.'</p>
      <p>To her credit, MSgt Nashe has had 420 jumps since 2008.</p>
      <p>These include five into water bodies and three performed at night.</p>
      <p>The jumps need special skill as one can land far from the shore and face difficulties swimming to safety.</p>
      <p>At night, a paratrooper risks missing the landing target and, in most cases, this might result in serious injury or death.</p>
      <p>From basic military training, MSgt Nashe graduated to being an 'aircrafts' woman before joining the Parachute Training School.</p>
      <p>She trains airborne forces within the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and AFZ parachute jumping instructors.</p>
      <p>'We carry out combat training of Zimbabwe National Army to the maximum standards,' she said.</p>
      <p>'We carry out additional tasks like 'entertainment' jumps during national events like Zimbabwe International Trade Fair or soccer matches. We also provide parachute search and rescue missions.'</p>
      <p>MSgt Nashe's day begins at 3am and at times ends at midnight.</p>
      <p>She has managed to advance her career in China, attending training courses in 2016 and 2019.</p>
      <p>'At times you have to finish work around 10pm because we do jumps at night or we carry out night paratroops with the students,' she said.</p>
      <p>'Naturally, women do not have the physique as that of men, so the task is stressing. I am a mother and this means there is not much time to be with my two boys - Tavonga and Alex.</p>
      <p>'At times when I finish work I am not able to talk to them because I will be exhausted. I feel like I have lost them because it seems my children really want to be with their father.'</p>
      <p>However, MSgt Nashe says she feels lucky for having an understanding husband, who is also a Master Sergeant in the military.</p>
      <p>For Flt Lt Angoni, her career demands that she must continuously perfect her flying skills.</p>
      <p>'When you have a determination of being a pilot, you can do it, whether male or female. The field is male-dominated, but in the military, we are taught team work.</p>
      <p>'I need to fly more to discover techniques and become experienced.</p>
      <p>'My job means a lot to me in the sense that being a combat pilot means commitment to serve the nation.</p>
      <p>'When there are emergencies like floods or civil unrests, we are involved and I know I have to do something to help people.'</p>

      <title>Behold Jah Signal explodes!</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>DESPITE recent negative headlines, it appears the heavens keep smiling on dancehall singer, Jah Signal.</p>
      <p>The musician's stock is rising with each passing day, just like his famous leaps on stage, which can easily arouse a kangaroo's envy.</p>
      <p>Armed with a hit album, 'Jaya', and sing-along songs like 'Sweetie' (Shinga Muroora), 'Yekedero', 'Stonyeni' and 'Ndakakumaka' -Jah Signal is creating seductive waves that have captured the attention of not only locals but across continents.</p>
      <p>Career wise, he is yet to set his foot wrong. This probably explains why Jamaicans are interested in signing the musician. The 'Jaya' singer's case is unlike that of some local musicians that have gone to extremes, splashing thousands of United States dollars to secure not so appealing collaborations.</p>
      <p>It is only pure talent that has done the trick for Jah Signal.</p>
      <p>Fresh from winning a 'Song of the Year' gong at the recent inaugural Star FM Music Awards, Jah Signal's exploits have also been acknowledged in Jamaica. The dancehall singer was an easy pick for a Caribbean nation producer among his peers for a collaboration with Jamaican music greats on the track 'Zimbabwe Peace Song'.</p>
      <p>The track boasts the voices of Tony Rebel, Lt. Stitchie, Queen Ifrica, Tasha T, Chuck Fenda and Exco Levi. But that is hardly the climax - the opportunity is proving to be a career defining moment for the rising star.</p>
      <p>He is set to fly to Jamaica for finalisation of a recording deal with Wurl Trema Records. Part of the deal guarantees more collaborations, music marketing in Caribbean nations and a general recording contract.</p>
      <p>He will also have the privilege to record with an experienced power house band featuring Lia Caribe and Mr Diamond. Wurl Trema is a reputable Jamaican music production company focused on producing Reggae and other Caribbean influenced music. The label also has footsteps in Toronto, Canada and is led by Brenton Messado - a producer/keyboardist for international reggae star Busy Signal.</p>
      <p>Speaking from Jamaica last week, Brenton Messado confirmed they had massive interest in Jah Signal's talent.</p>
      <p>'I chose Jah Signal to be part of the peace song because I wanted a talented person who could speak to the people of Zimbabwe for them to realise that togetherness is peace. I have since invited Jah Signal to Jamaica for more collaborations with our artistes and to see the beauty of Jamaica,' revealed Messado.</p>
      <p>'I would love to get him (Jah Signal) on Wurl Trema Label if that is possible. He is talented and I will connect him with as much Jamaican artistes as possible. Automatic connections are currently available in the form of Tony Rebel, Queen Ifrica, Chuck Fenda, Lt. Stitchie and Exco Levi.</p>
      <p>''I'm also going to connect him with new Jamaican young artistes to bridge the two cultures.'</p>
      <p>Messado does not make secret his respect for Zimbabwe and its people. The seasoned producer has landed in Harare at least three times. First was when he came with Mr Vegas and the other two times he was part of Busy Signal's entourage.</p>
      <p>'I did the apolitical song for Zimbabwe because of the love I have for the country. In as much as we can have the video shoot in Jamaica, I feel it is best we do it in Zimbabwe since the song is about Zimbabwe and should market your tourism attractions.</p>
      <p>'Thus I'm working on bringing all the artistes involved that side. It will be good if all relevant authorities like the Zimbabwe tourism guys take part in the project,' said Messado.</p>
      <p>Jah Signal is upbeat about the developments. He reckons a new chapter is unfolding in his calling.</p>
      <p>'This is a lifetime breakthrough that every artiste wishes to get. The Jamaican connection will help boost my career as I will learn a lot both from legends and upcoming musicians,' said Jah Signal.</p>
      <p>Socialite and music promoter Wanisayi Mutandwa aka Mahwindo, who is part of the Jamaican deal facilitation team notes big things beckon for Jah Signal.</p>
      <p>'Doors are open for Signal because of his talent, hard work, humility and the respect he has for fans and fellow artistes. As it stands we are finalising the paperwork for him to travel to Jamaica. I have some working experience with Jamaican artistes through my mentor Chipaz and I can assure you this is a big deal. His career will never be the same after this,' said Mahwindo.</p>
      <p>Jah Signal's career growth has been phenomenal.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the 'Sweetie' singer won the Best Collaboration Song at the Zim dancehall Awards. Demand for his services skyrocketed and is not only limited to Jamaica's confines. He has also left lasting impressions on stage in Australia, Cyprus, Dubai, South Africa and the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>With support from his manager Hillary 'Punchline' Mutake and fans, the future can only be bright for the singer. Tinmac Foundation, Innocent 'Mhofela' Shito, Nash Paints, Mike Chimombe, Genius 'Ginimbi' Kadungure, Silent Killer Promotions and Boss Dany have all played a hand in financially stabilising the artiste.</p>

      <title>Hallelujah, miracles still happen</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In this weird world we live in, people are entitled to whatever opinion catches their; but it doesn't mean they won't be roasted for having stupid ones. We have these Johnnies coming late into marriage and getting carried away. Easy boys.</p>
      <p>And then there is confusion reigning supreme after that hasty withdrawal of rape charges against Prophet Walter Magaya. While the prophet is now a free man, and I am happy for him, did he rape that unnamed woman or did he not?</p>
      <p>Where to start? Very noisy wedding bells</p>
      <p>Congratulations are in order. Brother Wicknell Chivayo has finally done it. Or has he? Whatever the case, how I wish he made the announcement more modestly, like normal people do, instead of courting unnecessary controversy.</p>
      <p>The blabbermouth took the opportunity to talk down women; Zimbabwean women in particular.</p>
      <p>The chubby fella thinks 'Zimbabwean girls are very disrespectful and stubborn'. Those girls are also guilty of not possessing any intelligence, and hence it's their loss because Chivayo has been taken by a South African Zulu beauty - right under their noses.</p>
      <p>Boy oh boy, the lashing that came thereafter! Zimbabwean women are indeed feisty; we have to give it to them. Poor Chivayo has been crudely reminded of his rather unattractive physique and personality. Talk about hitting way below the belt.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwean ladies are far from heartbroken. They are happy, South Africa has taken him. Ladies, a bit of diplomacy please.</p>
      <p>You don't fight fire with fire lest the whole world burns; more so when you are dealing with a Chivayo whose social intelligence is somewhere between very low and non-existent.</p>
      <p>But since Chivayo ignited this interesting conversation, questions have arisen as to why this 'socialite' is rarely seen in the company of a woman? If he has so little interaction with women, how then is he able to deduce the stubbornness and dullness of Zimbabwean women?</p>
      <p>The outspoken chap always has an answer for everything. I sincerely hope he can field these questions.</p>
      <p>Damascene moments</p>
      <p>Prophetic Healing and Deliverance's Prophet Magaya is a colourful man, and that has nothing to do with his garb. The colour is in his demeanour and the kind of story that follows him.</p>
      <p>Unlike Chivayo, Prophet Magaya seems to think very highly of Zimbabwean women, considering he is always - rightly or wrongly - entangled in their affairs.</p>
      <p>His media-shy and very beautiful wife Tendai seems very respectful, down to earth and intelligent. With her husband facing rape charges in recent months, she has resolutely stood by him and has never publicly questioned his innocence.</p>
      <p>What a woman. But the script is becoming predictable. A woman is said to have been sexually abused or involved with the prophet; the allegations are widely publicised; and then the woman suddenly has her Damascene moment and backtracks.</p>
      <p>Prophet Magaya emerges the victor and victim. People still flock to Prophet Magaya's Waterfalls, Harare base for healing and deliverance.</p>
      <p>Others have received more than prayers. Notorious pole dancer Beverly Sibanda almost left her trade of choice after getting deliverance and a business head start from the man of God.</p>
      <p>Good for her. Years back, Denford Mutashu - husband to Nomsa Ruvazhe - accused the prophet of having an affair with his wife and filed a half-a-million-dollar lawsuit for adultery. And the cat with many lives, Henrietta Rushwaya, also featured in that mini-drama.</p>
      <p>Months later, Mutashu withdrew the charges without giving any reasons. Those who believe in miracles will shout 'Hallelujah!'</p>

      <title>Budget: Mthuli attempts a Houdini act</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube this week unveils his second National Budget statement in which he is expected to announce far-reaching interventions to soothe a nation that has been under austerity measures for over a year.</p>
      <p>Following a year of negative growth characterised by frenzied inflation, declining incomes, shortages of basic goods and volatile currency movements, many have naturally found survival tough going. Austerity has, however, had its share of positives including containment of the national current account and fiscal deficit, including achieving budget surpluses during the first half of the year.</p>
      <p>However, these positives have had negligible trickledown effect to the ordinary people, hence the disenchantment.</p>
      <p>Government, on its part, argues that its plans were thrown off the rails by last season's drought - the worst in two decades - and the Cyclone Idai disaster which hit three provinces. The effects of the drought also manifested through power shortages as water levels in Kariba Dam dwindled to historically low levels.</p>
      <p>Previewing his Budget statement in a recent interview with The Sunday Mail, Prof Ncube said the forthcoming statement would be different from his maiden one and will mark the transition from austerity to growth.</p>
      <p>'Away from austerity, productivity is the theme in the new Budget that we are going to be announcing for 2020,' said Prof Ncube.</p>
      <p>'It is about growth, productivity and improving the environment for ease of doing business.</p>
      <p>'I will have a budget on supporting productivity within industry as a whole.</p>
      <p>'Secondly, supporting productivity in the rural areas; where there is a possibility for investing in the rural areas, we will give an incentive for that. But also, I want to focus on job creation. In the Budget, I will have a proposal to reward the creation of new jobs.'</p>
      <p>Stakeholders who spoke to The Sunday Mail in separate interviews emphasised the need to step out of austerity to stimulus.</p>
      <p>Industry</p>
      <p>Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) president Mr Henry Ruzvidzo said Minister Ncube might need to recalibrate taxation thresholds in order to allow breathing room for struggling industries.</p>
      <p>He said authorities needed to arrest rampant money supply growth as this was fuelling inflation.</p>
      <p>'We expect measures to address decisively the unstable macro-economic environment,' said Mr Ruzvidzo.</p>
      <p>'Money supply growth cannot be allowed to play havoc with all the economic fundamentals. We look forward to incentives that will stimulate production, industry can readily double output provided the right policies are in place.</p>
      <p>'Taxation is a heavy burden, the doing business environment presents many challenges and the instability increases business risk.</p>
      <p>'The economy is using foreign currency for products it has capacity to produce. Thus, the Budget must address this anomaly which has been persistent. Confidence must also be built around our currency and the economy through policy clarity and consistency.'</p>
      <p>Mining</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines chief executive officer Mr Isaac Kwesu said the mining sector presents Zimbabwe with quick wins.</p>
      <p>He said Government needed to follow through with policy proposals contained in the strategic roadmap to the achievement of a US$12 billion mining industry by 2023.</p>
      <p>President Mnangagwa recently launched the roadmap which is projected to increase mining revenue by 344 percent from the US$2,7 billion achieved in 2017.</p>
      <p>'We need to address trajectory issues and challenges affecting viability of the sector so that the sector is placed on a path to sustainable growth,' said Mr Kwesu.</p>
      <p>'The issues include resuscitating closed mines, expanding current operations, and developing new mines requires mobilising adequate funding. We need to address the critical enablers, specifically power outages, so that production is enhanced because without power we cannot produce.</p>
      <p>'There is need to address issues to do with foreign currency retention; we need retention levels that allow the mining industry to have sufficient foreign currency to acquire critical imports such as equipment for expansion, consumables and spares.</p>
      <p>'There must be timeous payment for deliveries especially for gold. There is need for monetary and tax breaks that make us competitive in attracting manpower from other countries.'</p>
      <p>Agriculture</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe Farmers' Union executive director Mr Paul Zakariya said Government needed to consider securitising land tenure to enable farmers to access private funding from banks. He said Government-led funding model under the Smart Agriculture programme should be fine-tuned to allow easier access, by farmers, to inputs directly from suppliers.</p>
      <p>'The best incentive for farmers to be more productive is putting up what they value the most, their land, as security for loans from the banks,' said Mr Zakariya.</p>
      <p>'If a farmer knows the risk of losing land, then they will invest more to produce and make a profit.</p>
      <p>'There must be an introduction of a voucher input scheme comparable with the Zambian input scheme model, which uses an e-voucher system.</p>
      <p>'The farmer has a swipe card into which the government loads the loan. The farmer then redeems the loan at participating agro dealers by selecting the inputs that they need. This takes care of the different farmer input needs.'</p>
      <p>Mr Zakariya said Government should scrap Statutory Instrument 145 of 2019, which criminalises holding of large maize stocks and establishes the Grain Marketing Board as the sole buyer of maize in the country.</p>
      <p>He said such policies were inimical to grain production.</p>
      <p>'The decree makes it a criminal offence to even 'possess' maize in contravention of the regulations, which puts farmers who keep their maize to hedge against currency depreciation at risk of committing an offence,' he said.</p>
      <p>'It creates a ridiculous situation where a farmer who has toiled all year to produce the crop is criminalised for making an economically rational decision to hedge against losses.'</p>
      <p>He said late payments for grain deliveries by the GMB resulted in farmers getting only a fraction of what they were initially supposed to get owing to the volatile currency movements.</p>
      <p>Outlook</p>
      <p>Economist Mr Persistence Gwanyanya said transitioning from austerity to growth would require increased Government spending, particularly on quick responsive sectors.</p>
      <p>He said while austerity had helped rein in Government spending it had failed to stabilise the economy.</p>
      <p>'The policy thrust that underpinned austerity was management strategy to achieve surpluses,' said Mr Gwanyanya.</p>
      <p>'Going forward, that management strategy is changing to achieving some deficit, but within acceptable levels. By doing that, there is a measure of acceptance by Treasury that we need to stimulate the economy. But stimulus will have to be supported by some measure of financial injection.</p>
      <p>'This year, we were expecting a budget deficit of around 4 percent of GDP and we are moving away from surpluses that we achieved in the first half of the year of $803 million, but this year were expecting upwards of $4 billion in terms of a deficit. This means that the thrust of the minister is to move away from the surpluses to deficits which is consistent with the thrust of moving away from austerity to stimulus.</p>
      <p>'The stimulus measures are going to see an increase in money supply in the economy, but this will be supported by a measure of deficit within acceptable levels. There should be a balance of stability and stimulus. For stability, we have to inject money in a measured manner.</p>
      <p>'As we construct a deficit we should do that in a more responsible manner always remembering that we have not yet stabilised the economy. The minister should now identify the areas that have quick and effective responses in stimulating the economy.'</p>

      <title>The war mechanic who risked it all</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>This week we begin a conversation with CDE FRANCIS POTAI (FP), whose nom de guerre was Cde Nyika Muchineripi. At the tender age of 19, he made the taxing journey to Mozambique to train as a freedom fighter. Through sheer determination, he made the journey on foot and alone. He, however, possessed one skill that proved to be invaluable to the war effort. Cde Pota shares his story with NORMAN MUCHEMWA (NM).</p>
      <p>NM: You are one of the fighters who participated in the liberation struggle, can you tell us your name and your early life before joining the liberation struggle?</p>
      <p>FP: My name is Francis Potai. I was born in Zaka in Masvingo province on February 7 1957.</p>
      <p>I went to Madondo Primary School in 1963 - when it was still Sub-A - until 1969 when I completed my Grade Seven. That is the time the syllabus was changing and we were moving from Standard Six to writing Grade Seven.</p>
      <p>I enrolled at St Anthony's Secondary School in Zaka in 1970 for my Form One until the end of the year. I failed to continue with my studies due to financial challenges.</p>
      <p>I am the first born in a family of six from my mother's side, since my father had two wives.</p>
      <p>I joined the liberation struggle in 1976 and my liberation war name was Cde Nyika Muchineripi.</p>
      <p>Before joining the struggle, I worked as a mechanic at Makombe Mubatsiri in Mashava, and had obtained a driver's licence.</p>
      <p>NM: What motivated you to join the liberation struggle at such a young age?</p>
      <p>FT: I joined the liberation struggle beginning of 1976 due to the oppressive environment we were living in, which included mistreatment of blacks by the whites, as well as restrictions on freedom of movement.</p>
      <p>My home area of Zaka is one area liberation fighters operated from and by the time I joined the struggle, comrades were now a permanent feature in our area. Due to the proximity of Zaka to the Mozambican border, we used to listen to Radio Maputo and Voice of Zimbabwe, where we could hear a lot about activities taking place both at the rear and the war front.</p>
      <p>Most of the information was to urge comrades to intensify the war and also to encourage more people to join the struggle.</p>
      <p>Information about why the fighters took up arms was also part of the messages being broadcast at these radio stations. This kind of information and activities in my home area greatly contributed to my desire to join the struggle and fight the regime's oppression.</p>

      <title>Rescue to recovery: Idai in the eyes of a first responder</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>I remember I was at home watching the news with my family. I asked myself how the people in Manicaland were going to cope with the disaster that was all over the news. Little did I know that within a few hours I would be part of a group of first responders.</p>
      <p>I received a call at around 10pm from my supervisor instructing me to pack my bag full of all the emergency essentials (emergency preparedness is the first training staff receive when joining the World Food Programme).</p>
      <p>I then had to tell my family 'duty calls', and that I would be leaving them the next morning. This is the nature of my work, and the time had come to fulfill my mandate of saving lives. One of the first things I packed, after my camera, was my VHF digital radio for communication.</p>
      <p>The next call I got was from the head of WFP's media and communications division at headquarters in Rome who said, 'Tatenda, we hear you are going to Chimanimani and Chipinge early tomorrow morning, are you ready for this task?'</p>
      <p>At first, I didn't answer; I had always admired my colleagues who rushed to help others in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and other hot spots around the world where there is conflict, hunger, famine, floods and war.</p>
      <p>Now here I was, faced with the biggest test in my career. This all raced through my mind while I was on the phone.</p>
      <p>'Tatenda, are you still there?' she asked again, to which I replied, 'Yes, I'm ready, count me in!' The task ahead of me was huge. Mozambique was the first to be hit by Cyclone Idai, just before Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>My colleagues in Mozambique had already started rescuing and delivering food, medicine, and they were updating me with real-time information in a group chat.</p>
      <p>The first stop was at the Provisional Administrator's office in Mutare, to get an update on the situation. I remember the names of the affected communities: Ngangu was one of the worst affected, Kopa had been swept away, Skyline, Wengezi, Silverstream, Mutambara were cut off from the bigger communities. People needed food, medicine and shelter, and there I was: holding a camera in one hand and a backpack in the other.</p>
      <p>'Are you here for rescue or tourism? Please, out of my way,' bellowed a certain gentleman who was co-ordinating the movement of everything at the Mutare aerodrome.</p>
      <p>At 2pm, one of the biggest helicopters ever built was scheduled to touch down at the base, and was to take me to the epicenter of the cyclone. With my little knowledge of aviation, I had assumed it would be a light aircraft.</p>
      <p>The majestic MI8 helicopter after landing in Chimanimani</p>
      <p>I checked my phone for time. It had one bar of battery left and was about to die on me, since power lines had been cut off by the harsh winds. Next thing I knew, the deafening sound of the helicopter announced its arrival.</p>
      <p>People say WFP is the biggest logistics organisation in the world, and watching that monster land, I believed them. It was built for war, I said to myself. 'Yes,' one of the pilots replied, 'it was built to fight hunger in such emergencies'.</p>
      <p>Since WFP was stamped on the helicopter, and I was wearing my WFP vest and cap, the person who accused me of being a tourist rushed to me and said, 'are you one of the pilots of this helicopter?' I told them that I was not, and that I had come to help deliver food and medicine to the affected communities.</p>
      <p>After refueling, getting the co-ordinates of the affected communities and reviewing the local aviation regulations, we were up in the sky. Part of our cargo was for pregnant women who had had complications during delivery. I later on learnt one of the women and her baby survived, and she named the baby Faith.</p>
      <p>As we flew over Chimanimani, I felt tears in my eyes. I recall flying over a graveyard there, with so many freshly dug graves.</p>
      <p>As the helicopter touched down, I expected to see kids running to inspect it, as everyone was doing in Mutare. This time was different. I saw terrified faces.</p>
      <p>As we were ushered across Ngangu, a place where more than 90 lives were lost in one night, I couldn't believe what I saw. To think that this happened at night, when people were asleep, broke my heart.</p>
      <p>Cyclone Idai devastated the road and bridge infrastructure in Chimanimani and Chipinge. This is one of the reconstructed bridges</p>
      <p>One older woman rushed to me and asked me whether there would be another cyclone in the next 24 hours. I told her there wouldn't be, but I could tell she didn't believe me. In our culture, it is believed lightning always strikes the same place twice.</p>
      <p>I came across a woman who had just lost her baby but had discovered its clothes in the rubble. She was so hopeful her daughter was alive. 'Mothers,' I thought to myself. Unfortunately, she never saw her baby again, and those clothes were her only reminder of her daughter.</p>
      <p>At this point, I told myself, that the best thing I could do would be to refrain from asking people what had happened to them during the cyclone, because I would be re-opening their wounds.</p>
      <p>Deep down in my heart I felt something, I was sad. I thought of the family I had left at home, but I reassured myself that my family was safe, and these people needed WFP's help, they needed my help.</p>
      <p>I spent the next few days in the cyclone-affected areas helping and making sure that those back in Harare, Johannesburg, Rome and the entire world would know what had happened here. The information I gathered helped WFP fund-raise, and assist those in need.</p>
      <p>Naturally, after this experience, Manicaland became my second home. The faces I saw just after the cyclone and now are different. It's devastating to lose loved ones and livelihoods at the same time. Those affected by the cyclone have been resilient; they have picked up pieces of their lives and are working to put them back together thanks to the support by the Zimbabwean Government, donors and implementation partners.</p>
      <p>A year later, the writer travels back to Chimanimani to check on the progress the community has made in normalising their livelihoods</p>
      <p>WFP responded swiftly and innovatively during the Cyclone Idai emergency in these early months of 2019. Beginning with an initial rapid response that supplied 50 000 of the affected people with 90-day nutrition-sensitive food assistance in the form of specialised nutritious foods mainly targeted at the most vulnerable including children under-five and pregnant and lactating women.</p>
      <p>In Phase 2, WFP and its partners provided a full food basket to 220 000 individuals in the affected districts and supported recovery activities.</p>
      <p>It's true that no mountain is too big or, valley too deep for WFP to reach. When such a disaster like Cyclone Idai hits, we are the first to arrive and the last to leave. We make sure that no-one is left behind, and we always start with the most vulnerable.</p>
      <p>The WFP has distributed food baskets to 220 000 individuals in the Cyclone Idai affected districts</p>
      <p>My experience responding to the cyclone seems like yesterday, but a year has gone by. There are many heroes and heroines who will never be recognised for their tireless, dedicated work. These are the people of Manicaland. The neighbours who rushed the whole night to rescue their friends and relatives. Some lost their lives or limbs trying to help others.</p>
      <p>It's not very often I get calls from WFP headquarters, but last week I received another call from the head of our media and communications division. This time she said 'are you ready? We have another assignment for you, we want you to cover the same subject, climate change, but this time, the drought that has affected Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>My answer didn't change. It will always be the same: 'When do you want me on the ground?' These calls are a call to duty. This is the same story for many humanitarians around the world. We keep going, we do what needs to be done, because that is who we are.</p>
      <p>At such a time when the world is facing a critical test our executive director, David Beasley, summed it by saying: 'we can't afford not to do our job, no matter what virus is knocking at our door.'</p>

    <text>
      <p>KALISTO PASUWA is worried his Nyasa Big Bullets players might suffer from fatigue after the Malawian champions travelled by road from Blantyre to Harare on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After travelling for about 600 km, Nyasa Bullets who face Zimbabwe champions FC Platinum in a Caf Champions League preliminary round second leg at Barbourfields in Bulawayo on Saturday, arrived in Harare around at 7PM on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>They trained at the National Sports Stadium on Thursday morning before heading off to Bulawayo by road in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Nyasa Bullets, who use an artificial turf at their Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre are expected to get a feel of the grass pitch at Barbourfields on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Pasuwa, who led the Bullets to a 0-0 draw against FC Platinum in the first leg fears fatigue might creep into his charges ahead of the decisive second leg.</p>
      <p>'So far so good but it's the fatigue side of it, we trained in the morning (Thursday) and you could see the legs are heavy.</p>
      <p>'We are trying our best and see how we can manage this with the doctors,' Pasuwa told the media on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>'We have one player Msowoya (Chiukepo), he didn't even train, he has a hamstring and that's a setback on our side.</p>
      <p>'With the other guys, the 21 we are have, they are okay, we will have to see tomorrow (Friday) when we train in the pitch we are using for the match.</p>
      <p>'Today (Thursday) we trained on the grass surface and also the grass was as good as BF and you could see some of the boys trying to adapt to it but the speed was slow. We will see again when we train at Barbourfields,' added Pasuwa.</p>
      <p>Pasuwa's youthful side played a neat passing game in the first leg in Malawi and his team is fancying its chances of progressing to the next round where either UD Songo of Mozambique or Simba Stars of Tanzania are awaiting.</p>
      <p>Nyasa Big Bullets have over five players who play for the Malawian national team.</p>

      <title>We can win the fight against cancer</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The World Cancer Day (WCD) was born out of the Paris Charter that was adopted at the World Summit against Cancer for the New Millennium on February 4 2000.</p>
      <p>The Charter was designed to promote research for curing, preventing, improving patient services, sensitising common opinion and mobilising the global community against cancer.</p>
      <p>Article 10 of the Charter set February 4 as World Cancer Day so that the Charter of Paris would remain in the hearts and minds of people around the world.</p>
      <p>As the world commemorates WCD this year under the theme 'I am and I will', it is imperative for us to share information about the current cancer situation in Zimbabwe so that we all work together in reducing the national cancer burden.</p>
      <p>A lot can be done in areas of cancer prevention, early detection, treatment and care.</p>
      <p>In particular, this year's WCD theme - I am and I will - challenges us to bear in mind that each one of us has a role to play in fighting cancer.</p>
      <p>In essence, it calls us to realise our potential and make a personal commitment to reduce the national cancer burden.</p>
      <p>Cancer is now acknowledged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Zimbabwe, with over 7 000 new cancer cases and over 2 000 deaths being recorded per year.</p>
      <p>It continues to be on the increase in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>According to the Zimbabwe National Cancer Registry's Annual Report for 2015, a total of 7165 cases - comprising 3 041 males (42,4 percent) and 4 124 females (57,6 percent) - were reported.</p>
      <p>Also, a total of 250 childhood cancers - 147 boys (58,3 percent) and 105 girls (41,7 percent) were registered in the same year.</p>
      <p>The number of deaths recorded in 2015 in Harare were 2 651.</p>
      <p>The five leading cancers in Zimbabwe are: cancer of the cervix, prostate, breast, kaposi sarcoma, non-melanoma skin cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</p>
      <p>These alarming statistics are, however, widely acknowledged as conservative as many cancer cases escape the National Health Information System (NHIS) because many patients do not seek modern treatment due to myths and misconceptions about cancer.</p>
      <p>Further, it is believed that all deaths attributable to the disease are not captured as many patients die before being diagnosed due to highly centralised cancer screening and unaffordable diagnosis services.</p>
      <p>The few patients who present themselves for treatment usually do so very late when cancer is at advanced stages, resulting in little chances of treatment success.</p>
      <p>Summary of the cancer situation in Zimbabwe</p>
      <p>Decentralisation of cervical cancer screening services by Government and its partners.</p>
      <p>Cancer Association of Zimbabwe is very supportive of this initiative and, therefore, urges more partners to come on board and help in providing this important service to rural communities.</p>
      <p>Continued increase in new cancer cases (incidence).</p>
      <p>Cancer is becoming a generalised disease unlike before and increase in cancer cases among the general population of Zimbabwe is putting pressure on the available cancer service centres and public health institutions.</p>
      <p>HIV-related cancers are on the increase.</p>
      <p>In fact, almost 60 percent of all new cancer cases are HIV and AIDS-related.</p>
      <p>Most of the reported cancer cases are diagnosed late.</p>
      <p>In fact, 80 percent of the cases are reported very late at the health institutions, resulting in less chances of treatment success and high cost of treatment. Early detection and appropriate treatment not only improves prognosis, but also reduces the cost of treatment.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of myths and misconceptions on cancer among the general population of Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>These myths and misconceptions are acting as barriers to cancer prevention, early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
      <p>The most common myth is that cancer cannot be treated using the conventional treatment methods and this often results in patients presenting their cases late.</p>
      <p>Though not ascertained as of now, it cannot be doubted that some of the cancer patients are falling prey to some individuals who claim to cure cancer using unproven treatment and unapproved treatment methods. We, therefore, urge cancer clients to make sure that they get the right treatment advice from accredited medical practitioners.</p>
      <p>Late commencement of treatment even when diagnosed of cancer due to both myths and misconceptions on cancer treatment and unaffordability of the cost of treatment.</p>
      <p>Cancer education, screening, diagnosis and treatment services remain highly centralised in major towns.</p>
      <p>Hidden cost of cancer.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that cancer diagnosis and treatment cost is relatively high, there are other 'hidden costs' to cancer that the poor and rural cancer patients have to endure. These hidden costs include:</p>
      <p>The cost of travelling long distances to access cancer screening and treatment services.</p>
      <p>Accommodation and meals in urban areas during diagnosis and treatment far way from home.</p>
      <p>Recommendations for the national cancer intervention</p>
      <p>Extensive cancer education programmes to counter the current myths and misconceptions about cancer which are acting as barriers to cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
      <p>Subsidised cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment services and improving the capacity of provincial and district public health institutions in cancer management.</p>
      <p>National Cancer Policy</p>
      <p>Decentralisation of cancer information dissemination, screening, diagnosis and treatment services</p>
      <p>Multi-sectoral approach in the management of cancer</p>
      <p>Sustainable financial resource mobilisation for comprehensive national cancer programmes.</p>
      <p>More local research on cancer is required to guide national cancer intervention.</p>
      <p>Cancer knows no boundary; we, therefore, need to come together as one in order to win the fight against cancer.</p>
      <p>We have to make our individual personal commitment to fighting cancer in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>If we all do that and translate all our commitments into action, we will win the fight against cancer.</p>

      <title>Dhlakama, the unsung hero</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>IN every revolution, there are always some unsung heroes, those men and women who never get the credit they deserve.</p>
      <p>For Zimbabwe's football, one such hero is Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Rodwell Dhlakama (pictured right). Dhlakama's modesty belies the years of hard work he has put in identifying and nurturing many talented players since his days as a schoolteacher.</p>
      <p>Some of his products have grown to become stars.</p>
      <p>As the Warriors regroup ahead of a fresh Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign, a number of players told The Sunday Mail Sport how Dhlakama has impacted on their lives.</p>
      <p>Some of the notable names thaat have passed through the hands of the unassuming coach include skipper Knowledge Musona, Khama Billiat, Tino Kadewere, Erick Chipeta, Ovidy Karuru, Mathew Rusike, Onismo Bhasera, Washington Arubi, Kingston Nkata and the Mubaiwa twins - Peter and Patrick.</p>
      <p>The long list also includes Evans Rusike, Abbas Amidu, Qadr Amini, George Chigova, Rodrick Mutuma, Brighton Mugoni, Chank Marion and Asani Nhongo.</p>
      <p>He even 'adopted' some of the players and paid their school fees.</p>
      <p>As a result, some of his protégés refer to him as 'father'. The new first choice goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze, together with former Dynamos striker Rodrick Mutuma, who is currently plying his trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo under FC Lupopo, are some of beneficiaries of Dhlakama's bursary.</p>
      <p>Mutuma said: 'Dhlakama is my dad, he started staying with me when I was doing Form Three. I was still in Mvuma, that is when he started paying my school fees. He bought me my first pair of football boots.</p>
      <p>'After that, he took me to Dynamos and was involved with my move to South Africa. He was also involved with my move to DRC.</p>
      <p>'As kids we are bound to be naughty, but I will always look up to him for advice,' said Mutuma. Dhlakama also took Chipezeze into his custody when he was still playing for Timmy Football Academy and attending Mkoba 7 Secondary School in Gweru.</p>
      <p>'I started staying with coach Dhlakama when I was around 17. He paid my school fees and instilled a lot of confidence in me. To be honest, he made me the player I am today,' said the Baroka goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Chipezeze's predecessor, Chigova, was plucked during an Under-17 tournament in Bulawayo. Chigova and Dhlakama found themselves having to sleep at Mbare Musika bus terminus after arriving from the tournament late at night.</p>
      <p>'He believes in me. He saw me playing for How Mine FC juniors in an Under-17 tournament and invited me to come with him to the national Under-17 team. We spent the better part of the night at Mbare Musika, before meeting Julius Chifokoyo, then chairman of the now defunct Caps FC. I would go and stay at his house in Shurugwi. He is not just a coach, he is a father to me. I remember him telling my parents not to worry as he was going to take care of me, he did honour his promise.</p>
      <p>'He is the one who recommended me to Aces Youth Academy, where I was signed,' said Chigova. Not only has Dhlakama managed to deal with Mutuma, one of Zimbabwe football's bad-boys. Somehow he has also found a way to breathe life into the 2013 national team captain Denver Mukamba's career again.</p>
      <p>'To be honest, Dhlakama has done a lot for me, both on and off the field. He has stood by me since he called me up for the Under-17 national team camp. Had it not been for him, I do not think I would be playing in the Premier League. He counselled and told me that I should be back to where I belong.</p>
      <p>'Early this year when I was struggling to get a team, he gave me another chance to revive my career at Chapungu. I listened to him and I think another dance with the Warriors can be a reality,' said Mukamba.</p>
      <p>Despite all these feats, Dhlakama remains grounded. 'You have to do your job, not for public approval, but as part of your social responsibility and self-fulfilling prophecy,'' Dhlakama said.</p>
      <p>Among other achievements, Dhlakama holds the record of being the only local football coach who has won the Annual National Sports Awards Coach of the Year gong.</p>
      <p>'In terms of achievement statistics, I won seven gold medals with the Under-20 and Under-17 Zimbabwe national teams. I also won two Zimbabwe Youth Games with Midlands Province.</p>
      <p>'I have coached all the junior national teams, from the Under 15 to Under 23,' said Dhlakama.</p>

      <title>Chikoko's big year</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>IN his wildest of dreams, Zimbabwe basketball captain Vitalis Chikoko might not have envisaged waking up one day being the French league's best player.</p>
      <p>On May 30, that seemingly far-fetched dream became a reality when the 29-year old received news of his treble, having been named Player of the Year, Centre of the Year and Cotonou Player of the Year in the EuroBasket All-French ProA 2020 Awards.</p>
      <p>'I woke up to several messages from my agent; one of them telling me that I had just won a couple of awards,' said the Boulogne-Levallois Centre.</p>
      <p>'I had a great season this year and the goal was to improve from my MVP runners-up finish last year.</p>
      <p>'So this win was really huge in that it is the result of the work I put into improving my game,' he said.</p>
      <p>To cap a fine season, Chikoko also paid the bride price for his high school sweetheart - Francisca Nyaradzo Nhongonhema.</p>
      <p>In fact, news of the awards came on the day he was scheduled to be customarily married.</p>
      <p>'Getting married was the highlight of my day. I had a pleasant trip to my wife's homestead and the proceedings went well.</p>
      <p>'They were nice to me, welcomed me and before long I was a married man,' he said.</p>
      <p>Chikoko has known his soul-mate for the past eight years, having met during his days at high school.</p>
      <p>'We will be celebrating our eighth anniversary on June 15, having met during my days at Churchill (Boys High).</p>
      <p>'We went to Masvingo for a basketball tournament and it was during that trip that we became acquainted, exchanged numbers and started communicating.</p>
      <p>'When she then moved to Harare, we then started dating and have been together since.</p>
      <p>'This (lobola) was something I have been looking forward to for some time and I am glad that the day came and passed without a hitch.'</p>
      <p>The couple has already started planning for a wedding, with a basketball theme not totally off the table.</p>
      <p>'We have only started talking about a possible wedding with the wife and nothing is cast in stone or off the table yet.</p>
      <p>'A basketball-themed wedding is possible,' he said.</p>
      <p>With customary proceedings out of the way, Chikoko now turns his attention to the one thing that has eluded him since he left for Europe some nine years ago - a championship medal.</p>
      <p>'I really thought that this would be the year. I have come close a couple of times - missing out in Italy and Germany.</p>
      <p>'At Tenezis Verona, I went as far as the semi-finals, while at Bayern Munich we lost in Game Seven of the finals, so I really want that title.'</p>
      <p>Still in his first season with Levallois, Chikoko carried the weight of the French capital side on his shoulders, and thought that this was to be his year.</p>
      <p>'During our negotiations, the Levallois told me right off the bat that I was to be the franchise player of the team, and I carried that into the season.</p>
      <p>'We were in playoff contention, fourth on the log table and were playing some good basketball. We won most of our big games and struggled against some of the smaller teams, but that is something that could have been rectified,' he said.</p>
      <p>Sadly, coronavirus intervened and put a stop to all sporting activities, with only 25 games played.</p>
      <p>Chikoko has an interesting tale to tell, as he is one of the fortunate few to have escaped the extreme lockdowns, not once, but twice.</p>
      <p>'I left France literally hours before the lockdown began and went to visit my wife and relatives in South Africa.</p>
      <p>'There, I also managed to escape the lockdown by a few hours and made my way back home. Here, I have had the pleasure of having all my family and close friends with me during the local lockdown.'</p>
      <p>During that time, he has been busy working on his game in preparation for the resumption of basketball action in September.</p>
      <p>'We managed to outvote the coaches and general managers, and will start playing again in September, which is when all sporting activities will resume in France.</p>
      <p>'In the meantime, I have been working with coach Russy (Tawanda Nemutambwe), and working on my fitness, too.</p>
      <p>'I spend about four hours a day either working out or on drills.</p>
      <p>'My routine mostly revolves around a two-hour workout in the morning and another one in the evening.</p>
      <p>'I know that after these awards, everyone will be gunning for me and I want to be ready,' he said.</p>

      <title>Zesa board ready to wield the axe</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The new Zesa Holdings board says it is sharpening its swords for a brutal fight against misgovernance at the State-owned power utility, especially alleged corruption in tender awards and nepotism.</p>
      <p>Further, the new board, led by former Cottco managing director Mr Collins Chihuri, plans to ensure stable and consistent power supplies.</p>
      <p>The board, which would sign performance contracts, also intends to successfully complete electricity generation projects currently underway such as the US$1,4 billion Hwange Power Station Expansion, which will add 600MW to the grid.</p>
      <p>Government appointed a seven-member board for Zesa on March 19, made up of Engineer Benson Munyaradzi, Ms Jacqueline Sande, Mr Trust Chifamba, Mr Hussein Omar, Mrs Cathrine Befura and Mr Thomas Timire.</p>
      <p>On the day of appointment, Energy and Power Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo, said the board has several tasks that include superintending over the re-bundling process of Zesa, eliminating corruption and completing ongoing power projects.</p>
      <p>Mr Chihuri told The Sunday Mail Business that while the task awaiting them at Zesa is gigantic, it would only be overcame if all members pulled in the same direction.</p>
      <p>'Certainly as the minister said, there are great challenges but the challenges are not insurmountable as long as we put in good effort,' said Mr Chihuri.</p>
      <p>He promised that the new board will hit the ground running, and largely look at ensuring that power is available for both domestic and commercial consumers. Zimbabwe has not had load shedding since December 2015 mainly due to investments in new energy projects and refurbishments of existing infrastructure, particularly since 2009.</p>
      <p>'We will certainly look at making power availability a core issue. Since 2015 there have been no challenges, so it's one aspect we have to ensure that it's maintained.</p>
      <p>'There are also big projects underway, and our task is to ensure that we support them. We also have to look at corruption and other governance shortcomings. Certainly, we have to look at such issues. So it's a big task but we are equal to the task,' said Mr Chihuri.</p>
      <p>Tackling corruption will test the resolve of the new board to the limit.</p>
      <p>Zesa has had the tag of having the 'most corrupt' officials stuck on it for a long time.</p>
      <p>Management has previously been accused of offering themselves humongous salaries and perquisites (incidental benefits) even at a time when the entity was not operating profitably and efficiently.</p>
      <p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of management colluding with board members to corruptly award tenders either to their 'friends' or companies that are amenable to paying kick-backs.</p>
      <p>This has adversely affected the power utility's operations, resulting in it turning to Government for financial assistance. But Mr Chihuri says the board will have to look at itself in the mirror, and ensure they operate above board.</p>
      <p>'As a board, we have to be clean individuals and I have always said you can't legislate for integrity. Those are some of the issues we want to fight.</p>
      <p>'For me, integrity is key. We just have to come in and drive our members to ensure that we have a clean team throughout,' said Mr Chihuri.</p>
      <p>Asked how they plan to roll-out their activities, Mr Chihuri said: 'We have just been appointed and we should have plans in the next few weeks or a month on how we are going to execute our mandate.</p>
      <p>'For now, we have just come in, we need to see the business, where the business was and then we will be able to take a trajectory going forward.'</p>
      <p>In line with the Transitional Stabilisation Plan (TSP), Government has set in motion plans to re-bundle ZESA Holdings, which was first unbundled in 1997 and later in 2006.</p>
      <p>The unbundling created five companies, namely Powertel Communications, Zimbabwe Electricity and Transmission Distribution Company (ZETDC), Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), Zesa Enterprises (Zent) and Zesa Holdings.</p>
      <p>Further, Government set up the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) and the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera).</p>
      <p>The move is thought to have exerted more costs on the company and the tariff, as all executives earn huge salaries and obnoxious perks such as top-of-the-range vehicles and loans to buy houses.</p>
      <p>Cabinet believes re-bundling ZESA will ensure the power utility is managed as one entity and ceases to be 'top heavy', which would potentially bring efficiencies.</p>
      <p>Experts also believe that ZESA's push for a 30 percent tariff increase is in tandem with the pronouncements in the February 20 Monetary Policy Statement, which liberalised foreign currency trading.</p>

      <title>Parliament is an essential service</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE novel coronavirus is providing a formidable test to democracy the world over.</p>
      <p>Even in 'tempered' democracies, institutions, longstanding democratic conventions, norms and traditions are feeling the wrath of the pandemic.</p>
      <p>Governments around the world are imposing draconian edicts, which include declarations of state of emergencies and strict state-wide lockdowns, impacting on citizens' political and socio-economic rights.</p>
      <p>Daily, civilians who breach these diktats are being subjected to summary street beatings, arrests and in extreme cases shootings.</p>
      <p>Excesses are flourishing and democracy is paying the price.</p>
      <p>At the centre of this existential threat to democracy is the partial suspension, in the interest of public health, of key institutions in the support of democracy -parliaments and the courts.</p>
      <p>In Zimbabwe, for example, both Houses of Parliament have adjourned until Tuesday May 5 or later if necessary.</p>
      <p>Courts have also been partially closed.</p>
      <p>Only urgent matters, bail applications and initial remands are being heard, while trials and non-urgent hearings are postponed for the next two months.</p>
      <p>For Parliament, all international travel, committee meetings and public hearings stand cancelled.</p>
      <p>Only approved field visits, where numbers of the travelling party are 50 or below, are allowed.</p>
      <p>All other meetings will be considered by the Clerk of Parliament on a case-by-case basis.</p>
      <p>The apparent curtailment of the operations of these two key institutions, albeit in the best interest of public health, should not abrogate their responsibilities in providing checks and oversight. Zimbabwe, like any other democracy worldwide, is threatened by the pandemic in ways unprecedented, and means have to be found to protect these institutions and ensure they perform as close to optimum levels as possible.</p>
      <p>This is not to suggest that the Executive has taken advantage of the current status quo to impose unreasonable or patently undemocratic decrees. No!</p>
      <p>In fact, what we have observed has been a measured approach, which is in tandem with international best practices and World Health Organisation guidelines.</p>
      <p>This, however, does not mean we do not have to prop up these two institutions, even under the current difficult circumstances.</p>
      <p>In fact, the need to establish a precedent for posterity when dealing with such disasters cannot be overemphasised.</p>
      <p>Scientists predict an increase of similarly disruptive disasters in future mainly as a result of climate change, meaning the time to set precedent is now. Experiences from other jurisdictions could be instructive here.</p>
      <p>One option authorities can consider during the lockdown and in the interest of nurturing our democracy is to declare Parliament an essential service.</p>
      <p>'Essential services' are services whose interruption would endanger the life, health or personal safety of the whole or part of the population.</p>
      <p>But, according to two recent Statutory Instruments gazetted by Government, only funeral parlour operators and coffin manufacturers and sellers; manufacturers and distributors of medical supplies relevant to combat Covid-19 and other medical emergencies; suppliers of agricultural inputs and stockfeed; suppliers and distributors of veterinary requirements for domesticated farm and non-farm animals, and cattle dipping were declared essential services.</p>
      <p>Others include producers and retailers of essential goods, food shops, pharmacies and informal food markets, power and water supplies, and public transport by Zupco and the Public Service Commission.</p>
      <p>Section 119 of our Constitution makes it clear that: 'All institutions and agencies of the State and Government at every level are accountable to Parliament.'</p>
      <p>This illustrates the importance of Parliament in our democracy and why it should be considered an essential service.</p>
      <p>After all, institutions of the State (including those at the forefront of fighting the coronavirus pandemic) are accountable to Parliament.</p>
      <p>It is only Parliament that can ensure that all resources mobilised for the fight against the coronavirus are being invested in the right places and expose all instances of abuse and corruption.</p>
      <p>It is the duty of Parliament to shine the light on the operations of those that have been instructed to lead our fight against the pandemic.</p>
      <p>South Africa has led the way in this regard, with MPs being declared providers of essential services during their lockdown.</p>
      <p>Only last week, their Select Committee on Security and Justice released a report censuring some rogue security sector officials deployed to enforce the lockdown accused of ill-conduct. Parliamentarians there are also leading the fight through community education campaigns promoting social distancing.</p>
      <p>Virtual Parliament</p>
      <p>Developed jurisdictions have begun experimenting with the idea of video conferencing as they grapple to find a balance between scrutiny/oversight and safety.</p>
      <p>The argument here is that our elected representatives need to continue to fulfil their responsibilities.</p>
      <p>In an era where all global businesses operate using teleconferences, the board meetings of many companies, large and small, are likewise held online.</p>
      <p>Why should this also not be the case with our Parliament, probably starting small with committees?</p>
      <p>In the United Kingdom, virtual committees have already been trialled successfully and the idea may soon be extended to include the entire houses.</p>
      <p>The Welsh Assembly - the Senedd -became the first major democratic institution to meet remotely a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Members used Zoom video conferencing to meet virtually from across Wales for the weekly plenary session, which usually takes place in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>The South African Parliament is toying with the idea as well.</p>
      <p>The Sothern African Development Community (Sadc) has already led the way with the convening of a Sadc Council of Ministers via video conferencing last month.</p>
      <p>'We welcome the suspension of the face-to-face meeting and the holding of Sadc Council meeting via video conferencing,' said Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo after the meeting.</p>
      <p>'Tanzania has hooked and connected 15 0member states where we are having a meeting as usual and this is a process we believe would enhance a lot of conferences in Sadc by adopting technology.'</p>
      <p>This is the way to go.</p>

      <title>Private sector confident in ED</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Zimbabwe's private sector has expressed confidence in President Mnangagwa's administration, saying it has the capacity to turn around the country's economic fortunes to achieve middle-income economy status by 2030.</p>
      <p>Since coming into office in November 2017 and following the 2018 harmonised elections, President Mnangagwa has pledged to turn around the country's economic fortunes.</p>
      <p>Even at events where politics is ordinarily supposed to take centre stage, the President has not missed the opportunity to remind Zimbabweans, and the world at large, that Zimbabwe is open for business and that his administration is working hard to rebuild the economy.</p>
      <p>This focus on the economy has been welcomed by the business community. Innscor Africa Limited, one of the country's single largest conglomerates with interests across the retail, agro-processing, agro-industrial and manufacturing sectors, has expressed confidence in the new dispensation's capacity. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) listed entity has said it is happy that President Mnangagwa's Government is directing its energy towards the economy.</p>
      <p>'We are extremely encouraged by the policies outlined by the country's new leadership and it is clear that all key stakeholders must become aligned if these policies are to be successfully implemented,' said Innscor's chairman, Mr Addington Chinake.</p>
      <p>Mr Chinake said the Group is witnessing the positive impact of Government's policies.</p>
      <p>'The economy has started to show some growth, evidenced by good levels of volumes across our platforms over the past few months,' he said.</p>
      <p>Innscor said it will continue to support Government's policies aimed at making the country more self-sufficient through initiatives such as contract farming of maize, wheat and soya beans as well as identification of opportunities to increase local production of milk.</p>
      <p>As a show of confidence, Innscor is also looking at expanding its operations to meet 'increasing demand.</p>
      <p>'We are extremely optimistic with regards to the country's growth potential and have commenced expansion projects in each of the individual businesses to meet increasing demand.'</p>
      <p>He said in order to sustain the Group's current growth rate and associated imported raw material requirements, it will also be imperative to evaluate investment opportunities with large export potential, even if they are outside the Group's current focus.</p>
      <p>Growing and diversifying the export sector is one of Government's economic thrust amid efforts to grow foreign currency earnings, which has become an impediment to growing the economy.</p>
      <p>Also impressed by what is happening in the economy is hotelier Rainbow Tourism Group, with chairman Mr Sijabuliso Biyam saying the business is 'encouraged by the opportunities that are being presented by an economy that is opening up to the world.'</p>
      <p>In a statement accompanying the Group's financial results, Mr Biyam said tourism globally depends on a strong and positive nation brand that guarantees travellers their safety, security and unique experiences.</p>
      <p>'The changes that have taken place, culminating in a successful holding of the country's elections, have sent the right message to the world.</p>
      <p>The upgrading of core infrastructure around the country, including airports, roads and hotels will go a long way in generating enhanced revenues for the industry and business,' he said.</p>
      <p>Quick services restaurant company, Simbisa, also expressed optimism that 'stabilisation in the socio-political environment and the impending economic reform in the wake of elections will pave the way for continued growth and new opportunities.'</p>
      <p>Listed insurance company, Fidelity Life, added its voice on positive developments in the country, saying economic reforms and international re-engagement remain at the core of the out-turn of the Zimbabwean economy in the medium to long term.</p>
      <p>Businessman and chief executive officer of Impala car rental, Dr Thompson Dondo praised President Mnangagwa for bringing in a new work ethic in Government.</p>
      <p>He also called on the private sector to support Government in its endeavours.</p>
      <p>'The private sector must not only give President Mnangagwa and his Cabinet a chance to revive the economy, we must also play a part as business and support them.</p>
      <p>Dr Dondo captured the anxiety that is in the country and encouraged the nation to be patient.</p>
      <p>'So much is expected from this Government such that some people are expecting miracles within a few weeks.</p>
      <p>They want bank queues for cash to immediately disappear.</p>
      <p>They want jobs immediately. They want pay increases immediately.</p>
      <p>Measures are being put in place and results will start showing in due course,' he said.</p>
      <p>Work still to be done</p>
      <p>Fidelity Life chairman Mr Fungai Ruwende said if the country is to brighten its economic prospects, Government has to be intentional and forward looking in implementing measures that will stabilise the challenging and unsettled economic environment that industry is currently operating in.</p>
      <p>The same sentiments were shared by Axia chairman Mr Luke Ngwerume.</p>
      <p>In a statement accompanying the Group's financial results, Mr Ngwerume said the Group is hopeful that in the 'medium to long term, the country will restore business confidence and offer good prospects for sustainable growth despite the current prevailing economic realities.'</p>
      <p>Some of the biggest challenges still faced by businesses include but are not limited to foreign currency shortages to import adequate raw materials as well as the high cost of doing business.</p>
      <p>But with the election phase now behind us, business is happy that attention is now directed towards resolving some of the challenges facing the economy.</p>
      <p>National Foods, one of the leading players in the provision of basic commodities, said the direct and increasing impact that some of these issues are having on the business are damaging and not sustainable.</p>
      <p>Due to the limited availability of foreign currency, the company's position with its foreign creditors deteriorated significantly over the year, with US$37,59 million remaining outstanding to foreign wheat suppliers at the end of the period.</p>
      <p>'It is crucial that a solution for this debt is found in the immediate future,' chairman Mr Todd Moyo said in a statement accompanying the Group's financial results.</p>
      <p>'Provided that meaningful solutions to these challenges can be found, we believe that there will be significant opportunities to supply a broader range of categories as economic conditions and the position of the consumer improve further,' said Mr Moyo.</p>

      <title>Gamecocks keep the pressure</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>CHICKEN Inn maintained the pressure on Castle Lager Premier Soccer League log leaders FC Platinum when they subdued a fighting Bulawayo Chiefs in a lukewarm clash at Luveve yesterday. Two second-half goals from captain Moses Jackson and midfielder Innocent Mucheneka were enough to give the Gamecocks three points and ensure they keep pace with Platinum, who are two points ahead after beating Chapungu yesterday.</p>
      <p>Despite dominating possession, Chicken Inn struggled to create any meaningful clear cut chances in the first half.</p>
      <p>Chiefs gave them a scare two minutes from half-time as they came close to break the deadlock with a string of chances. However, it was not to be.</p>
      <p>Following the introduction of Clemence Matawu in place of Malvin Gaki, the 2015 champions came back an invigorated side in the second half.</p>
      <p>Matawu brought some creativity in the Chicken Inn attack and they were rewarded in the 57th minute when Jackson slotted into an empty net after Chiefs goalkeeper, Liberty Chirava, had failed to clear a cross from Mucheneka.</p>
      <p>Chiefs Farau Matare could have levelled the scores in the 62nd minute after he managed to outpace Chicken Inn defenders in a counter attack but his strike saw the ball coming off goalkeeper, Donovan Bernard, thereby earning Amakhosi Amahle a corner.</p>
      <p>Chicken Inn's forays saw an industrious Obrey Chirinda delivering a pass that met Mucheneka at the far end. He made it two in the 75th minute.</p>
      <p>Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas was happy with the win that came after a loss to Hwange last week. 'We are happy to bounce back after falling to Hwange last week. The win ensures that we keep up the pressure on FC Platinum. The plan is to grind results in our next games and try to hit a consistent cord.</p>
      <p>'It was a tricky encounter as Chiefs kept running for the whole 90 minutes, they are a difficult team to play. We were slow in the first half and made a lot of stray passing. We were losing every second ball. Chiefs were much better in the last 10 to 15 minutes as they created meaningful chances. However, they failed to punish us.</p>
      <p>'The second half was a different story when we introduced Matawu, who stabilised us and was our creative hub,' he said.</p>
      <p>Chiefs head coach Farai Tawachera was of the view the match outcome shows the difference in the quality of players from the two sides.</p>
      <p>'This game showed that quality will win it for you. It was the quality of the players that made the difference in this game.</p>
      <p>'We played well but failed to bury the chances we created. They came up with two chances and converted them,' he said.</p>
      <p>'We were hoping to maintain our winning run after getting maximum points last week. We need to be consistent and win two to three games but the fixture is a bit tight. Next week we face Highlanders in another derby.'</p>
      <p>Teams:</p>
      <p>Chicken Inn: D Bernard, M Jackson, X Ndlovu, L Chakoroma, S Ndlovu (Kadonzvo 75 mins), P Bernard, T Chipunza, I Mucheneka, O Chirinda, C Augusto, M Gaki ( Matawu 46 mins)</p>
      <p>Bulawayo Chiefs: L Chirava, B Mpofu, P Sibanda, S Dube, M Mkolo, L Ndlela, A Musiyiwa, S Nyahwa (K Chakanyuka 86 mins), D Shumbanhete (Bhebhe 77 mins), F Darkapata ( Zvakavapano 67 mins) F Matawu</p>

      <title>Land reform: The work that lies ahead</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Edmore Ndudzo</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding some of its shortcomings, which can definitely be corrected, the land reform has resolved a sensitive socio-political question in Zimbabwe, which the liberation struggle sought to remedy.</p>
      <p>On July 24 this year, The Herald reported that 'the 2018 flue-cured tobacco deliveries have reached a record 238 million kg', the highest ever figure recorded in the country's history.</p>
      <p>The previous record stood at 237 million kg achieved in 2000.</p>
      <p>Experts now expect overall tobacco deliveries to exceed 245 million kg after mop-up sales.</p>
      <p>This development undoubtedly marks a noteworthy milestone in the production of the golden leaf after the land reform programme.</p>
      <p>Relatedly, on July 9, 2015, The Herald reported new land rentals prescribed by Cabinet as follows: A1 farmers $15 per annum; A2 farmers $5 per hectare per annum; and Estates and plantations $10/ha per annum. A figure for wildlife conservancies was still to be agreed at the time of publishing.</p>
      <p>Usually, companies that own estates and plantations are issued with leases/permits that give them security of tenure allowing them to commit to long-term investments.</p>
      <p>It was envisaged that funds raised through these rentals - which were estimated at $22 million in the first year - would help finance periodic land audits, land surveys and other related operational costs.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, collections by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement have been disappointingly low, hovering around 25 percent, according to the Auditor-General.</p>
      <p>And this has been attributed to non-billing of farmers, laxity by officials and poor credit controls, among others.</p>
      <p>Even collections from A1 farmers, who are charged relatively less, have been disappointing.</p>
      <p>Government has since enacted the Finance Amendment Act of 2018, which effectively transfers the mandate to collect development levies from the Lands, Ministry to the Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Ministry.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that 300 000 households benefited from the land reform programme, and the waiting list stands at 500 000 households according to some claims.</p>
      <p>What is not deniable, however, is the fact that most pieces of land remain underutilised, derelict and fallow.</p>
      <p>Multi-farm ownership, double allocations and land disputes are also a real challenge.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding some of its shortcomings, which can definitely be corrected, the land reform has resolved a sensitive socio-political question in Zimbabwe, which the liberation struggle sought to remedy.</p>
      <p>Success</p>
      <p>There is no doubt there has been a considerable measure of success for the land reform programme, particularly in tobacco production.</p>
      <p>In the 2014/2015 marketing season, production was at 190 million kg, which was a drop from 216 million kg in the preceding season. In 2000 - its worst ever season after land reforms - production dropped to 50 million kg.</p>
      <p>Of late, output has been rising.</p>
      <p>I believe Zimbabwe has potential to produce 400 million kg per year, comparable to the more than 700 million kg produced by world leader Brazil.</p>
      <p>China, as a consumer and key financier in the sector, remains a big factor in local tobacco production.</p>
      <p>Clearly, China, which also produces tobacco of its own, prefers locally produced tobacco for blending purposes since it has a unique flavour, texture and quality.</p>
      <p>It is notable that China has over 300 million smokers - roughly the population of the US.</p>
      <p>Prices offered at tobacco auction floors have also been rising commendably, from $2,50 per kg before the land reform programme to the current $5 per kg.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, small-scale farmers, whose ranks continue to grow, now account for the bulk of deliveries.</p>
      <p>This ultimately demystifies the age-old view that tobacco production is a preserve of so-called 'sophisticated' white farmers.</p>
      <p>It is quite evident that small-scale farmers are now eclipsing the previous producers.</p>
      <p>Should we be able to value-add locally produced tobacco, the benefits to the economy will be immense.</p>
      <p>Maize</p>
      <p>A lot still needs to be done to increase maize production.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, the country used to be internationally reputed for producing the crop.</p>
      <p>The country, therefore, has to ensure that it reserves enough irrigable land to produce two million tonnes, at the very minimal, that will suffice for domestic consumption.</p>
      <p>Essentially, we need to ensure we produce enough for the strategic grain reserve - at 500 000 tonnes per season - and progressively build output to two million tonnes.</p>
      <p>In the 2016/2017 summer cropping season, things started looking up because of Command Agriculture.</p>
      <p>Already, we have over a million tonnes of grain in our silos and we are likely to end the marketing season with 1,5 million tonnes.</p>
      <p>The maize producer price of $390 per tonne - the highest in the region - is a worthy incentive for farmers.</p>
      <p>Cotton</p>
      <p>Cotton production is also rising after years of decline. Government's input support scheme, subsidies and upwardly adjusted producer prices are also helping in this regard.</p>
      <p>This has brought hope to an industry that was nearing collapse.</p>
      <p>So far, deliveries have reached 120 000 tonnes, exceeding this year's target by 20 percent, according to stats from Cottco.</p>
      <p>Encouragingly, cotton deliveries increased by 122 percent from last year and 1100 percent from 2015.</p>
      <p>At its peak, in 2013, Zimbabwe produced 352 000 tonnes.</p>
      <p>Over the past three years, Government has been giving free inputs to farmers through the Presidential Free Cotton Inputs Scheme, which was launched in 2015.</p>
      <p>At the time the programme was launched, production had plummeted to 28 000 tonnes, the lowest in two decades.</p>
      <p>As part of the inputs package, Government is issuing basal- and top-dressing fertiliser, seed and chemicals that are sufficient to cover one hectare.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that 400 000 hectare will therefore be put under production.</p>
      <p>Cotton production feeds into other key sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p>For example, apart from lint exports, the seed can also be used to manufacture edible oil, while by-products can be used to manufacture stockfeeds.</p>
      <p>Livestock</p>
      <p>Command Livestock, which is envisaged to rebuild the country's herd, is now in full swing.</p>
      <p>It encompasses piggery, poultry, goat and sheep rearing, wildlife, fisheries, bee-keeping, et cetera.</p>
      <p>Production of small grains in also trekking northwards.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the land redistribution exercise has given communal farmers - most of who were historically confined to unproductive land - an asset that can be leveraged to increase production.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe now needs to strategically reposition itself through increasing both production and productivity.</p>
      <p>First, there is need to cut farm sizes for both A1 and A2 farmers to create room for more farmers.</p>
      <p>And this can be done through Statutory Instrument 419 of 1999 and Statutory Instrument 288 of 2000.</p>
      <p>For A2 farms, the maximum farm size should not exceed 400 hectares in Mashonaland East, while Mashonaland Central the maximum size is 350 hectares.</p>
      <p>A1 farms should also not exceed 6 hectares.</p>
      <p>There however remains scope for further reduction in farm sizes.</p>
      <p>Sometime in the future, new demand for land is expected to be matched by land that will naturally be made available through the death of beneficiaries, repossessions for non-payment of debt and rentals, among other factors.</p>
      <p>Mechanisation</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that mechanisation of agriculture will help improve production.</p>
      <p>Overall, the average national yield per hectare stands at one tonne per hectare, while in others it has been more than 10 tonnes per hectare.</p>
      <p>The already prescribed land rentals are likely to help increase production through discouraging ownership that does not translate to production.</p>
      <p>It is a smart way of realigning land distribution.</p>
      <p>This is markedly different to the system that obtained before land reforms, where whites intractably refused to democratise land ownership in the 100 years before 1999.</p>
      <p>In the circumstances, the people of Zimbabwe had no option but to forcibly reclaim the land.</p>
      <p>Neighbouring South Africa is now grappling with the same delicate problem.</p>
      <p>Rationalising</p>
      <p>Happily, the land audit currently ongoing will assist in rationalising farm ownership and sizes in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Where additional land becomes available, new beneficiaries of land allocations from the waiting list should, in my view, be selected in the following order of priority and preference:</p>
      <p>(a) Youths, especially those with degrees/diplomas from agricultural institutions;</p>
      <p>(b) Women and war veterans, war collaborators, ex-detainees and restrictees with passion for agriculture;</p>
      <p>(c) Anyone with resources and the capacity to farm; and</p>
      <p>(d) Other interested applicants.</p>
      <p>Authorities should also give due regard to the amount of time a beneficiary has been on the waiting list.</p>
      <p>The SAP software system that is currently being used by Government can be modified and customised to ensure a foolproof and rational distribution of land.</p>
      <p>A manual system ultimately opens up the exercise to corruption.</p>
      <p>Legacy</p>
      <p>To ensure that the Land Reform Programme has a lasting legacy, Government needs to:</p>
      <p>(a) Put Government guarantees on all 99-year leases or special permits and offer letters. The same dispensation should also be extended to communal areas in order to unlock funding from financial institutions. Such an architecture also means that Government can foreclose the property in the event of failure by beneficiaries to service their debts;</p>
      <p>(b) Ensure the cost of finance is limited to 1 percent for working capital and below 1 percent for capital expenditure, which can only be recovered during harvesting and marketing. Current interest rates are untenable;</p>
      <p>(c) Continue subsidising inputs;</p>
      <p>(d) Create a far-reaching farm mechanisation, modernisation and irrigation programme;</p>
      <p>(e) Fund research and development in agriculture and ensuring the findings of the same are implemented timeously; and</p>
      <p>(f) Capacitate institutions like Agribank, Arda, AMA, GMB, and the Land Commission.</p>
      <p>There is need to continuously adjust and advance Command Agriculture. Also, there is need to mobilise funds from institutions like the Asia Investment Bank, the Brics New Development Bank, China Eximbank and Chinese Development Bank.</p>
      <p>Mr Edmore AM Ndudzo is a beneficiary of the Land Reform Programme. He was the first black treasurer of the City of Harare and a Land Commissioner of Zimbabwe; and was lead consultant in crafting of the Public Finance Management Act of 2009</p>
