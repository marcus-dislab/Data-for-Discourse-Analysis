      <title>Sex, scandal and soap opera: the Sun King on TV</title>
      <subtitle>cover story A lavish drama about Louis XIV and his decadent court is set to be an international blockbuster. Andrew Billen toured the set</subtitle>

    <text>
      <p>The scale of the impertinence strikes different people at different moments. For George Blagden, the 26-year-old English actor plucked from his monkish role on the History Channel's Vikings to play Louis XIV, it was on his way to his first day on the set of Versailles. He went to the loos at Charles de Gaulle airport and found the walls decorated with little Sun King heads. "I thought, OK, I am not just playing a historical figure here. I am playing a brand." Let us pause to consider the dimensions of this lÈse-majesté. Versailles is a French-Canadian Canal+ television drama about France's most famous monarch. It has been written by two Englishmen, stars another two Englishmen, features many more, and has been made in English because it is roughly ten times easier to sell a programme round the world if it is in our tongue, not theirs. Canal+'s own viewers? Let them read subtitles.</p>
      <p>It is not even a respectful, dignified historical drama, filled with beloved whitehaired character actors, fan-flapping extras and Mark Rylance. The cast is young, virtually unknown, and takes its clothes off all the time. It is Les Liaisons Dangereuses meets House of Cards for the Pretty Little Liars generation: suits with wigs. Its constants are power, the palace, paranoia and paramours. Its theme tune is an electronic rock symphony. It loves that Louis, like Steve Jobs, invented his own logo, the sun with two Ls. Assuredly, it is not national heritage TV.</p>
      <p>And the French are knocking it back like champagne. Now viewers in 136 countries, including ours, are getting the chance to share the amour, or as they would call it on Versailles, "love".</p>
      <p>To grasp the size of this thing, it takes a visit not to the Palace of Versailles, which is open to the crew for filming only on the one day a week it is closed to the public, but to the huge fun factory in east Paris where the interiors have been re-created, the costumes made, the wigs teased and the furniture handmade so as to alchemise wood into marble. Versailles occupies 1,000 sq m of Studio de Bry, a soundstage recently threatened with closure. It is French television's biggest set.</p>
      <p>I am shown round by Claude Chelli, an executive producer, whom I suggest is Versailles' own sun king - he insists he is no more than a shadow in the corridors of power, quietly fretting at the expense of it all (£22 million or so for ten episodes). He takes me to the king's chamber, where the barely postpubescent Louis uneasily sleeps, attended by Bontemps, his chief valet, who rests on a couch at the end of the royal four-poster.</p>
      <p>"He could," says Chelli, "be woken at any time. Remember when Louis has that bad dream at the beginning of episode one?" The royal dream is only bad in parts, beginning with his dying mother's warning that "terrible things happen to kings", but progressing to a premonition of the future glory of the palace - in 1667 still a rather un-humble hunting lodge - and climaxing with hot sex with a blonde nymph. Ever alert, Bontemps rushes to wipe away a sticky surfeit of enthusiasm from the royal loins.</p>
      <p>Versailles is actually ruled by the English diarchy of showrunners David Wolstencroft, who created Spooks, and Simon Mirren, Dame Helen's nephew, who has recently commanded the American police procedural Criminal Minds. Wolstencroft studied Louis XIV at Cambridge and consulted his old tutor, the cultural historian Peter Burke, about the project. He says, however, that when they took over the project from the ashes of a failed first attempt, it was Mirren who had a breakthrough insight.</p>
      <p>Knowing a thing or two about criminal minds, he was fascinated that Louis, after a long, impotent regency, chose, in his twenties, to relocate his court to his father's hunting lodge and then, rather than demolish it, build a palace around it. This struck him as casebook psychopathic.</p>
      <p>"Was he embracing his father or was he smothering him?" asks Wolstencroft rhetorically. "His father was Louis XIII.</p>
      <p>His son did not want to be a number."</p>
      <p>He was not a number. He was a free man, I join in, enthusiastically. "You are right," says Wolstencroft. "Louis is the Patrick McGoohan of 17th-century France." If the cult Sixties drama The Prisoner was an exercise in paranoia, this is its match. The ever-expanding palace, is, in TV terms, a precinct in which an ensemble interacts, but it is also an extrapolation of the king's state of mind. As Wolstencroft puts it a little extravagantly, in striving to create the first European "superstate", Louis needed to invent a Stasi to protect it. The absorbing ambition of an absolute monarch, who has survived a rebellion in his youth, is to hold on to power, even as he is assailed by the Dutch, the Spanish, his jealous gay brother, his recalcitrant and unreliable queen and his excitable libido, which is used as a weapon against him by the women of the court and their backers.</p>
      <p>To summarise: King Louis is sleeping with his younger brother Philippe's English wife, Henrietta, Charles II of England's sister. In series one alone, some half dozen other women also grace his bed, including the notorious Madame de Montespan, the inventor of a garment that could be undone by a lover with one hand. Brother Philippe, a cross-dresser, is in well-reciprocated love with the dashing nobleman Chevalier de Lorraine. When we join the story, Louis' queen, Maria Theresa of Spain, is about to give birth to a daughter. Without weakening the first episode's punchline - the child is most unlikely to have been his.</p>
      <p>Did that scandal actually happen? "No one is saying it www.happened.No one is saying it didn't happen. I see this series as the iceberg under the surface, and it is a plausible iceberg," Wolstencroft says.</p>
      <p>Back on my studio promenade, we enter the misty region - water vapour is generated to dampen the harshness of ultra-high-definition television - of the queen's antechamber. Blagden, as the king, stomps down the corridor to accuse her of being in love with a priest (season two, which is being filmed, is much concerned with church and state). Au contraire, Father Pascal is the purest man she knows. "You are putting me through hell!" she screams at the pot who is calling her kettle.</p>
      <p>"The flames may do wonders for the ice round your heart," ripostes Louis.</p>
      <p>Elisa Lasowski - a prostitute in series three of Game of Thrones and now Louis' queen - is delighted that I saw this moment of payback. "She's never exploded with the king before."</p>
      <p>Are they in love? "She truly loves him. He has a high respect for her because she was royalty but that didn't mean he respected her as a woman. As a partner in running the country, he was faithful. In their intimate life, he was something else."</p>
      <p>Lasowski is equally indignant at the way historians traditionally dismissed Maria Theresa. "They were more interested in Louis' mistresses. She was cast aside as a boring queen who spoke only in her chambers with her ladies-in-waiting and her black dwarfs."</p>
      <p>Lasowski's portrayal, however, has made such an impact in France, where the show aired in the autumn, that her part has been expanded. The humiliation of Maria Theresa by Louis and historians might prompt us to check, however, whether the young actresses who here show so much flesh to so many are not being a little exploited themselves.</p>
      <p>There are a few things to be said about this before we join other arrondissements of the British press in condemning Versailles as "primetime porn". For one thing, this is France, where television nudity is commonplace. For another, as Lasowski points out, the disinhibitions of the 17thcentury French court chime conveniently with the licence that cable and the internet have granted American drama. For a third, the BBC's head of acquisitions, Sue Deeks, promises (if that is the verb) that "there is nothing in Versailles that an adult audience that watches drama on British television hasn't seen before".</p>
      <p>Wolstencroft insists that the sex, like the even more graphic violence, is "integral to the piece". "Every moment of shock is there for a reason and is something Lady Antonia Fraser might back up as true. We have become inured to it through our cultural inheritance. The past seems a very clean, polite place and it wasn't at all. The muscle and spirit of the show comes from that honesty."</p>
      <p>"I had," says Blagden, "an amazing conversation with the series' adviser Mathieu da Vinha after he had read the first five hours of season one. I privately asked him, 'Are we going a bit far with this?' And he said. 'Oh God, you don't know the half of it!' That relaxed me.</p>
      <p>"It was the same when I asked the producers if this was all necessary. Within 30 seconds I felt like an idiot. There was no way we could do this show without including that element, because so often political figures in that world moved up and down the ladder through sexual politics. Sex was almost like board meetings."</p>
      <p>So let us allow Versailles its liberté. What about egalité between the sexes? I assume George has not shown his penis to the lens. "It is interesting. I did. I am still waiting to find out whether this will be allowed on the BBC. It was in France."</p>
      <p>The sad news for Blagden, and his fans, is that both Wolstencroft and Chelli are adamant that George's verge did not make it even as far as Canal+ viewers. In fact, the first sex scene we witness is between two men, Louis' brother, Philippe, and his lover. "The truest love in the whole show is between Philippe and Chevalier," says Alexander Vlahos (Mordred from Merlin) who plays Philippe, the transvestite warrior and his brother's dangerously candid friend.</p>
      <p>"For an audience, he makes the show incredibly modern. You could imagine someone like him in our time, right now. In Britain we are incredibly conservative. I think we are a little bit behind other people's world-views. The French have always been at the head of accepting people like this."</p>
      <p>Neither Blagden nor Vlahos have brothers in real life. Now, however, they text each other as "Brother". Mind you, says Blagden, Versailles has made him very glad his only sibling is a sister.</p>
      <p>"Here," says Wolstencroft, "is a very young king with a lot on his shoulders and a brother who has been put under the shadow since he was four years old and dressed as a woman, effeminised and emasculated in some way by his mother. It quickly became a show about brothers and the woman who comes between them, Henrietta. We have a dysfunctional family at the centre of an extraordinary precinct."</p>
      <p>What, however, of Britain's fraternal relations with France, now that we have come over and kidnapped their most famous king? Surely, I ask Chelli, this was sacrilege. The French must love their Sun King too much to have him played by a bloke named George.</p>
      <p>"Of course, every French person is proud of Louis. He invented the whole thing. He invented ballet. He invented music really, that kind of music, food, very famous cooks. He invented the political system, but the system was close to fascism. He opened every letter. He had spies everywhere. He demanded absolute power. Everybody in the world knows Versailles, so the French are very proud of that, but we know he spent his life making wars."</p>
      <p>And love, naturellement. It is time for lunch, and because this is France and there are rules and laws about such things, le déjeuner is a 90-minute sit-down affair with steak and red wine and cheese and a dog yapping somewhere under a table. Whichever way Brexit goes, Blagden and his gang of cheeky British thesps will always remember the days they took Versailles for all it was worth.</p>
      <p>Versailles starts on BBC Two at 9.30pm, Wednesday, June 1</p>

      <author>David Byers; Body; Should you buy a fixer-upper property that needs hundreds of thousands of pounds' worth of work in a jittery housing market where you might find it harder to sell on? Jay Badiani, 34, and his wife, Alice, 28, had no hesitation - and have no regrets.; In 2016 the couple bought a dilapidated but spacious one-bedroom garden flat for £605,000 in Hammersmith, west London, then gutted and refurbished it. Despite transaction levels in that area plummeting 17 per cent in the three years since George Osborne raised stamp-duty levels when he was chancellor, they sold it swiftly and made a profit.; Before Jay and Alice succeeded in their mission because they had a clear and costed plan. Out went the rotting yellow wallpaper and outdated appliances in the 1970s bathroom, and in came luxurious marble surfaces and a power shower. Next, the rotting mustard wallpaper and decades-old carpet in communal areas were stripped away to be replaced with white paint and new floor coverings. A new kitchen was installed, a further bedroom and bathroom were added, the scruffy 60ft garden was landscaped and an outhouse built. The total for the work was a steep £250,000, but the couple's gamble paid off. They sold it last year for £1.05 million - a profit of about £200,000. "It's not for everybody," says Jay, who is refurbishing another property in nearby Ladbroke Grove with his wife.; "It requires a certain bravery and you need to have time and a clear plan. But we have gained great satisfaction doing it, and we've made money too."; For Jay and Alice, buying a fixer-upper had a dual purpose - it made them money, but it also gave them a foothold in an area where they could otherwise not have afforded to live. This is a key driver for many people who buy a home that requires work.; So what should you think about when considering such a property, either to live in or sell on? Here are our expert tips.; Location is crucial Finding the right home for renovation doesn't start with the structure or condition of the property, says Lucy Crane, a senior negotiator at Strutt &amp; Parker estate agency in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. It starts with where you buy. "As with all good property purchases, whether it's a holiday home, buy-to-let or investment property, location is king. It pays to know the area, from staying up to date with local house prices to knowing of any new developments. This can help to make sure you pay the right price for your project," she says. For the biggest profit choose an area where the property market is relatively vibrant and prices are rising. However, if like Jay and Alice you're after a fixer-upper in a fashionable location, you'll have to budget carefully. One outmoded four-bedroom house in Fulham, southwest London, that hasn't been sold since it was built in 1887 and has just gone on the market, requires "complete transformation", says Hamptons International, the agency handling its sale. If you can stomach the project, you'll be able to buy it for £1.45 million - about half the price of a similarly sized home that has been modernised.; Joanna Cocking, the head of prime and country houses at Hamptons, says that your estate agent should tell you whether a property will make you money. "Any good agent should be able to advise on the completed value, if the works are undertaken," she says.; Do your maths carefully If you're renovating with an eye to adding value, look at the price ceiling for the area. A £250,000 property that needs £200,000 of work might seem like a bargain, but if the most a property has sold for in that postcode is £400,000, you could struggle to break even when you come to sell.; One of the biggest hazards is buyers vastly underestimating the cost of renovation. "With cosmetic projects, extensions or rebuilds, buyers typically underestimate the cost and amount of time projects are going to absorb," says Harry Gladwin of the Buying Solution, a buying agency. "They also fail to put the right team in place and get the best advice at the outset, meaning that they can be exposed to unforeseen risk farther down the line. We frequently see the six-month project which is in its third year, with no end in sight."; Think about factors that could add to the price and make it a less attractive investment. "An old cottage in the middle of the countryside might look ideal, but if you can't get large vehicles up to it, or there's no plumber for 100 miles, the cost of your renovation could rapidly rise," Crane says.; Think about interiors Richard Angel, a co-founder of the interior design company Angel O'Donnell, says that you should always prioritise the unsexy stuff - plumbing, electrics and good-quality plastering over any home decor - because these will cost you a huge amount later if you fail to do them properly.; You don't need to spend a fortune on decor to be stylish. He suggests buying a "low-cost kitchen carcass" initially, which you then upgrade with a bespoke worktop, fitted cupboards and expensive handles. "These are sure-fire ways of creating maximum impact at minimum cost," he says.; En suite bathrooms add value to any refurbishment, increasing the value of a property by as much as 5 per cent, according to Belinda Hutchinson-Smith, the director at Strutt &amp; Parker in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.; Avoid vast structural projects That empty farm building and derelict mansion may seem full of potential, but the reality probably is that no one has touched them because they have serious structural issues. To ensure you're not being hoodwinked, take a builder and experienced surveyor to a viewing. Structural problems, such as rotting timber or faulty foundations and subsidence, will bring any renovation project to a halt.; "Take care when buying any home that has been abandoned or derelict for many years. If roof tiles have come off, then water could have seeped into everything, undermining its structural integrity, especially in older buildings that have timber frames," Crane says.; "Movement cracks are common in older homes, so shouldn't instantly put you off. But if you can fit your finger into a crack, it's worth getting it checked, as it could be a sign of subsidence."; Watch out for asbestos, rewiring and plumbing issues - and avoid homes in conservation areas or national parks. Planning restrictions in these areas will limit the work you can do.; Don't forget the garden A well-landscaped garden can add up to 10 per cent to the value of your home and make it much more attractive to buyers, Hutchinson-Smith says.; She suggests colourful beds; a flat grassed area that will appeal to families and is easy to maintain; a wall, fence or lined trees to protect privacy; and good garden lighting, especially on terraces and pathways.; Where to find inspiration ? www.Houzz.co.uk An online home renovation and design platform that claims to have 1.5 million photos to browse; plus you can find builders and shop for products. ? www.Remodelista.com An American ideas and advice website, with products for creating a beautiful home. ? www.Printpattern.blogspot.com This blog is full of print and pattern ideas - perfect if you're planning new wallpaper, curtains or upholstery.; ?

      <title>The invisible star</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>She's the artist critics love to hate, and you won't catch her on a red carpet. Yet Enya has sold a staggering 65 million albums - and counting</p>
      <p>We had hoped to meet Enya at her castle, but a fortnight earlier a stalker had broken in and subjected her to a shattering ordeal, tying up a maid while the reclusive singer hid in a locked room. She hit the panic button installed for just such moments and waited two terrifying hours for the police to arrive while her assailant prowled the corridors of her home. In the same week, a second stalker was arrested in the grounds, so the castle, in the exclusive south Dublin enclave of Killiney, where her neighbours include members of U2, is off-limits while a security review is conducted.</p>
      <p>So what to do? Obvious, really. You borrow someone else's castle for the day. And so we meet at the nearby Killruddery House, a 17th-century pile built by the Meath family, replete with family portraits, vaulted ceilings, Italian statuary, an orangery and formal gardens in the French style, famed as the finest in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Enya has a thing about castles; while writing this piece, we arranged a second meeting. This time she nominated the even grander surroundings of Chateau de Vaux le Vicomte, a monument to the opulence of Louis XIV's court located an hour's drive south of Paris and a perfect fairytale setting for the launch party for her new album, Amarantine. You have to sell a lot of records to afford that kind of castle-hopping, and Enya has sold an awful lot of records. Some 65 million to be exact, 13 million of them for her last album Day Without Rain, released in 2000. And she wasn't going to allow a stalker to delay her new album from adding further to that impressive sales tally, for when I offer my sympathies, she shrugs and says she was back at work in the studio the next day. "You deal with it and you move on," she says with a disconcerting matter-of-factness. "Those things happen and for that moment it's not nice. But you have to put it behind you."</p>
      <p>Tiny and fragile-looking she may be, but there's hidden steel in Eithne N! Bhraon in (to use Enya's Irish name), for many stars would have cancelled all engagements, booked themselves in for post-traumatic therapy and gone into hiding - particularly when the intruder is still out there somewhere.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time, either, such rude intrusions have happened in Enya's world. She was once stalked for a year by an Italian fan who walked around Dublin with a framed picture of her hanging from his neck, sent her love letters and eventually stabbed himself after being thrown out of her parents' pub in Donegal.</p>
      <p>Quite why she should attract such obsessive attention is something of a mystery. Enya has to be the world's most invisible star. Shy to the point of secretiveness, you never read about her in the gossip columns. She has never played a live concert and she seldom even seems to go out. When she made a rare excursion into the spotlight at the Oscars three years ago, she was delighted to meet Sir Paul McCartney - but it was the former Beatle who approached her. "Enya would never have dreamt of going up to him," says Nicky Ryan, who co-manages her with his wife, Roma. "She doesn't bother with any of that celebrity stuff and avoids it like the plague. She's very low-profile."</p>
      <p>Enya lives alone in her castle, and although it is said there have been occasional boyfriends, she has never been seen with them in public and names have not been divulged. In 1998 she was believed to be stepping out with an anonymous Spanish beau but Irish tabloids soon reported they had split up. When asked if there is a current man in her life, she feigns surprise that anybody should be interested. For the record, it appears that there is not. She says her "best friends" are her managers, Nicky and Roma Ryan, a generation older and with whom she lived for several years when she was struggling to get established. It caused a rift when she left the family group - the folk band, Clannad - to embark on a solo career under their guidance. But that has long been healed, and she spends Christmases and other holidays with them in Donegal. She also regularly visits a sister in Australia. Ask her how she relaxes and she will tell you that she enjoys watching black-and-white films and walking (preferably alone), but doesn't take holidays.</p>
      <p>Her born-to-be-mild private persona is reflected in her soothing, quasi-classical melodies and ethereal vocals. On the surface, it's hardly the stuff to stir deep, uncontrollable passions, and if you wanted to be unkind you might even call her music anodyne. Yet it clearly fulfils a deep need among her fans as an oasis of calm and comfort in a world of clamour, chaos and confusion. It was no coincidence that in the wake of 9/11, Only Time, a piece of music from her last album, became the balm that soothed America's wounds, adopted one by one by the major US networks as a soundtrack of healing whenever those horrific pictures of Ground Zero were shown.</p>
      <p>Perching demurely on the edge of an over-stuffed sofa in the Neo-Classical drawing room of Killruddery House and dressed in a bright-red jacket and sensible skirt, Enya looks more like a modern-day headmistress than a pop star. If you didn't know she was 43 years old, you'd be hard pressed to guess her age at all. Everything about her seems to be carefully calculated not to offend, and rock critics, who appear to loathe her music with a rare passion, would probably say the same about her music. Hence her record company has not even bothered sending the album out for review. Her fans are so loyal to the brand, they reason, all they need to do is advertise the record to let them know that it's out. That she has enjoyed such success without critical support, without touring and without playing the celebrity game makes her a musical phenomenon.</p>
      <p>"I could have been more famous if I did all the glitzy things, but celebrity always seemed so unnecessary," she says. "Fame and success are very different things, anyway. The music sold itself before anybody knew who I was, so I felt I had a choice. I told the record company I didn't feel the need to be out there at red-carpet events. I wanted a career. But I wanted to keep myself intact as a person."</p>
      <p>Born into a famous Irish folk family in Gweedore, County Donegal, Enya was the youngest of nine children, and in 1980 followed several of her brothers and sisters into Clannad. She stayed for two years, but always felt that she was being treated as the kid sister. "It was fun but I had no musical input," she recalls. "My brothers were doing the writing and arranging, so it felt temporary."</p>
      <p>At the time Clannad were managed by Ryan, a veteran of the Irish music scene, and when the band dispensed with his services in 1982, he suggested to Enya that she might try her luck as a solo artist. She left the family behind amid considerable acrimony and went to live with him, Roma and their two young daughters in Dublin. "It was obvious she had real talent as a composer and she also had a beautiful voice, but she wasn't getting any space within the group," Ryan says today. "It was a leap of faith and trust on her part to come with us."</p>
      <p>Pooling their resources, they built their own recording studio in a shed in the Ryans' back garden. The bank wouldn't give them a loan, so Enya sold her saxophone and Nicky and Roma cashed in their life savings. Once they had the studio up and running, it was let out to other artists to cover the running costs, with Enya recording in whatever down time was left. The first hint that their mutual leap of faith might pay off came when she was invited to compose music for the soundtrack to the 1984 movie The Frog Prince. It was followed by a commission to provide the music for the 1986 TV documentary The Celts, the soundtrack for which became her first solo album, 1987's self-titled Enya.</p>
      <p>Yet although it was her name and face on the cover, the music was the creation of three people. "I started writing instrumentals but Roma pointed out they were very visual, so she started writing lyrics," Enya explains.</p>
      <p>"And Nicky had this idea of creating a wall of sound and started multi-tracking my voice."</p>
      <p>Her first release attracted little attention, but one of the few who did take notice was Rob Dickens, then chairman of Warner Music, who signed her to the label, despite little obvious sales potential. "I do remember people saying to me, 'Your music's not very commercial. How are you going to sell that?'" Enya admits today. Dickens was equally unsure if he could sell her and famously observed at the time: "Sometimes the company is there to make money, and sometimes it's there to make music. Enya's the latter."</p>
      <p>Confounding all predictions, Watermark, her 1988 debut for Warner's, sold nine million copies to make her Ireland's best-selling solo artist, and spawned the chart-topping single Orinoco Flow. "I didn't expect such a huge reaction, but I knew I was doing something different to everything else that was happening at the time," she recalls. "People feel a very personal connection with the music."</p>
      <p>Her music was swiftly dubbed New Age, but she dismisses the label as "a marketing term". She's happier that her music has spawned an adjective of its own - "Enya-esque". "That's a huge compliment because it means you've something in which you were the first."</p>
      <p>Her fans have remained devoted to her work ever since her initial success, and subsequent albums such as Shepherd Moons, The Memory of Trees and A Day Without Rain have all done similar or better business. Then in 2001, two of her songs were used in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, resulting in an Oscar nomination.</p>
      <p>Her new album, Amarantine, was finished the night before we meet, and she confesses the reason it has taken so long is because she's utterly obsessive once she gets in the studio. "There might be one little thing that makes all the difference, one note or one word. The fine-tuning is all important, and you've got to stay there until you get it right," she insists. "That's why it can take years."</p>
      <p>Her workaholic existence finds her writing at the piano from ten till six, and holidays are not on the agenda. "We're not people who know how to take holidays," she observes. "We literally wouldn't know how to go about booking one." She does, however, take care to separate work and home. Her castle, which she insists is a "small" one, has a music room, but it's purely for "social use".</p>
      <p>Enya fell in love with Manderley Castle, built in the 1840s, the minute she saw it and bought it nine years ago for £ 2.5 million. "It was in terrible condition, but I've made it very homely," she says.</p>
      <p>When it comes to children, she notes that she has plenty of nieces and nephews, and she's also a surrogate aunt to the Ryans' two daughters, Ebony and Persia, now grown up. The couple are a decade and more older than Enya, and over the years have been variously accused of manipulating her and keeping her from the real world. It's clear that she relies on them heavily, but having seen her steely resolve over her stalkers, it's hard to imagine her being anyone's puppet. "It's a huge thing to have someone like that who believes in you from day one," is all she will say on the relationship, and when they come up in our conversation she refers to them not as her management team but as "my friends".</p>
      <p>In the past, Enya has sung in Gaelic and Latin as well as English, and on the new album, she sings three songs in an entirely invented language called Loxian. The idea came to Enya and her lyricist after she had sung in Elvish for The Lord of the Rings. "We've always concentrated on the sound of the words so that they enhance the melody. Sometimes a song just doesn't sound right in a particular language," she explains. Yet Loxian is not just an imaginary language, for Roma has constructed an elaborate Tolkienesque history of its people to accompany the songs. The sound of the Loxians, she writes in the album sleeve, "awakens in the hearts of all the Valley-dwellers a longing that brings them to the edge of tears, because it is the song of both the beginning and the end".</p>
      <p>Out with the leprechauns? Perhaps. Except that while indulging such flights of fantasy, the Ryans are also very sharp business operators who have guided Enya's career with enviable skill, and built her into an internationally recognisable brand. The Irish papers recently estimated the singer's wealth at £ 100 million when reporting the break-in to her castle, and the deal her team have negotiated with Warners gives the three of them unprecedented control over every aspect of the making and selling of her music.</p>
      <p>When we meet again at Chateau Vaux Le Vicomte a couple of weeks later, Warner executives are swarming everywhere and are clearly eager to please their star turn. Just before she arrives, a record company employee ushers everyone into the entrance hall to form a greeting party. When she makes her entrance, she's wearing a dramatic backless red gown, and she works the room expertly.</p>
      <p>Before we sit down to a banquet there's a spectacular firework display that ends with Enya's name picked out in flames. She smiles politely and poses for pictures, but you can't help thinking that she looks like the only person in such spectacular surroundings who wishes she were somewhere else.</p>
      <p>At the end of the evening, she's the first to leave. Then again, most of us don't have a castle to go home to.</p>

      <title>Can the new gladiator at the Coliseum save the ENO?</title>
      <subtitle>Mark Wigglesworth has been appointed the next music director of English National Opera. In an exclusive interview Richard Morrison hears his battle plans</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Among English National Opera insiders, rumours that "something's up" had been circulating for weeks. Yesterday they were confirmed. Edward Gardner, ENO's popular young music director, will leave at the end of next season after eight years. He will be succeeded by Mark Wigglesworth, also English, but at 49 a decade older than Gardner and, despite his pixie-like appearance, a conductor with a reputation for steely, even abrasive determination.</p>
      <p>He will need that. ENO is going through tough times. Gardner's impassioned conducting of operas ranging from Peter Grimes and Wozzeck to The Damnation of Faust has been exemplary, but many Coliseum regulars are dismayed by the number of stagings getting lambasted by the critics. The company's finances are precarious, with the management battling to overturn last season's £800,000 deficit in the face of subsidy cuts. And no replacement has yet been announced to succeed the chief executive, Loretta Tomasi, who bowed out last year. This ship needs more than a steady hand on the tiller.</p>
      <p>I met Wigglesworth last week in Maastricht where he was guestconducting.</p>
      <p>The previous evening he had checked in to an elegant old hotel, only to be told that it had just gone bankrupt. It's lucky that I'm not one of those pretentious stage directors whom ENO is fond of engaging: the temptation to make a deeply symbolic comparison with his new job would be hard to resist.</p>
      <p>Wigglesworth, however, is admirably bullish about the post that he will take up in autumn 2015. For one thing he is a fervent admirer of ENO's opera-in-English policy. "It allows the singers to convey far more nuanced interpretations," he says. For another, his links with the company go back a long way. "Especially if you count my time as an usher, when I was a student," he says. "It meant I saw everything the company did in the 1980s, usually more than once. I came to realise, because I ushered on every level, that the ENO audience is unique: passionate, diverse, curious and intensely loyal from stalls to balcony. In fact the balcony was the most loyal audience of all. That creates a special atmosphere to which performers certainly respond."</p>
      <p>Loyal or not, Coli punters had their patience sorely tested last autumn by unredeemably dreadful productions of Die Fledermaus and Fidelio in quick succession. Indeed, if one believes the rumours circulating before Christmas, it was conducting the latter - and finding his singers unable to hear the band because they were clambering over a climbing-frame behind plastic screens - that pushed Gardner over the edge. One isn't surprised that yesterday's announcement speaks of his "desire to focus more on symphonic repertoire in future" (he becomes chief conductor of the Bergen Philharmonic in 2015).</p>
      <p>"Fidelio is difficult; I don't think Beethoven was comfortable in the theatre," Wigglesworth replies carefully, when I ask him if he also intends to conduct the opera. Fair enough, but what about the general principle of the music director having a say in what happens on stage? Will Wigglesworth be a "hands on" music director, a latter-day Georg Solti? "The first half of that description is right," he laughs. "Mind you, 'hands on' suggests influence that is perhaps unhealthy. ENO is a collegiate place. That is one of its main strengths - a place where friends come together to work on projects. Collaboration is crucial and as I've got older I think I've got better at that. As a young conductor I found it difficult to know where my responsibilities ended and someone else's started. I also know the individuals at the Coliseum so well from the conducting I've done there. Even the stage manager I've known for 15 years."</p>
      <p>So would he, for instance, expect to be involved in choosing which directors stage the operas, even for productions he isn't conducting? There is a suitably Wagnerian luftpause. "I'm hesitating because I don't know," he admits. "But I intend to be part of every conversation whether I'm conducting or not. John Berry [ENO's artistic director] and I have known each other for a long time and I wouldn't have accepted this job if I didn't respect him."</p>
      <p>Does that mean, though, that Wigglesworth would intervene if he thought the musical values of a show in which he wasn't involved were being compromised by a directorial concept? "I think that, perversely, the productions I'm not conducting myself I would feel even more concerned about in the planning stage," he says. "But I don't see my role as protecting the music. I see it as delivering opera, which is music and drama in equal measure. And I will always defend ENO's right to take a risk."</p>
      <p>Isn't it because conductors around the world don't involve themselves early enough in the planning and rehearsals of operas that there are so many lamentable mismatches between stage and pit? "I can tell you from personal experience that sometimes the conductor is the last person to be booked," Wigglesworth replies. "You want to say: 'Look, if you want the music to be an intrinsic part of the process, get the conductor in earlier.' But I'm conducting a new production next season at Covent Garden - I can't say what it is - and from the first discussions I have been totally part of everything: direction, designs, casting. That's as it should be."</p>
      <p>Wigglesworth has been living out of a suitcase for more than a decade. Though Sussex born and educated at Manchester University and the Royal Academy of Music, he hasn't held a permanent conducting job in the UK since leaving the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in 2000. In 2008 his appointment as music director of La Monnaie opera in Brussels was aborted before it started, reputedly after a rebellion by the orchestra. I ask him whether he thinks his reputation for being tough on orchestras is unfair. "It's not for me to say whether reputations are unfair or not," he replies. "I've never been very good at faking my feelings, but everybody likes to think of themselves as being more rounded than their reputation."</p>
      <p>What he has done, however, is gain huge experience by guest-conducting many opera companies (including all the major British ones) and most of the world's great orchestras. Has he totted up how many orchestras he has conducted? "An alarming number," he replies. "Close to three figures."</p>
      <p>Those guest engagements have included several productions at ENO itself, where his conducting of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth, Janacek's Katya Kabanova and Wagner's Parsifal won particular acclaim. An indication of what repertoire he will conduct at the Coliseum in the future? "I want to do pretty much everything," he exclaims. "I want to take some risks, get out of my comfort zone. I think people know my personality enough to realise I would love to do more Wagner and Janácek, but I would also love to look at some Handel, some Italian stuff."</p>
      <p>Even though Handel is usually entrusted to Baroque specialists? "Well, we've learnt so much from those specialists that I think we can now do it ourselves," he replies. "And I would also love to be involved, as a conductor, in nurturing a new opera from the start."</p>
      <p>Surely, though, such an admired conductor of Wagner must have his sights set on one big, four-opera epic? Wigglesworth's eyes glint. "I wouldn't believe a conductor who said he didn't want to do The Ring," he acknowledges. "But ENO will do it when it feels it can cast it, with English singers and with the right director. Whenever it happens I will look forward to it more than anything in my life. But it may never happen."</p>
      <p>His wife is a former violinist, now doing a PhD at UCL in archaeology ("Early spear technology," her husband says, with a suitably proud look). They have a three-year-old daughter, and there's no doubt that Wigglesworth will relish spending more time in their house near the sea in Sussex. "I've been travelling eight months a year for a long time now, and although that's exciting in a superficial sense, I do feel a bit like a butterfly that never really creates anything."</p>
      <p>So what will be his commitment to ENO? "Total," he exclaims. "One of the reasons I feel I'm ready for the job is that I'm ready to make that total commitment. Every day. Full time."</p>

      <title>Why the cox is the mother hen</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Garry Herbert, the BBC's rowing commentator and former Olympic cox, reveals why 'just sitting there' can make a boat go even faster</p>
      <p>Soon after we won gold on a Spanish lake in the 1992 Olympics, an eminent sports writer described me as a "Conductor of Champions", which is an apt enough way to describe what a coxswain does and the importance of the role.</p>
      <p>For many, the cox's role has never been properly explained and remains somewhat of a contradiction in terms. "You sit there and yet contribute to the speed of the boat. How so?" - "Application my dear boy, application," an old boy wearing flannels half way up his shins and pink socks once told me.</p>
      <p>Rowing is among the most intricate and technical of sports, requiring an attention to detail hotly sought but rarely achieved. The pursuit of the perfect stroke, and hence speed, is the pursuit of the Holy Grail. The secret behind any team is teamwork, and the secret behind rowing teamwork is an inspirational cox.</p>
      <p>The eight is the "big boat" of rowing when it comes to establishing legends and reputations. In last year's Sydney Olympics the heroic victory of the men's eight (in some ways overshadowing the victory of the men's coxless four - Redgrave et al) was orchestrated in part by Rowley Douglas, their cox.</p>
      <p>The role of any successful cox begins not on the water with the individual crew, but on land with the squad as a whole. A cox is expected to be the coach's right-hand man in the gym and in training on the ergometers. While oarsmen batter their way through a heavy winter's training, a good cox will be dispensing words of support at the most critical of times - just like mother.</p>
      <p>A team is built not just on the water but through everyday experiences, and a cox's job is to compile those into some kind of motivational tool. For me, I knew, racing down lane three in the Olympic final, that we might never again have this chance, hence the words "if not now when, if not you, who?"</p>
      <p>But how to achieve that motivation? "Application my dear boy." Always to get the best out of them, coxes must know the strengths and weaknesses of the athletes they are working with.</p>
      <p>In addition, whether racing or training, a cox should be able to "feel" how the boat is travelling through the water, and must be able to relay this to his crew; the cox is the on-board coach, privileged to have the best seat in the house. The eyes of a hawk are needed to spot the smallest mistake, which may be tolerated for a single stroke but, after 50 strokes and some 500 metres, the impact will be clear.</p>
      <p>For coxes, the choice of words is critical. I, for one, have never uttered those infamous words "in, out, in, out"; indeed had I done so I would definitely have been out - for good. Nor have I advised my crew that "we're nearly there, I can see the finish line" when there were two miles of open water and three 90-degree bends between me and the line.</p>
      <p>Then what do we say? First, a cox will tell the crew what is happening around them, their position on the course and whether they lead or are being led and by how much. Everything a cox says must be delivered in a positive way. "Excellent start, still at 38 strokes, ready to settle, length in the water, time on the slide, speed on the catch, in three, in two, next stroke, now."</p>
      <p>A cox must never berate the crew but always be encouraging: relaxing commands to coax the rhythm, sharp commands if a sudden change of pace is required. "Rate on 36, half a length up, quick easy catches, pushing the feet away, moving out to a length, kill the race, ready, next stroke, go." For situations demanding an urgent response, carefully chosen expletives may make the winning difference.</p>
      <p>All in all, in a race, a cox is responsible for getting the crew off fast and then settling them into a rhythm. As custodian of the race plan, reading the race and anticipating its development is something very few can do. We have to be brave in the face of adversity: if the race calls for a change of tactics, so be it. Any decision is better than none.</p>
      <p>After months of intensive training, a cox will have forged a bond with his or her crew, forming a trust that enables them to tap into each athlete's psyche and know what words will have the effect of stimulating a better performance. Telling someone to "row faster" is like telling a runner to run faster: better to save your breath.</p>
      <p>On Saturday 16 men, having trained their hearts out for the past six months, will have only one thing left to do: their best for 4 1/4 miles. I know this is a simplification, but they can be no fitter or more versed in the stroke pattern they need to achieve. For the coxes...well, it's over to them; this is their day.</p>
      <p>Before a worldwide audience of millions, the Thames will test each cox's knowledge as they vie for the elusive stream, an ever-changing section of the river wide enough for just one boat. For this reason, if no other, coxes can win or lose a race. For some it is a time for cavalier tactics which, if successful, force one crew to steer out and away from the other despite the umpire warning the offenders. The battle is not just between the coxes but, for the braver ones, between them and the umpire. We have yet to see a crew in the main race be disqualified, but it could happen.</p>
      <p>The peculiarity of a race that makes, breaks or dents reputations is that even if no media were present - or any of the thousands of spectators who line the banks - two boats and 16 men would still turn up every year to contest a battle that is driven by the two small men or women who are also present and sit at the back of each boat to be conductors of their champions.</p>
      <p>The Boat Race is and remains a private race between two universities that we, as outsiders, have received a welcome invitation to share. If you are a real supporter of sport, you will know how true that is.</p>
      <p>Garry Herbert was the Olympic gold medal-winning cox at the 1992 Barcelona Games. He is BBC TV Sport's rowing commentator and a member of Grandstand's Boat Race presentation team.</p>

      <title>May is in a stronger position than you think</title>
      <subtitle>The Tories rediscovered unity and loyalty this week, which means that an orderly Brexit is now the likeliest outcome</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The Conservative Party has entered the first stage of what it hopes will be its recovery. On Tuesday night, in a series of votes in parliament, it bought unity at the price of fantasy. The party came together to demand that the prime minister return to Europe and shout even more loudly at the foreigners until they redraft the withdrawal agreement. It is a ridiculous posture but perhaps not as ridiculous as it seems. Most of the pundits confidently declared that this fantastic unity cannot last. Yet perhaps the significant event is not the fantasy but the unity.</p>
      <p>For the first time in an age, over last weekend and leading into Tuesday, we saw the stirrings of survival instinct. The Conservative Party's trade union leader, Sir Graham Brady, tabled an amendment that gained the backing of the May government. A junior minister, Kit Malthouse, managed to put Nicky Morgan in a room with Jacob Rees-Mogg long enough for them to emerge with an agreement. The two processes then merged and Sir Graham's amendment, which said nothing more useful than "can we all please have another try?", was passed. The Brady amendment was content-free, but so what? Look instead at the people involved. Something is afoot. The Tory party is seeking a deal. It may well prove impossible but the big story of the week is that it is about to try.</p>
      <p>A lot of print has been wasted on cataloguing the red lines Theresa May ought to have erased or the winnable items she never asked www.for.No doubt the negotiation could have been better but it is hard to envisage any plan that the EU27 were prepared to yield to that would satisfy the various demands of Conservative MPs and sail through the House of Commons. It is always tempting, because it is so vivid, to describe politics as a series of character defects. Mrs May is closed and weak, therefore her plan is the same. For the most part, though, politics is better understood as a struggle against inherited constraints. Mrs May is weak because she has inherited an impossible position. She has made mistakes but they are less important than we pretend.</p>
      <p>If Mrs May does the right things now, though, she might, just might, be able to get her deal through. The first act is to tread softly in her approach to the EU. The best way to end a political stalemate is to change the terms. Mrs May has been told that there is no appetite in the EU for reopening the withdrawal agreement. So start by making it plain that there is no desire to do so. It will, however, be necessary to have a separate mini-treaty in which Britain is given greater assurances that it will not be caught indefinitely in the backstop. If these can be adorned with some legal protocol, that would help a great deal too.</p>
      <p>Neither party to this negotiation, Britain nor the EU, remotely wants this country to leave without a deal. There is surely a way to do something, as long as we approach it diplomatically, which is to say exactly not in the fashion expected by the hardcore Brexit gang.</p>
      <p>On which point, here is Mrs May's second task. Let's remember the fundamental fact about this process, which can be obscured by too much detail. There are only three possible end-states: deal, no-deal or remain. Mrs May's strategic folly is that she has, in fact, not done enough to eliminate any of the options. Nobody has yet been forced to their Plan B. With the clock running down, that must now happen.</p>
      <p>Mrs May can help to pass her deal by calling in the most intransigent of the rebels and instructing them, calmly and with no sense of threat, in the political reality. There is no majority in parliament for leaving without a deal. The prime minister promised the House that it would have another opportunity to repeat the effect of the defeated Cooper-Boles amendment by which parliament would have taken greater control of the process. The non-binding Spelman-Dromey amendment showed beyond doubt that no-deal would not pass. She could go further and make it plain, in private conversations with the European Research Group, that she, Theresa May, is simply not going to lead Britain out of the EU on that basis. There is a forced choice here: between deal or delay leaving, perhaps, and remain.</p>
      <p>Finally, it could be that hard choices are dawning on even the most intransigent and unbiddable of zealots. If Mrs May can soften the blow but harden the choice her deal can succeed. The events of this week have certainly made that eventuality more likely. I have heard it said many times in recent days that we have been here before. The Tories vote for repealing the laws of gravity and hope that, this time, it will be different. But that is wrong; we haven't been here before. This is the first time that it has been February 1, 2019, which is a whole day nearer to the departure date. The gathering of the clan as time shortens means that, though it may look like a similar event, this time it could be different.</p>
      <p>The foreign secretary's suggestion that Brexit could be delayed for a short time, and the announcement by the leader of the House that the February recess has been cancelled are also signs that the government is clearing the decks to leave the EU.</p>
      <p>They might all be wrong - there are plenty of ways in which it can go wrong - but the Tories think we are leaving. It ought not to come as a surprise to the rest of the world if we do, but it probably will.</p>
      <p>Mrs May has signalled that she is prepared to blow up her own deal to secure a victory. This has caused wailing and gnashing among the pure in heart but, again, so what? She just wants to leave in an orderly fashion, with herself at the helm. It is humiliating, say her critics, to spend so long in negotiation for a deal which is then junked on a whim. Mrs May proves over and over, however, that humiliation is not something that simply happens to you. It is something you have to feel and she does not feel it.</p>
      <p>A consensus appears to be forming that no-deal Brexit is getting closer. That is true chronologically but in no other sense. The Tory party is trying to summon its ancient virtues of unity and loyalty. It may fail. The blood feuds are deep and some of their members might prefer the purity of self-sabotage. Yet cabinet ministers think the deal will pass. It won't be easy and it won't be a straight line but suddenly, in a range of options all of which are unlikely, that is now the most likely option.</p>
      <p>Signs are growing that the government is clearing the decks</p>
      <p>Neither May nor the EU want us to leave without a proper deal</p>
      <p>May won a significant victory within her own party on Tuesday night</p>

      <p>The argument appears to be gaining momentum. If Alex Salmond's White Paper makes the case for a referendum on independence, then why not endorse it? Surely it is better to lance the boil right away by asking the Scottish people to make a clear choice about their future than to allow another three years of what the Labour MEP David Martin calls "nationalism creep" to divert attention away from fundamental issues such as the economy and the state of the NHS. On the surface it seems a fair point. It was made bluntly at the weekend by Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, the former Scottish Secretary, who urged the Scottish Tories to call Salmond's bluff by forcing him to hold a referendum sooner rather than later. "Let's get it out of the way, then people will see that Emperor Salmond would have no clothes," he said.</p>
      <p>Martin makes much the same point today, though addressed, in his case, to his party colleagues. "I have no doubt that a Labour Party with a clear and articulate vision of Scotland's future would inflict a resounding defeat in the independence option and put the SNP administration on the back foot and possibly even in a terminal condition," he concludes.</p>
      <p>Both base their argument on the assumption that a referendum, with a clearly stated Yes or No option on Scottish independence, would be resoundingly defeated.</p>
      <p>Both believe that the sooner such a vote is held, the better for the Unionist cause. Both seem convinced that it would dispose of the independence issue for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Assumptions, however, are dangerous things, and in this case all three are questionable. If there is one thing we know about referendums it is that people make their decisions for all sorts of reasons, which may or may not relate directly to the question on the ballot paper. The defeat of the French referendum on the European constitution was as much a slap in the face for Jacques Chirac and his handling of the French economy as it was on the niceties of the future governance of Europe. The 1975 referendum that sealed Britain's membership of the EC was less about the merits of going into Europe than a statement on Britain's role in the world. And though the 1997 referendum on devolution was a clear cut decision about Scotland's future government, it could not have been won by so wide a margin unless it had been held, as it was, on the crest of Labour's electoral triumph.</p>
      <p>Handing the SNP the opportunity of staging a referendum on independence is, therefore, a high-risk strategy. Governments can influence the timing and wording of a referendum, as well as the political climate in which it is held, in ways that are hard to predict and even harder to control. With Salmond himself riding high in the polls, and Scottish Labour in disarray, it would take a brave pollster to predict the outcome of a referendum held any time soon.</p>
      <p>And is the case for Unionism as positive as it once was? Scots voters may not demonstrate much inclination to go independent, when asked about it in opinion polls, but there is no discernible wave of enthusiasm for the merits of the status quo either. Most want more powers given to the Parliament, and most, if offered the choice, would probably opt for something akin to fiscal independence -the ability of a Scottish Executive to raise and spend its own taxes. All three opposition parties have signed a statement saying that they want to seek more powers from Westminster. But so far there is little sign that the Prime Minister is minded to concede them.</p>
      <p>A referendum campaign might, therefore, be seen as a choice between one side offering strictly limited reform, and the other holding open a door invitingly labeled "change". Who is to say which alternative would be the more appealing?</p>
      <p>And finally, would a No vote dispose of the independence issue once and for all? Ask the people of Quebec. No independence party is ever going to surrender its flagship policy just because a single vote goes against it. The First Minister is nothing if not a shrewd operator. His response to a rejection from the electorate would doubtless be: "I hear what you say. I accept your verdict for the time being. But I reserve the right to come back to you again as soon as I judge the opportunity has improved."</p>
      <p>For all these reason, the opposition parties would be well-advised to hold their nerve and oppose a referendum. The best way of calling Alex Salmond's bluff is to challenge him to govern Scotland responsibly for the next four years. Then, the voters will be able to signal their verdict in the only referendum you can properly rely on -a General Election.</p>

      <p>AMERICAN SERVICEWOMEN ARE DYING IN RECORD NUMBERS IN IRAQ, AND MANY OF THE 14,000 SERVING THERE HAVE WON MEDALS FOR VALOUR. ALTHOUGH THEY ARE OUTRAGED BY THE HORRIFIC TORTURE OF IRAQI PRISONERS BY FEMALE COLLEAGUES, THEY FEEL THE STORM OBSCURES THEIR VITAL CONTRIBUTION IN THE CONFLICT. JOANNA WALTERS REPORTS</p>
      <p>AT THE EXACT moment that she was blown in the air by a booby-trap bomb in Baghdad, Sergeant Susan Sonnheim was fully conscious.</p>
      <p>"The thought that actually crossed my mind, 15ft in the air -I'm going to swear now, I hope that's OK -was 'those f***kers got me!' Then I landed," she says.</p>
      <p>She thought that she was just a bit mashed up as she lay there numb and bleeding.</p>
      <p>It turned out that she had been blinded in one eye and her face, throat, arms and legs were full of shrapnel. A deep hole in her Kevlar vest and a dented chewing-tobacco tin in a chest pocket were testimony to how close she came to buying it.</p>
      <p>She had spotted the bomb in a cardboard box at a road intersection during a night patrol with her US Military Police unit. Her injuries might not have been so bad if she had not taken a second to shout the warning "It's going to blow" to the four Iraqi police officers accompanying her, before she turned to run. They later sent word that she probably saved their lives.</p>
      <p>After she was shipped home to a military hospital in Washington, her fellow soldiers nicknamed any patrol they went on in search of explosive devices "Operation Sonnheim".</p>
      <p>"I'm quite proud of that," she says.</p>
      <p>Sonnheim became the first woman from Wisconsin to be awarded the Purple Heart medal for being wounded in combat.</p>
      <p>Even though US military women are officially not allowed into combat, they are finding themselves in the thick of the action in a conflict with no definable front line -and they are fighting and dying in record numbers.</p>
      <p>So far, 12 American servicewomen have died under hostile fire in Iraq, compared with four during the 1991 Gulf War. Another six have been killed outside of hostile fire and more than 100 wounded.</p>
      <p>Many, like 45-year-old Sonnheim, are angry about the damage done to their cause by other women soldiers such as Lynndie England, pictures of whom apparently abusing Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad are at the centre of the current storm.</p>
      <p>"It is more shocking to see women involved in the abuse, losing their humanity," she says. "You do not go there to treat prisoners like that. We are there to set an example. They failed.</p>
      <p>"I saved four Iraqi police, because they are human beings. I believe that they (the soldiers accused) lost their humanity, because if you are given an order you feel is unjust you have a right to question it. They know better. I think they just lost it. They were under stress working in that prison and had nothing better to do.</p>
      <p>Her words were echoed by Specialist Shoshana Johnson, who last year spent 22 days in an Iraqi jail after becoming the first African American woman to be taken as a prisoner of war.</p>
      <p>Johnson told ABC's Good Morning America: "It's deplorable. As American soldiers we are not trained like that. We are more of a country of the giving nature. I was treated very humanely.</p>
      <p>"As a female (soldier) you tend to prove yourself a little bit tougher, but I was always the kind of person who stood my own ground, no matter what the guys were doing. I was tough enough to tell them 'No'."</p>
      <p>Some 14,000 US women in uniform are deployed in Iraq, and 60,000 have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. A total of 40,000 served in the first Gulf War, which was at the time considered a watershed, involving as it did the largest number of US women yet deployed "to a combat theatre", says retired Navy captain Lory Manning, of the Centre for Women in Uniform think-tank in Washington.</p>
      <p>About 7,000 women, mostly nurses, served in Vietnam, and almost half a million American women served in the Second World War, but they were in non-combat roles.</p>
      <p>In Iraq, women are winning Purple Hearts and Bronze Stars for valour in a manner never seen before -machine-gunning Iraqi insurgents during urban ambushes, flying combat helicopters and firing missiles while being fired at, and in many cases saving the lives of the men fighting alongside them. But almost more remarkable than the statistics and the colourful stories is the fact that this has become a normal part of the battlefield landscape. Mothers, sisters, daughters, wives and girlfriends fighting, being blown up, shot at and shooting back -and dying in record numbers in the combat zone -has not provoked the apocalyptic collapse in male military morale and the national outrage that those opposed to women in combat have long predicted.</p>
      <p>There has been no outcry. Whether you regard this as a triumph or a pyrrhic victory for feminism is a moot point.</p>
      <p>"There is no reason for women not to be in combat. It's a buddy system -you look after the person next to you whether they are male or female. Once you are a soldier, that's the way it is, a soldier is a soldier," Sonnheim says.</p>
      <p>She admits that respect from the men was not automatic but, once earned for a job well done, it simply made the whole unit into her "other family".</p>
      <p>As a "weekend warrior" with the National Guard, Sonnheim had no idea that her unit would end up in Baghdad. But now she says: "If I had the choice I would go back to Iraq. I do not feel like I have betrayed them, because I got injured, but I want to be with them."</p>
      <p>Sonnheim is a striking sight in her neat, green MP uniform, a patch over her left eye and an angry scar on her right cheek. She pulls up her sleeve an inch or two to reveal a wrist pockmarked with black fragments under the skin.</p>
      <p>"Shrapnel. You don't want to see my legs, they are a mess," she says with a wry smile.</p>
      <p>A nurse in civilian life, Sonnheim says that her husband Dennis froze with shock when he first saw her in hospital. "He was very angry at what the military had done to his wife. They had told him that I was OK -ie, not dead. He's very sensitive," she says.</p>
      <p>Women have made giant leaps towards the front line in the past ten years, commanding naval ships and flying fighter planes and Stealth bombers on combat missions.</p>
      <p>During the first Gulf War, the very presence of women truck drivers in army support units in Kuwait drew media comment and all hell broke loose when two servicewomen were taken as prisoners of war.</p>
      <p>Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women in 1994, but they still cannot serve in the infantry, artillery or special forces and are not officially sent into combat on the ground. That accounts for the fact that while women make up some 10 per cent of the forces deployed in Iraq, they are suffering only 2 or 3 per cent of the deaths because they are not fighting in ground offensives.</p>
      <p>One woman who paid the ultimate price was Captain Kimberly Hampton, 27, who was shot down by an Iraqi missile fired at her Kiowa combat helicopter as she flew it near Fallujah in January.</p>
      <p>Kimberly, the only child of Ann and Dale Hampton, became the first US woman pilot to be killed in combat. Her funeral brought out almost the entire small town of Easley, South Carolina, as the former tennis champion and local golden girl took her last journey in a casket draped in the Stars and Stripes on the back of a horse-drawn carriage -past her weeping parents and fiance Captain Will Braman.</p>
      <p>"This is a 100 per cent volunteer army. The women should be given the opportunity to serve their country in any job if they feel the need and the desire," says her mother Ann, who adds that Kimberly's ambition was to make it to the rank of general. Her daughter was "a perfectionist and born aviator" who wrote in school essays about her dream to fly.</p>
      <p>A letter from Kimberly arrived after her death, thanking her parents for the parcel of snacks and puzzles they had sent her in Iraq.</p>
      <p>"She didn't consider herself a female soldier, but a pilot serving her country who happened to be a female," says her mother. "I miss her. There won't be a wedding or grandchildren. I'm terribly sad and empty, but there are hundreds of other families going through the same grief."</p>
      <p>If Lory Manning gets her way, it will not be a 100 per cent volunteer army in future but a drafted one -with women called up in the same lottery as men.</p>
      <p>This controversial stance is prompted by her anger that most young Americans who sign up for the military, many of them teenagers, state that their main reason for doing so is the opportunity to be given college fees. In a country where going to college means paying fees that range from a few thousand a year to $ 40,000 for the Ivy League, the scholarships that come automatically with serving are effectively used as bribes.</p>
      <p>In all the furore that surrounded young Jessica Lynch when she was taken prisoner last April, little attention was paid to the fact that the Army's new poster girl joined up only to try to get to college and improve her job prospects in her little backwoods town in West Virginia.</p>
      <p>"The rich go straight to college and the poor go into the Army," Manning says.</p>
      <p>She believes that this -not whether women are going to the front line -is the national scandal.</p>
      <p>But for Elaine Donnelly, president of the Centre for Military Readiness in Washington, the problem is still simply that "the concept of equality does not fit in combat environments. Women in combat units endanger male morale and military performance."</p>
      <p>Not so, says Sergeant Troy Tuschel, a colleague of Susan Sonnheim in the Wisconsin National Guard. "In Iraq, especially, the men have gained a lot more respect for the women. They hump around the heaviest machineguns. I have seen some men do a lot more bitching and whining than the women. We cannot do without them out there," he says.</p>
      <p>The US Department of Defence has even studied redesigning combat trousers to give women a flap of material so that they can squat and urinate without having to expose themselves or step off the road into a potential minefield while on patrol with male colleagues. However, military experts are leaning towards issuing women with the kind of devices used by female astronauts and mountain climbers.</p>
      <p>Sonnheim points out that women soldiers in Iraq are already improvising by carrying around long-stemmed plastic petrol funnels.</p>
      <p>"They are usually Day-Glo orange or red and we cover them with green duct tape.</p>
      <p>One woman I know can use it standing up," she says.</p>
      <p>Manning believes it is only a matter of time before women are officially put into combat on the ground. The change in mind-set required is, she says, "not so much about dying -women have always died in wars, especially nurses. It is more about them being allowed to fight back."</p>
      <p>One young Texan, Teresa Broadwell, fought back all right. Just 20, she was sent to Iraq last summer as a full-time member of the 194th Military Police Company. Her family had to overfeed her pancakes to help her to make the 100lb (45.4kg) enlistment minimum weight -her mother says that she looks about 12 and calls her Private Benjamin "because she is so girly". But Broadwell's moment of truth came when her convoy of armoured Humvees raced to support troops who had been ambushed in Karbala.</p>
      <p>At 5ft 4in (1.63m), Broadwell could not see squarely through the turret's gunsights but used the tracer bullets streaking from the machinegun to lay down ground fire to allow the wounded to be evacuated and protect other members of her unit. She killed at least six Iraqi fighters, and then shot down an incoming missile.</p>
      <p>She was awarded the Bronze Star with a distinction for valour, one of about 50 awarded in Iraq so far. And, as she had hurt her back when a grenade rocked the Humvee, she was also awarded the Purple Heart. She sent both medals back to her mother in Lewisville, Dallas, where neighbours said they could not believe "Little Bitty Teresa" had fought like that.</p>
      <p>"To me she is my little girl and I worry. It was not the intention to have women in the front line but it is what happens over there. Women must be allowed to do what they want to do," says her mother.</p>
      <p>The downside of equality, apart from dying in combat, also shows its face in the female US soldiers photographed taunting Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. And the only woman in command in the war zone was Major-General Janis Karpinski, who is one of the officers at the centre of the abuse scandal.</p>
      <p>Manning agrees that equality comes in many forms, not all of them ideal.</p>
      <p>"But if women want to be chief executives and Supreme Court judges -and President of the United States -they should not be allowed to escape the rest of it," she says.</p>

      <p>THE FAIRER SEX?</p>
      <p>"The female reluctance to embrace the horrors of war can help to preserve peace.</p>
      <p>This could not be achieved by a feminised military, which might have the reverse consequence, as de-natured women degrade their sex...by feminising their forces, the Americans may also have brutalised them. These photographs would have been far less shocking if the US troops had been male"</p>
      <p>BRUCE ANDERSON, THE SPECTATOR</p>
      <p>"Had (Brigadier-General Janis L. Karpinski) spent as much time leading her troops as she apparently has preparing for appearances on MSNBC, the Army might have stemmed these incidents early on"</p>

      <p>"Her (Lynndie England's) wanton sadism denies the natural virtues of womanhood: compassion, gentleness and the capacity to conciliate"</p>
      <p>LAWRENCE JAMES, DAILY MAIL</p>
      <p>YOUR ARMY NEEDS YOU</p>
      <p>The involvement of women soldiers in the prisoner-abuse scandal has not so far affected recruitment, according to Lory Manning, of the Centre for Women in Uniform, in Washington. "There is no evidence after just a few days of this denting the recruitment of women, but as time goes on it may well do," she says.</p>
      <p>"There is the whole sense of 'what the heck is going on out there and who is in charge...I would think twice about going.</p>
      <p>"Women considering signing up, and families with women who might sign up, will be thinking it's dangerous and that no one seems to be in control. Even if no women were involved (in the Abu Ghraib scandal) it would be a horror show, but that makes it all the more awful that they are."</p>

      <title>Cycling in the land of giants: my epic trip in the Faroe Islands</title>
      <subtitle>Activity holidayPaul Bloomfield sets off on a new bike tour, with challenging climbs, incredible landscapes … and some very unusual food</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>There's a simple explanation for some of the most striking topography on the Faroe Islands, and it hasn't got anything to do with glaciers or tectonic plates.</p>
      <p>"The giant and the witch, planning to tow the islands back to Iceland, tied a rope around Eidiskollur mountain," the guide said, nodding at a nearby peak. "But the mountain cracked - you can still see the notch. And as they struggled, the sun rose and turned them to stone, creating these huge sea stacks, Risin and Kellingun."</p>
      <p>OK, I'll buy that in a land roamed by huldufolk (hidden people, or elves), trolls and suchlike. But why did the larcenous Icelanders want to make off with the Faroes? A look of incomprehension fell over the guide's face.</p>
      <p>"Why? Because they're so beautiful, of course!" Plenty of people are proud of their homeland, but I have yet to visit another country whose citizens are so convinced of its aesthetic superiority. To be fair, the Faroese have a point. It's awesome, in the literal, demanding-of-awe sense. Vertiginous cliffs loom from volatile seas, waterfalls tumble, valleys sweep, rock columns soar. It's certainly epic enough to give Iceland a run for its www.krona.No wonder giants covet it.</p>
      <p>The genesis legend of those rock columns, off the surf-smashed north coast of Eysturoy island, was just one of several such yarns I was spun during a week cycling around the Faroes. The geological story is a little more prosaic, but no less dramatic. About 50 million years ago these 18 basalt islands emerged from the Atlantic near Greenland; then feisty Iceland barged in, forcing the Faroes eastwards. Today they lie in storm-lashed isolation north of the Outer Hebrides.</p>
      <p>The remote location and climatic turmoil helps to explain why this tiny nation clings to such myths, its culture rooted in Norse heritage dating back to Viking settlement 12 centuries ago. Though officially part of Denmark, the country is not a member of the EU. It has its own government, flag, national dress, cuisine, traditions and a language that's a Viking relic, studded with curious ancient characters and pretty much unpronounceable by all but the locals.</p>
      <p>Most visitors are cruise-ship passengers or self-drivers - distances are small, so exploring by car or coach is easy. Cycling, though, isn't an obvious holiday choice. One glance at a map shows the absurdity of suggesting a "circuit". In a country shaped (or misshaped) like half of a particularly squiggly Rorschach blot, roads wend where they can, skirting round fjords and hairpinning up sheer hillsides, rarely in a straight line.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, biking is a great way of absorbing the subtly changing views - as long as you can absorb the hills. So I ventured out on a new, week-long, selfguided cycling tour, scooting around six central islands linked by bridges, causeways and tunnels.</p>
      <p>Opening the curtains on my first morning at the charmingly retro Guesthouse Hugo in Sorvagur, site of the international (well, only) airport, on the westerly island of Vagar, I was greeted by the sight of an Arctic tern hovering above the fjord. Birds, I quickly discovered, are ever-present, more so even than the sheep that outnumber humans almost two to one. The coast throngs with seabirds, while the interior bustles with delightfully monikered ynglefugle - breeding birds, nesting on moors and hillsides.</p>
      <p>Heading east, past the airport, I noticed that the scenic splendour cranked up rapidly. I soon arrived at the shores of Sorvagsvatn, dotted with typical turfroofed fishermen's cabins. At the seaward end of this lake, where its waters empty down a gushing cataract into the Atlantic, it is said that Vikings would hurl worn-out slaves to their deaths.</p>
      <p>Today's Faroese are a more welcoming bunch; a little reserved, perhaps, but invariably helpful and keen to espouse their country's highlights. Just an hour into my ride, at the viewpoint for Trollkonufingur - a rock believed to be the raised finger of a female troll - I was joined by a local jogger pausing for breath. "From here you can see six of our eighteen islands," she gasped proudly, indicating craggy shapes looming from the battleship-grey ocean. "There's Streymoy and Koltur, with Hestur peeking from behind. Then Suduroy and Skuvoy beyond." I asked her to name her favourite spot on the islands and she unleashed a list longer than this story can encompass. Suffice to say, there's not a lot of ugly here.</p>
      <p>Back on the main road, I encountered the three main challenges faced by cyclists. First came a long, uphill haul to the pass between the peaks of Malinstindur and Reynsatindur. These volcanic islands are far from flat, having some of Europe's highest sea cliffs, and mountains rising above 800m - hardly Himalayan, but testing enough.</p>
      <p>Then the wind surged, buffeting so powerfully it almost brought me to a standstill on the steep downhill. And just when I'd recovered my breath at the foot of the pass, the road vanished into the 5km-long undersea tunnel between Vagar and the neighbouring island of Streymoy. Frankly, it was heart-in-mouth stuff. In a concrete tube 100m beneath sea level, even a Fiat 500 booms like Concorde, while trucks roar with the wrath of Thor at Ragnarok. On emerging, I vowed not to repeat the experience; fortunately, buses (which carry bikes) offer safe passage through most tunnels. All told, it was a chastening start to my ride.</p>
      <p>But then things have never been easy here. The Vikings who colonised the islands in the 9th century were, in the main, not so heavy on the raping and pillaging, despite some gruesome bloodshed described in ancient Faroese sagas. Rather, life revolved - and still does - around sheep farming and reaping the ocean's harvests. That much was clear as I pedalled past fish farms, trawlers at anchor and the abandoned whaling station of Vid Air, while detours revealed further hardships endured by the Faroese.</p>
      <p>At Vestmanna I joined a boat tour to the islands' most famous bird cliffs, chugging through teal-hued seas past rafts of puffins, and beneath 600m-high rock faces lined with nesting fulmars, razorbills and guillemots. Lengths of rope dangled down the soaring cliffs, unfurled by men abseiling to harvest eggs and birds. I'd earlier tasted (and loathed) roast guillemot; those guys must have been truly desperate.</p>
      <p>I pedalled through the Saksunardalur Valley, which was echoing with the staccato thweeps of whimbrels and indignant calls of oystercatchers, past swaying cottongrass, buttercups and pink ragged-robin. At its end, the farmhouse museum at Saksun follows a design little changed since the Middle Ages. Even a new extension, refurbished in the 1940s and inhabited until the 1970s, is primitive, its wooden sleeping stalls embedded in walls flanking a central area for cooking, living and working. The setting may be idyllic, with tumbling waterfalls feeding a picturesque lagoon, but daily life must have been anything but.</p>
      <p>At the end-of-the-world hamlet of Tjornuvik, I gazed across at the giant and witch sea stacks. Pausing at the village's recently excavated Viking burial ground, I pondered what could prompt even the hardiest Norsemen to settle in this spot - beautiful, yes, but isolated and forbidding in all but the sunniest weather. And sun is far from guaranteed; the "four seasons in one day" aphorism is wheeled out as often as the waterproof jackets. Which is to say, very often indeed.</p>
      <p>Pretty coastal villages in prettier locations are not in short supply. Gjogv and Vidareidi made gorgeous overnight stops, while Kunoy and Gasadalur were worthy side trips from my prescribed route. Aside from views, though, visitor facilities are sparse - petrol stations provide the only pitstops on many stretches. So the low-rise capital, Torshavn (pronounced, roughly, "Toe-ur-shaown"), offered a welcome dash of contemporary convenience in the caffeine wilderness.</p>
      <p>As in most Faroese settlements, the city's heart is the harbour, a little-and-large show where a city-sized cruise ship dwarfed fishing boats bobbing at anchor. Rows of warehouses, cafés and shops in rainbow tones add a splash of colour, while metal tables act as impromptu market stalls for hot-desking fisherman. Climbing east, I became happily lost in the maze of alleys spidering the quaint medieval district of Tinganes, where tar-blackened old houses huddle close together on a rocky spit, grassy eaves nearly touching, in defiance of the elements.</p>
      <p>So much for the ancient; the modern came with the Faroes' - and, reputedly, Scandinavia's - finest dining, at Koks (koks.fo) in Kirkjubour, a little south of the centre. Here Poul Andrias Ziska embraces local ingredients (his favoured sources of nettles and seaweed are visible from the restaurant window) and traditional raest fermentation techniques to produce a parade of exquisite dishes that, in February, gained him the islands' first Michelin star.</p>
      <p>I initially blanched at a menu featuring fulmar and sheep's head, but the former, delicately minced, nestled in a beetroot rose, while the latter comprised a kind of posh shepherd's pie; both were heavenly.

      <title>Focus of inquiry shifts to points that were installed in the 1980s</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Investigators are expected to announce initial findings today as fears grow over upkeep of mainline track, report</p>
      <p>The investigation into the train crash in Cumbria which killed one passenger and seriously injured eight is focusing on a set of points that were more than 20 years old.</p>
      <p>The Rail Accident Investigation Branch will issue a preliminary report today which is expected to give details of when the points were last inspected and adjusted.</p>
      <p>Network Rail declined to comment on reports that nuts were seen to be missing from bolts on the points after the crash, but a spokesman said that the condition of the points was a "central element of the investigation".</p>
      <p>Margaret Masson, 84, of Glasgow, died after the crash. Eleven people remain in hospital, including Iain Black, 46, the driver of the London to Glasgow Virgin train, who suffered a broken collar bone and a broken bone in his neck.</p>
      <p>The locomotive of the train is believed to have derailed at 90mph at the points but to have continued upright for a few seconds before falling down an embankment.</p>
      <p>The locomotive, which suffered the worst damage, is thought to have hit a trackside stanchion, used to support electric wires that feed power to the train.</p>
      <p>The impact caused it to jackknife back on to the other carriages.</p>
      <p>Network Rail checked 700 similar sets of points over the weekend and found no problems. It said that the points at Grayrigg, near Kendal, were installed 20 to 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>They were rarely used but should have been visually inspected once a week and serviced every 13 weeks. Network Rail said late last night that an inspection had been carried out on February 3. The process should have involved checking that the points were in good working order and making any necessary adjustments.</p>
      <p>Network Rail said that every action taken should have been logged on an information recording system set up after the Potters Bar crash in May 2002.</p>
      <p>Badly maintained points were the cause of that crash and safety inspectors criticised the absence of guidance or instructions for inspecting and maintaining the points.</p>
      <p>Stan Hall, former head of operational safety at British Rail, said that the failure of the Potters Bar inquiry to establish the exact cause of the crash had meant important lessons may not have been learnt by the industry.</p>
      <p>"It was clear that better checks needed to be carried out on points but, without knowing the root cause, it was difficult to ensure it never happened again. This is the first serious challenge to Network Rail's safety regime, which had been unparalleled."</p>
      <p>The company said it had recognised that points were a critical part of the network from a safety point of view and had more than tripled the rate of replacement undertaken by Railtrack.</p>
      <p>Police and firemen expressed amazement that there had not been more deaths after carriages were strewn on their sides across fields. Unlike in previous crashes, none of the windows broke and carriages remained intact.</p>
      <p>The three-year-old Pendolino train has small, double-laminated windows, a reinforced shell with roll cages and carriage couplings designed to absorb impact.</p>
      <p>The line between Preston and Carlisle is likely to remain closed, with coaches replacing trains, until early next week.</p>
      <p>Chief Superintendent Martyn Ripley, of the British Transport Police, said that heavy duty lifting equipment would not be on site to begin moving the carriages until tomorrow morning at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Two train data recorders, similar to the black boxes found on aircraft, have been recovered and will be analysed today.</p>
      <p>Mr Black is expected to remain in hospital for several weeks. Last night he was heavily sedated and in a serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Mrs Masson's daughter, Margaret Langley, 61, and her husband Richard, 63, of Southport, Merseyside, who were in the same carriage, were seriously injured. They remained at the Royal Preston Hospital with other passengers, including Richard Blakemore, 54, from Reading, and Graeme Stewart, 28, an IT consultant living in London, both of whom were in a comfortable condition last night. A sixth patient faces neurosurgery.</p>
      <p>Andrew Curran, a consultant in emergency medicine at the Royal Preston Hospital, said: "Mr Black is conscious at the moment. He's obviously very shocked and upset about what's happened."</p>
      <p>The investigation</p>
      <p>1 Train left London Euston at 5.15pm heading for Glasgow</p>
      <p>2 Possible faulty set of points 320 metres away</p>
      <p>3 Derailed at 90mph, shortly after 8pm on Friday, near the village of Grayrigg, Cumbria</p>
      <p>4 Motor unit spins round facing in opposite direction</p>
      <p>The points</p>
      <p>The points being investigated are 320 metres away from the crash site. They allow trains to switch tracks but are used only when maintenance is being done.</p>
      <p>They are released by a signal centre at Carlisle and operated by workers at the site. The points are visually inspected once a week and undergo maintenance every 13 weeks. However Network Rail could not confirm when they had last been maintained.</p>
      <p>Europe's safest train</p>
      <p>The train was one of virgin's 53 Pendolinos, unveiled in July 2001, which have a maximum speed of 140mph.</p>
      <p>Their robust structure means that passengers can sit in the front carriage, not allowed in older trains for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>The carriages have crumple zones and couplings between the carriages also withstand impact, to avoid damage from carriages being pushed on top of each other.</p>
      <p>Small strengthened windows in carriages minimise glass injuries in a crash. None of the windows broke during Friday's crash.</p>
      <p>Hard items inside the carriages are rounded and cushioned to prevent slicing injuries.</p>
      <p>Seats are built higher so passengers are less likely to be flung from their place. or hit by luggage at up to 8 degrees. If the carriages had not slid down an embankment they may have remained</p>

      <title>Not a cultural backwater, but a creative industry in full flow</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>There are more of them than museums and they are better attended than football grounds. What are they? Libraries, of course. Nicolette Jones looks to their future</p>
      <p>Libraries are not what they were. They are not even what they have been popularly misconceived to be: staid and slightly outmoded cultural backwaters. A conference held this week at the British Library, entitled Reading Nation and addressed by the Poet Laureate Andrew Motion and the Arts Minister Alan Howarth, proved that libraries are where it's at. Businesses - including Asda supermarkets and Ford Motor Company - have gone into imaginative partnerships with libraries and won over customers and enthused their staff.</p>
      <p>Government has recognised that libraries have power to change communities, that they are ideally placed to further its own declared goals of social cohesion, fostering the creative industries and providing access to education for all for life. And, above all, the lives of readers have been affected by libraries reaching out to them in new and exciting ways.</p>
      <p>Libraries have an edge over all sorts of other cultural and leisure institutions. They are more numerous than museums, better attended than football grounds, and less elitist than universities. People who walk into libraries always do so because they want to. There are some 4,500 public libraries in Britain (600 of them mobile), 58 per cent of the population have a library card, and 480 million books are borrowed every year. Libraries have links with community groups and other organisations that give them a wide reach. No one is excluded because they lack a qualification or can't afford the fees.</p>
      <p>Last year was a watershed for libraries. The National Year of Reading prompted both government investment (for connecting all libraries to the National Grid for Learning by 2002) and some inspired ideas to encourage reading. In Blackpool, for instance, a library was taken on to the beach. In Oldham, the Dewey system was bypassed in favour of other methods of classification, such as "books about people more miserable than me". "Foraging" schemes allowed you to choose a book by criteria such as a happy ending and not much sex, or sad with plenty of bad language. The London Transport Museum used librarians' skills in workshops that led to a poetry website. And in Manchester you got reduced admission to the Giants' basketball games if you showed a library card.</p>
      <p>The Reading Nation conference showed off some of the good ideas of the National Year of Reading and how they will, or can, be built on. Behind the conference, and behind many of the year's initiatives, were two organisations, Launch Pad and the Reading Partnership, established to set up projects to promote reading among young people and adults respectively. They did a lot to take libraries outside their own walls, bringing books and the expertise of staff into all sorts of unlikely places.</p>
      <p>The supermarket chain Asda was persuaded, for a fortnight last May, to have 450 storytelling sessions, under the banner "The Big Read", in its foyers and aisles, run by staff who had been specially trained by librarians, while 120 mobile libraries were set up in Asda car parks. To date, less than 1 per cent of the Pounds 141million that businesses invest in the arts goes to library-linked projects, but Asda got so much out of it in terms of delighted customers, happy staff (who could go home to use their newly learnt reading skills on their own children) and press coverage, that it thinks its money very well spent. And in the process of finding new customers, it did what government, educationists and the book trade are always trying to do - it found new readers.</p>
      <p>So did Ford, when it agreed to wheel a book trolley into the Dagenham body plant, with a selection from local libraries. Bim Singh, a plant worker, told the conference how the brevity of the lunchbreak and the long hours of his shifts meant there was no chance of him going to a library during the week, but that the trolley allowed him to choose books for himself to exercise his mind after his repetitive job, and for his eight-year-old son, for whom Dad coming home from work with books to read was altogether a surprise.</p>
      <p>Government investment in technology in libraries has given rise to the idea that they aren't doing enough to advocate books. But while their tactics were innovative, all these partnerships between libraries and other organisations principally revolved around good old books - boxes of them were ferried around the country to infiltrate bookless locations. And they gave people both a knowledge of books and a confidence to use them. One fine example of this was in Norfolk, where the dinner ladies at 50 rural schools were trained by librarians to read stories, from a selection of books about eating. After they'd served up the chips, they sat down to read to the children. It improved relationships between the catering staff and pupils, it encouraged the staff to read to their families outside work, and the children went on to write stories about food that were collected in a book. Some of the dinner ladies are still reading to pupils every week.</p>
      <p>In some cases the projects returned to the most ancient impulses to enjoy stories, as in Southampton where, at a community centre for Asian elders, grandparents recounted the tales their grandparents had told them, made their own puppets and props to accompany stories in "story sacks", and then performed their stories for a new generation. The spin-off of ventures like this in human terms went far beyond education and entertainment. As one Asian grandmother put it, at the storytelling sessions, one day a week, "people listen to us. The rest of the time ..." and she made a zipping-up motion across her mouth.</p>
      <p>The current buzz phrase of libraries is "reader development" - emphasising neither authors nor text, but the reader's personal growth. Andrew Motion's address gave an instance of what this can mean: he quoted a 14-year-old who had played truant from school for eight months, and went to an "attendance project" on one of Newcastle's roughest estates. He "couldn't get into it", until one day they read W. H. Auden's Stop All the Clocks and he loved it. He photocopied it. "The next day our teacher said, jokingly I think, 'Stop all the clocks'. I replied, 'Cut off the telephone'. We went right through the poem saying a line each. All the lads were impressed - I thought they might take the mick but they didn't. The poem makes me remember my Grandad in a nice way and reminds me how I nearly lost my brother Robert. The poem calms you down and makes you realise how important your friends and family are. The words flow together and kind of soothe you."</p>
      <p>Reading, Motion's address implied, saves lives. It also, he pointed out, creates writers. Writers need good readers to complete the cycle of their work; someone has to grasp what is written.</p>
      <p>The Government is in favour of "reader development" too. It has put Pounds 2 million into a Reader Development Programme for 2000-01. To promote reading is to promote a tolerant society - people who read understand how other people think, and see other points of view.</p>
      <p>The next big chance for libraries to change lives is on World Book Day, March 10, when along with schools, bookshops and the media, they will host and prompt furious literary activity. In the summer the Reading Relay will co-ordinate events for children in every library in the country. As one of the conference speakers said, libraries are not only places that foster the creative industries, they constitute a creative industry themselves.</p>

      <title>ADDICTS REUNITED</title>
      <subtitle>In the Eighties, David Jenkins, a TV producer at the time, suffered massive heart failure, caused by his dependency on drink and drugs. He ended up in Clouds House, a Wiltshire treatment centre. As it celebrates its 25th year, he attends an unlikely reunion there - think Irvine Welsh at the village fête - with two fellow members of the Class of '87</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>So here we are, three middle-aged men, piling into a Prius and setting off for a reunion at the drink and drug clinic we attended. We've stayed in touch, sort of, since we graduated 22 years ago, but we're not so sure what's happened to the rest of our gang. Michael Coplans, balding, bouncy and full of pep, sets the ball rolling. "What happened to Rupert? He was even posher than you."</p>
      <p>"Yeah," I say, "and famous for shooting up through his jacket. He couldn't even be bothered to take his jacket off."</p>
      <p>"Through his trousers," Philip interjects. "Even through his shoes, probably. I shared a dorm with him. He's still around - he married a prostitute."</p>
      <p>"And there was Nigel," says Coplans, "the smack dealer from Southampton - he was clean, last time I saw him."</p>
      <p>"Nigel," says Philip. "He's distinguished in my mind because when his wife visited him, they shagged in the bushes - which, of course, was dead against the rules."</p>
      <p>That's treatment centres for you: "A hothouse for fevered gossip, intrigue and speculation," as Philip remembers ours. (A note on these names: Philip is a pseudonym, adopted for the sake of keeping this member of Narcotics Anonymous anonymous.</p>
      <p>Michael Coplans has waived his anonymity, as have I.) The three of us were in Clouds House, Wiltshire, in January/February 1987. Then a television producer and 38 years old, I'd just suffered massive heart failure and had, I was told, clinically died four times in the night. My case notes read "alcoholic myocarditis", which was accurate but left out the heroin, cocaine and other things I was taking.</p>
      <p>Michael came into Clouds, aged 31, weighing 7½ stone, the son of a doctor, a man "reduced to sleeping in the corridors of friends' blocks of flats". Careers as a croupier, bingo caller and timeshare salesman had not flourished. Heroin was his drug of choice. Philip, an artist, was coming off a major heroin and alcohol bender that had been going for a couple of years. His lover had just killed herself, he had no money, another</p>
      <p>junkie was living in his flat and he recalls standing, bleakly, in a corridor at Clouds and a treatment counsellor coming by and saying, "Cheer up. It can't be all bad." All three of us have now been clean and sober for years. "This is where it started," says Michael, of Clouds. "This is where I got clean," says Philip.</p>
      <p>It couldn't be a more beautiful day. The house - Grade II* listed, and in use as a treatment centre for the past 25 years - looks gorgeous in the sunlight. The gardens are immaculate, the badminton court freshly marked. There's a huge white marquee on the lawn; beyond a ha-ha are meadows and, in the fold of the valley, a village. There's tea and lemonade on sale, and people are lolling on the grass. There are lots of floral print dresses to be seen, and tattoos, and shorts, and taut T-shirts and Panama hats.</p>
      <p>Conversation drifts on the air: "Dormitories were not unusual for me…" "Didn't we first meet post-treatment?" "I was the token Jewish patient…" "Melanie's been sitting her GCSEs and doing fine - it's a bloody miracle." The main meeting kicks off at 2.30pm; it's 12.30. Had we got here earlier, we could have listened to Mustard Seed, the happy-clappy house "rock" band - known, inevitably, as "Hey, hey, we're the junkies".</p>
      <p>As it is, we wander around, our first names on tags, grabbing salads from the food bar and clocking the 300 or so men and women gathered here. Almost all are alcoholics and addicts (though there are children here, too, and wives and husbands). Almost all have participated in Clouds' six-week treatment course - a course built on the classic 12-step tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, garnished with gruelling group therapy sessions, lots of written self-excavation and much confrontation.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are 38 "clients", or inmates - there were nearer 50 in my day - and it's a rolling course: people arrive, people leave, people get chucked out. They're divided into groups, organised in dormitories, and then they begin treatment. The place is much smarter these days - there's Farrow &amp; Ball paint on the walls. Nick Barton, director of treatment, has a joyous tale to tell. A couple of years back, he got a letter from a former client saying, "You'll never be a centre of excellence with a leaky roof." Enclosed was a cheque for £250,000. A success story, all round.</p>
      <p>In fact, many Clouds clients are sent by local health authorities, and Clouds makes a loss on their treatment, so staff wouldn't mind a few more private patients. Not that there's any difference in the treatment or accommodation anyone gets. Some treatment centres, one counsellor tells me, effectively advertise that they're for PLU (people like us) - no roughnecks here. He argues - and I agree - that it's better for alcoholics and addicts of all classes to mix: it shows them exactly how alike they are in their addictions. Which is why, as we meander round, Philip remembers the staunchly Republican Irish "foot soldier" who got compassionate leave to attend a funeral and came back, drunk as a skunk, claiming that his cousins held a gun to his head and forced him to drink. I conjure up the dorm-mate whose life, each day, had involved going to Swindon railway station, entering the toilets, squatting on a lavatory seat and glugging his way through three bottles of British sherry. We had a burglar in our group, too: no sign of him today. Indeed, no sign of any other contemporaries.</p>
      <p>Still, out in the sunshine, everyone's got a story: Russell was here almost the first year Clouds opened. In with him was Viv Stanshall, front man of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. "We wrote an alcoholics' version of The Twelve Days of Christmas together: one line went, 'Threeee Special Brews…'." Christopher, who's giving the main share (or talk), recalls the woman addict who came downstairs after a night's detoxing and said, "Even my eyelashes are aching." A current client, weak and pale, pale, pale, tells me what a "soap opera" the whole thing is - that rings a bell.</p>
      <p>Though how would I know? I didn't make it through the six weeks. In my group, there was a young woman called Rachel. One day, our counsellor, Bob (an ex-Army ranker I liked a lot), suddenly told her that he knew she'd slept with a recent inmate - something that was vigorously frowned upon. (The rationale is that addicts/alcoholics in early recovery are</p>
      <p>vulnerable and a romance is very likely to end in tears - tears that'll seem fixable by a shot or a drink. So, no frolicking for the first 12 months of sobriety.) She denied it. Bob approached me and another guy; if we got Rachel to fess up, he said, he was sure she'd benefit, psychologically. And there'd be no repercussions. We persuaded Rachel, and she did seem better. Then Bob went off, sick, and I found Rachel on the stairs, weeping. She was being thrown out. For me, that was it: the whole programme hinged on trust, and trust had been broken. I left, after four weeks. "Ah," says Claire Clarke, head of service at Clouds, "perhaps you were just looking for an excuse."</p>
      <p>Starting over</p>
      <p>Maybe she's right. Certainly, Michael and Philip stayed the course, and they've been far more assiduous than me at going to NA meetings. And certainly, the very first thing I did was, you'd think, foolish - go to a stag do. But I took nothing, and I attended meetings, and I went back to my job and I kept toiling away to pay the mortgage and send my two (now grown up) children to private school. I haven't drunk since leaving Clouds - though I remember early on being terrified by going to some press launch and finding that the orange juice I'd just knocked back was, in fact, a vodka and orange. I ran to the loo and swilled out my mouth.</p>
      <p>What else? Well, I did smoke a little dope, but it made me paranoid in the extreme. And I certainly didn't like being in a room where there was heroin. The presence of drink has never worried me - fortunately, for I'm a party-loving person - but repetitious drunks bore the pants off me. Life? Since treatment, I've been made redundant, had cancer (I'm in my fourth year of remission), and recently moved in with my girlfriend. I very rarely go to meetings and I can't say I never ever think about drink or drugs - indeed, so beautiful were the surroundings at the Port Eliot literary festival this summer, I couldn't help thinking how wonderful it would be to drop acid there. Euphoric recall is the NA term for that.</p>
      <p>Philip emerged from Clouds amazed that they hadn't sent him to a halfway house - a secure, recovery-orientated establishment between treatment and the outside world. "I assumed they must think me such a hopeless case it wasn't worth bothering." While Philip was at Clouds, some NA heavies had winkled his junkie lodger out of his flat. But, as he walked in - before, indeed, he'd sat down - the phone rang. It was the police: a prostitute had been found murdered. Philip and his ex-flatmate's names and number had been found in her bag. Had he anything to do with it? He hadn't, of course, but it threw him. "But then the idea of the Serenity Prayer [a prayer often read at the end of NA/AA meetings] occurred to me, and I used it as a tool to divide what I could change and what I had to accept."</p>
      <p>Clean, he's worked pretty successfully in the arts. He's had a child, though he and the mother are separated. He's got a cluttered flat in West London and a big brass bed. He goes to meetings and is serious about helping others in NA. "It would be sheer bad manners not to, seeing how much I've got out of it. And it's something I'm expert at: I know how to drink and take drugs, and I know how to be clean and sober."</p>
      <p>Michael left Clouds for a halfway house in Bristol. His first job in recovery was "as a dance partner at an Age Concern Dancing with the Blind class. I couldn't dance, but they couldn't see, so no one seemed to care." Back in London, an NA pal helped him become a "product demonstrator. He gave me some potato peelers, and I became the Peeler King - made some good money. I progressed to the Börner V-Slicer - the Rolls-Royce of vegetable tools, as I liked to say." Now he's an accomplished travel writer, has a rented flat in West London, and still worries about whether American Beauty or Workingman's Dead is the better Grateful Dead album. He, too, is serious about NA: in fact, he spent his first six or seven years clean immersed in it. "I did a huge amount. I set up meetings in Brixton Prison; I was secretary of a meeting in Wandsworth Prison. I needed that, initially."</p>
      <p>Here we three sit, then, in the marquee, listening to the speakers - a wonderful Scouser whose husband stopped drinking here, and for whom Clouds' Families Plus scheme provided a crucial lifeline; a recent alumnus (who wants to be a counsellor); a current client; Nick Barton, talking about the power of love; and Christopher, the main speaker, remembering how all the talk of love first put him off when he entered Clouds' darkling halls. Now Kirby Gregory, once of bands Curved Air and Stretch, now director of client services for Action on Addiction, is conducting a countdown, calling for former alumni to stand and remain standing each year from 1984 on. There are only we three, and Christopher, from 1987. But as each year is announced, up they stand, the Ians, Janices, Eleanors, Alans, Tinas, Brians et al. Eventually we're up to 2009, and the self-congratulatory applause is deafening. We link hands, say the Serenity Prayer, and I am, as ever, embarrassed to utter it.</p>
      <p>Outside, there's more tea to be had, and cake, and hugs and chat - one woman I talk to is having a very rough ride (job gone, husband gone, new business failing), but at least she's sober. Philip was "compelled to be moved. I had a spontaneous feeling of gratitude - a strong sense of 'Thank f*** I'm not where I was then.' " As for Michael, "You know, I've had a long-held cynicism about treatment centres, counsellors and people who worked in them, and it was really dispelled today. I realised this is where I actually got clean."</p>
      <p>And me? Mixed emotions. After all, it's where I walked out of, for what I still think were very good reasons. But it's also where the clean and sober ball started rolling for me.

And when the person introducing us says, "This is David, he was here in 1987," the young man's nervous eyes open wide, and he says, "Wow! So it does work, then."</p>

      <title>Children of the tsunami..one year on</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A few weeks after last year's tsunami, Janine Di Giovanni went to southern India to meet the orphans created by the 'Big Wave'. Now she returns, to find out how those children are coping with their new lives</p>
      <p>THALANGUDA, TAMIL NADU, SOUTHERN INDIA</p>
      <p>JANUARY, 2005</p>
      <p>The girl wore a yellow skirt and silver bracelets around her ankles and talked about the morning of the Big Wave. "Something was wrong at the beach," she says in a small voice. "The light was strange."</p>
      <p>In Vijitha's memory, there are still sounds and images: walking with her mother and her four-year-old brother to the beach to sell fish. Then a terrible loud sound. "And the earth split open under the ocean and the water came up." Vijitha, now ten, saw the wave and heard the screams. She ran far enough from the beach to climb a tree. But her mother was carrying her brother. She was caught by the water. Rescue workers found Vijitha hours later, bruised, and crying, one remembers, "as though her heart would break".</p>
      <p>Vijitha's father, Viswanathan, a 32-year-old fisherman, rises at 3am to go to work. When his wife and son died, he could no longer take care of Vijitha and her little sister, Vijyashree. His decision was brutal, but practical: he sent them to an orphanage. "The older one is stroppy and defiant," he tells me, weeks after the tsunami. "She needs discipline.</p>
      <p>She's too pretty." And he needed a new wife. The villagers pestered him.</p>
      <p>"In our culture, a man does not take care of children."</p>
      <p>This village, Thalanguda, is a traditional Tamil fishing village bordering the Bay of Bengal. This region, near Cuddalore, together with Nagapattinam, was one of the areas worst affected by the tsunami. Everyone seems to have lost someone: a mother, an uncle, a grandmother. There's a strange smell.</p>
      <p>"It's death," a villager says.</p>
      <p>In southern India alone, 934 villages were affected by the tsunami. More than two million people's lives were changed in one way or another. Twelve thousand people died and 541 children were orphaned. Seven hundred schools were lost. Now, weeks after the wave, Thalanguda still has a sense of chaos: flooded tracks leading to the beach, badly damaged shanty houses and the smell of unprocessed sewage. People look stunned. It's raining the day I arrive and flies bite my ankles.</p>
      <p>Life has always been hard here; now it's worse. People are poor. They are part of the fishing community, a lowly strata of society. Life was simple: the men went to the sea; the women to the beach to sell fish. The children are left to fend for themselves.</p>
      <p>The houses are small and dirty, with water in blue containers supplied by Unicef. Social workers say there is a problem with alcoholism. Children wander through the village alone, unclothed. I get the sense there is not, and has not been, a lot of love lavished on them, even before the crisis.</p>
      <p>When I ask one of the tsunami orphans if she misses her mother's hugs, she replies stoutly: "My mother never hugged me. She came back from the beach and was too tired."</p>
      <p>NOVEMBER, 2005</p>
      <p>Once the Big Wave came, there was a drastic change. The boats could not go out to the water for months. And there was foreign relief money pouring into these small communities, and government compensation. It complicated the structure of people's lives.</p>
      <p>"I was startled at how greedy some people became," one local relief worker, Glory Herbert, told me. Herbert told the story of how one local family killed their mother with poison in her coconut water, then buried her for three days before retrieving her body. "They tried to make it look as though she died in the tsunami to get the money. Because so much relief has come in, they forget the tragedy," she concludes. "They just want the money."</p>
      <p>A Unicef child-protection officer, Saji Thomas, is more blunt. "The psychological effect of the tsunami on village life is two-fold," he says.</p>
      <p>"First, there was the shock, the pain. That's the initial feeling. Then there was the inflow of relief money and strange people coming into their community. That creates a culture of dependency and expectation. Which is natural, but it changes their nature."</p>
      <p>It's a strange juxtaposition, especially for simple people. Viswanathan, the father of the girls, says all he knew was this village. He and his wife had an arranged marriage; she grew up in a hamlet nearby. When I ask if he loved her, he looks baffled. He shows me her photograph - the date of her death, 26-12-04, is written at the bottom. He shows me a photograph of his son who drowned that day, too. "We said goodbye that morning," he says.</p>
      <p>"Then someone came and said: 'The sea is rising! The sea is rising!'" He falls silent.</p>
      <p>After the death of his wife and son, Viswanathan received a settlement (some of which his mother-in-law insisted be kept for the girls when they grow up), and built a new house. It's a small place, built of concrete - but here, it is a palace. It is a signal that Viswanathan is now a rich man, and the villagers are reminding him every day to marry again.</p>
      <p>There's pressure on all the tsunami widowers to remarry. Leela Krishnan, a social worker, refers to this phenomenon as "tsunami weddings". So, a few weeks after his wife's death, Viswanathan looked for another wife and sent his daughters to a state orphanage.</p>
      <p>CUDDALORE, TAMIL NADU</p>
      <p>JANUARY, 2005</p>
      <p>Though it was not as miserable as, say, a Romanian orphanage, the two sisters hated the Government Home for Tsunami Affected Children in Cuddalore. They howled with indignation at their fate; howled at the loss of their mother; howled that dinner was served late. "We were hungry," says Vijyashree, the younger girl.</p>
      <p>In late January, when I first visited the orphanage, there were 45 children aged between one and 14, with six full-time workers. The children are given clothes, food, education, adult supervision and accommodation. What is missing, of course, is physical affection. But most of the children look too traumatised even to cry.</p>
      <p>There are a tiny brother and sister called Parthiban and Anitha who stand barefoot, clinging to each other, staring out into a strange world. They lost both their parents in the tsunami. At the time, they were playing near a Hindu temple, further away from the beach. It has been a priority for the Tamil Nadu Government to try to keep families of orphaned children together. These two are the most physically inseparable: you could not prise them apart if you tried. We lead them into a quiet room, and they stand submissively, as though waiting for some other disaster. We gently ask them what happened to their parents. "Our mother fell into the water and died," says Parthiban. He did not see his parents swept away, so he's confused about timing. "He's lost about the whole thing," says Mageshwari Ramesamy, who cares for the children. As to how he got to the orphanage, Parthiban will only say, "Someone came and took us away." His eyes fill with tears. Mageshwari moves closer, but Parthiban won't let her hug him.</p>
      <p>His sister jams her knuckles into her mouth. They leave the room, holding hands.</p>
      <p>Mageshwari says, as if by rote, that they are eating and sleeping well.</p>
      <p>They like the school, and activity at the orphanage keeps them busy. "But they must be terribly sad," I say. "Their world has been turned upside-down." Yes, she admits. "The boy knows his parents are no more. But he won't discuss it." There has not yet been a child psychologist in the orphanage. "The other kids who also lost parents in the tsunamiI seem all right," says Mageshwari. "But he has no life left in him. And his sister just clings to him."</p>
      <p>Inside the orphanage, there's sunshine streaming through windows, and laughter. There's a shelf of stuffed animals. It appears almost joyful. But when you take each child aside and talk to them, it's a parade of misery.</p>
      <p>This is compounded by the fact that in Indian society, orphans, even when they become adults, have a low standing. "When they get out, aged 18, there is virtually no support for them. People tend to think of them as tainted,"</p>
      <p>says Thomas George from Unicef, who has worked in the villages since the tsunami.</p>
      <p>Into the room comes a placid 11-month-old called Abhinaya, chewing a pink rabbit. She seems fat and contented, and the helpers vie to hold her. When the wave came, her mother threw her towards a balcony in an attempt to save her from the water. She managed to save the baby, but not herself. When rescue workers found Abhinaya three days later, she was in a coma. Her father decided to marry again. He took the baby to the orphanage as soon as she recovered.</p>
      <p>There are a teenage brother and sister who floated on a cushion for a day.</p>
      <p>There is a two-year-old girl, Suvina, who has not spoken since she saw her four-year old brother swept away by the wave.</p>
      <p>There is bedwetting, sleeplessness, defiance and anger. There are five pretty Krishnamurthy sisters wearing bright jewellery, aged four to 11, whose mother died on the beach. Their father survived, but he went to live in Malaysia, and, in the words of one orphanage worker, "does not want to be involved in the upbringing of his daughters". An aunt comes to see them.</p>
      <p>It is she who brought the necklaces.</p>
      <p>The girls line up in size order. The eldest, Sivarnjini, who is 11, is the one who will take over the role of mother. She looks exhausted. "They fight a lot, I have to separate them," is her only complaint.</p>
      <p>What do they remember? "They found our mother's body one day after the Big Wave," one of the younger sisters says. "We weren't allowed to see it.</p>
      <p>Everyone said it was smelly."</p>
      <p>Another sister, Siripriya, who is nine, has frenetic energy. One of the workers tells me she is "having trouble adjusting". Now she tells a story.</p>
      <p>"After the cremation I saw my mother's spirit rising," she says. "She was wearing a red sari and a grey blouse. She was crying: Oh, my five girls! They are still here walking on this earth alone!" The other sisters listen.</p>
      <p>"My father was standing next to me but he did not see her. My mother's face looked sad. She looked like she was sick."</p>
      <p>Two more children are led into the room. They sit quietly among the toys.</p>
      <p>Glory Herbert says their father died two days after the tsunami, he had so much sand in his lungs. There are four children in the family, and the mother can't cope. So she asked a neighbour to bring the two youngest to the orphanage. "Will she come and visit them?" I ask. Glory shakes her head. "Probably not. When they drop them off, they more or less forget about them."</p>
      <p>And what can be done for their trauma? The tsunami was only a few weeks ago. Glory Herbert says the important thing is to remove them from their villages: "The beach represents fear to them." But for the children of fishermen, who had no boundaries and little discipline, life in an institutionalised government orphanage is not easy. They miss the freedom, the relationships with other villagers. They yearn to go home. "It's always the same," says Thomas George. "The older ones beg to return to their village. To an aunt, a grandparent." He sighs. "We try. But their relatives don't want them."</p>
      <p>Glory Herbert is more concerned about how the tsunami will affect the social fabric of the villages. The economy will be restored because the boats will go back in the water. But the fear is different. "For people who earn their living from the sea, this is disaster. It was their life. Now they feel the sea has opened up and taken them."</p>
      <p>After December 26, most of the villagers went to live in shelters. But slowly they returned home, and some sense of normalcy was restored. By mid January, schools were operating. Because storytelling is a part of their culture, Glory Herbert is planning grief counselling with stories and games for the children: a way of them expressing their sorrow. "But how much will it take away the pain?"</p>
      <p>By the spring, the children are settling in. Vijitha and Vijyashree, having stubbornly decided they would return to their village, have managed to persuade their father they will be better off being cared for by relatives.</p>
      <p>They did not last long at the orphanage. The eldest sister is full of rage, so much so that she tells a social worker, Leela Krishnan, that if someone marries her father and takes her mother's place, she will kill her. It doesn't have the intended effect. Three months after the tsunami, a 17-year-old bride was found for their father. But the girls were so upset that he agreed to find an older bride, and to wait.</p>
      <p>"I kept telling Vijitha the tsunami only happened once; it won't happen for another 100 years," says Stella Magdalene, the village teacher. "But she doesn't believe me. She needs constant attention, or she begins to complain about ailments - chest pains or headaches."</p>
      <p>THALANGUDA, TAMIL NADU, INDIA</p>
      <p>NOVEMBER, 2005</p>
      <p>The boats are back in the water. At the village school, the pupils have notebooks imprinted with the words "Tsunami Relief". There's a sign at the entrance of the village that it is being supported by Comic Relief UK and the Railway Children UK. There is more money than when I was here in January. There is a bulldozer digging a well; a kiosk selling sweets and bread. For the two sisters, who lost their mother and younger brother, there's a little progress.</p>
      <p>Stella Magdalene says that Vijyashree, the younger sister, seems in better shape, but that Vijitha, the older girl, keeps looking at family photographs. "She seems not to understand what has happened. She talks about how her mother dressed her for school. Her aunt, who is taking care of her, tells her to dress herself." Vijitha constantly asks for books about the ocean. "When we took a trip to the library, she marched up and asked for a tsunami book."</p>
      <p>Later, the girls take me to their new home. It's the house built with their mother and brother's compensation money. They bound upstairs and show off the picture of their mother on a shelf.</p>
      <p>An aunt called Shanti comes to help them wash and dress. She seems competent, if slightly cold. "They're a lot of work," she complains. Shanti says the little sister does not express herself, but both girls still have nightmares: "Maybe they would be better in the orphanage." At the word "orphanage", the girls grow rigid.</p>
      <p>In a few weeks' time, their father will marry again. It will be exactly one year since their mother and brother were swallowed up by the sea. The girls cried and protested; but the village insisted. One woman even slapped Vijitha when she said she did not want her father to take a new wife.</p>
      <p>A few miles away, the orphanage has also changed. The children have been moved to a bigger space. There are yoga classes and field trips. A teacher sits tracing drawings with a group of girls.</p>
      <p>The brother and sister, Parthibhan and Anitha, are taller. The terror is gone from their eyes, and I notice that Anitha sits in a circle of smaller children, away from her brother. But her eyes dart over to where he sits often.</p>
      <p>The orphanage supervisor tells me they have no nightmares, and are behaving. But no one comes to visit them. Their grandmother is blind and can't make the journey. "They used to talk about their mother and father,"</p>
      <p>adds a teacher. "But no more." At the Government Orphanage School the children attend, I find Parthiban's teacher. She tells me that at first, Parthibhan was withdrawn. "Now, he is a good student. He is always smiling."</p>
      <p>Abinhaya, the baby found on a balcony, is walking and laughing. She is still adored by the staff. Her father married again and only came once to see her. Her grandmother comes once a week. If Freud is wrong and early childhood trauma does not affect us for ever, then she should be all right.</p>
      <p>Except she will emerge, aged 18, from an orphanage into a society that will probably not accept her.</p>
      <p>The five sisters are brought forward. Also taller. There are giggles. They are more spirited than the others. Siripriya begins to tell me the story of her mother's spirit again. Her teacher, Girija, says later, "She is difficult." Apparently, she cannot control her anger. "All of them are very emotional," Girija says. "They shout a lot."</p>
      <p>The atmosphere appears friendly, loud. But what is missing, as in all orphanages, is physical attention. There's no way six helpers can caress or cajole the 45 children the way their parents did, no matter how busy they were. "Tsunami kids yearn for comfort," says Girija. "They're always climbing in our laps." "They are not happy children," says Glory Herbert.</p>
      <p>"In their hearts they are not complete."</p>
      <p>One year after the tsunami, 65,000 people in this part of India still live in shelters. More than 500 children exist without parents. Life is very different from how it was a year ago. In Thalanguda, the teachers' goal is to get the children to go back to the beach without fear. The games they play have an ulterior motive, to end up getting closer to the water. Others worry village life has changed for ever. "The tsunami and its aftermath have created competitiveness and division," says Saji Thomas from Unicef.</p>
      <p>"People see what others are getting. Before, they lived in one small world.</p>
      <p>Now they see the bigger world."</p>
      <p>The anxiety continues. Sometimes, the villagers sleep outside their huts, ready to run if the wave comes back. Stella Magdalene says when the moon is full, a few hundred people leave the village altogether and sleep inland, with relatives.</p>
      <p>For the orphans, there is a sense that the sea took something from them.</p>
      <p>And fear that anything can happen. Vijitha won't go near the beach. "The big wave came and everything went away," she says. "How do we know it will never come back?"</p>

      <title>David Rendel</title>
      <subtitle>Boat Race winner who took the Newbury by-election for the Liberal Democrats in 1993 with a record majority</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The morning after David Rendel won the Newbury by-election in May 1993 he was walking through the town centre with Paddy Ashdown when a small boy bounded up to the high profile Liberal Democrat leader and asked: "Are you David Rendel?" The by-election, which was caused by the unexpected death of the sitting MP, Judith Chaplin, was the first since John Major and the Conservatives had won the 1992 general election. It had taken on a highly charged flavour when, at a press conference, Norman Lamont was questioned about Britain's ejection from the European exchange-rate mechanism the previous September, and infamously declared: "Je ne regrette rien."</p>
      <p>Within days both Lamont and Major had much to regret, as the Tories suffered one of their worst defeats.</p>
      <p>If at first Rendel had appeared a slightly wooden figure, ill at ease with the national media, he soon got into his stride, particularly as Julian Davidson, his Conservative opponent, stumbled. It helped that he was a man with a passionate belief that he could make a difference through politics.</p>
      <p>His attention to detail, capacity for hard work and his strident "canvassing walk" left others struggling to keep up, even if at times he could seem a little otherworldly. On one occasion during the campaign Peter Mandelson turned up and insisted on addressing him as "Dave"; back in his car a bemused Renbypass.</p>
      <p>del turned to an aide and asked: "Who was that?" Labour polled only 1,151 votes and Rendel took the seat with a majority of 22,055, the Lib Dems' largest majority on record. After Rendel's maiden speech in the Commons, Matthew Parris described him in The Times as "a tall, trim Etonian with the sort of 1950s good looks which might have secured him part-time work modelling sweaters for knitting patterns in The Lady", adding that he "speaks with the clipped bonhomie of a Pathé newsreader". Rendel represented Newbury for 12 years, quickly acquiring a national profile thanks to the controversial Newbury Despite his support for the road, he was not afraid to meet opponents. Some environmentalists later found themselves on the same side as him when he backed Labour's ban on hunting, which was a brave move in an area where equestrian passions run high.</p>
      <p>He was quietly sceptical about Ashdown's "project" to form a closer union with Labour, but he would never have disagreed with his leader in public. During the party's leadership contest in 1999, when he came fifth out of five as Charles Kennedy stormed to victory, he declared himself willing to cut an electoral deal with the Tories. More than a decade later, in 2010, he was the only member of his party's federal executive to vote against forming a coalition, foreseeing the way in which it was likely to play out.</p>
      <p>David Digby Rendel was born in Athens in 1949, the fourth of five children. His father, Alexander, was working at the British embassy and would later be diplomatic correspondent for The Times. Rendel was proud of his lineage: his forebears included Stuart Rendel, a Welsh Liberal MP who, as one of Gladstone's patrons, was raised to the peerage as the 1st (and last) Baron Rendel. He won a scholarship to Eton, where he was captain of the school. Despite being a non-believer, he rode into chapel on a donkey during Holy Week in 1967 before taking the role of Christ in a dramatised service. After teaching in Cameroon and Uganda with Voluntary Service Overseas, he read physics and philosophy at Magdalen College, Oxford, and undertook postgraduate studies at St Cross College. In 1974, he rowed at No 3 in the winning Boat Race team, which broke the course record that had been set by Cambridge in 1948. Years later, he was chairman of the all-party parliamentary rowing group.</p>
      <p>From Oxford he joined the oil industry, working in the finance departments at Shell, British Gas and later Esso. In 1974 he married Susan Taylor, whom he met through rowing friends over dinner at Magdalen. He fought Fulham for the Liberals in the 1979 and 1983 elections, increasing the party's share of the vote, but the family moved to Newbury when he was selected as parliamentary candidate for the seat. His wife worked as a GP there and their three sons were educated locally. Mark, who followed his father to Magdalen, is employed in IT by Morgan Stanley in New York; John founded a charity, Promoting Equality in African Schools; and Andrew works in the green energy industry. Rendel loved reading to his grandchildren. In the last weeks of his life he made a recording for them of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.</p>
      <p>As soon as Rendel arrived in Newbury, he became extremely active in local affairs, but came a distant second to the Tories in the general elections of 1987 and 1992. After his victory in 1993, he served as his party's frontbench spokesman on local government and later social security, leading the rebellion against government plans to scrap benefits for single parents. When Kennedy became party leader he returned to the back benches.</p>
      <p>In 1999 his bag was stolen from the first-class carriage of a train. Finding that it contained nothing but official papers and three pairs of socks, the thieves abandoned their pickings by the line near Reading. A couple of days later after clambering through the trackside brambles to retrieve his belongings, Rendel mused: "I would love to have seen their faces when they found my socks."</p>
      <p>He held the Newbury seat in 1997 and 2001, but succumbed to the resurgent Tories in 2005 and returned to local government. Last year he stood in Somerton and Frome, where the Lib Dems had previously commanded a small majority, but was soundly beaten. Like Lamont in 1993, though for very different reasons, he was able to echo Edith Piaf's words: "Je ne regrette rien."</p>
      <p>David Rendel, politician, was born on April 15, 1949. He died of cancer on May 16, 2016, aged 67</p>
      <p>At Eton he rode into chapel on a donkey during Holy Week</p>
      <p>David Rendel held Newbury for 12 years</p>

      <title>My holiday with Geert</title>
      <subtitle>Mark Smith wanted a relaxing break in the Caribbean. Then Dutch far-right firebrand Geert Wilders turned up</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Just as the creepy kid in The Sixth Sense saw dead people, I see famous people. It's partly because I'm a magazine editor and celebrities are the stock in trade, but my friend Cat thinks it's because I'll make eye contact with pretty much anyone who comes within a 10m radius. There I'll be, pottering around doing something mundane and, kaboom, I've locked peepers with Nigel Havers or a minor member of Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>When I moved to Amsterdam to work on the local version of Time Out magazine, however, my special skill deserted me overnight. The Dutch term for a celebrity is "BN", which stands for bekende Nederlander - literally, a well-known Dutchman. Except, of course, to my inexpert eyes they weren't well known at all. I'd turn up at a film premiere and not be able to tell the BNs from the PRs. In celebrity terms, I was a snow-blind outsider.</p>
      <p>There was one bekende Nederlander, however, whose notoriety couldn't escape me. Geert Wilders is the self-styled outsider politician whose caustic anti-immigrant rhetoric and architecturally improbable shock of blond hair predates Donald Trump's shtick by years. For all his man-in-thestreet grandstanding (he was convicted of inciting discrimination for leading supporters in a chant demanding "Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!" Moroccans in the Netherlands) you're extremely unlikely to see Wilders on an actual street, except for on Amsterdam protest art or grinning wonkily from the campaign posters for the PVV, his one-man Party for Freedom.</p>
      <p>That's because Wilders lives in hiding, shuttling between secret safe houses in an armoured BMW. His autobiography - a 286-page rallying cry against the Islamisation of Europe - is called Marked for Death and, unusually for Wilders, the title at least doesn't appear to be some flight of narcissistic fancy. He features on the al-Qaeda death list, and two of his ideological forebears, the politician Pim Fortuyn and the film-maker Theo Van Gogh, were assassinated for their views in 2002 and 2004 respectively. Ironically for a populist who wants to topple the profligate ivory tower of the EU (immediate "Nexit" is one of the promises on the PVV's sparse one-page manifesto), Wilders lives in the ultimate self-blown bubble at a cost of undisclosed millions to the Dutch taxpayer.</p>
      <p>It was January in 2012, the year of Marked for Death's publication, when my boyfriend, Greg, and I, keen to holiday like our adopted countrymen, took a trip to the Dutch Caribbean, hopping between the sleepy ABC islands: Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao. I was there to write a travel piece for Time Out Amsterdam. Wilders's name was all over the Dutch-language newspapers that I was just about getting to grips with. Having won 16 per cent of the vote in the 2010 general election, he had brokered himself a significant role in the minority coalition government of the day. Predictably, the circle couldn't hold, and Wilders crashed out of the uneasy alliance in 2012, ostensibly in disgust at the prime minister Mark Rutte's austerity policy.</p>
      <p>As I leant over the welcome desk of the Harbour Village club on Bonaire, the smallest of the ABCs, I noticed Wilders's name on the receptionist's ledger, highlighted in neon pink with "VIP" written either side of it in black marker. That must be someone's idea of a joke, I whispered to Greg as we followed the bellboy to our beachfront villa. Kim Kardashian used to check into hotels as Princess Jasmine; surely it's not unthinkable that her Dutch equivalent would use the name Geert Wilders. That, or the jet lag was causing me to hallucinate.</p>
      <p>Our first evening on Bonaire was spent toasting our good fortune. This was carnival time - peak tourist season - yet the resort was strangely underpopulated. The only guests we'd seen since unpacking had been all of a type: muscled thirtyish men promenading à deux in preppy clothing that was out of step with the sweltering heat. Had we stumbled across some kind of A-gay retreat? Should we have packed pleated chinos?</p>
      <p>The answers would be served with breakfast. I'd taken approximately three steps inside the restaurant before I spotted the Mozartian quiff, unmistakeable even from behind, of the man nicknamed Captain Peroxide. Wilders was seated at a table at the end of the jetty with his wife of ten years, Krisztina, a former diplomat whose excellent people skills were immediately apparent. Amid peals of laughter, she appeared to be feeding Geert a croissant.</p>
      <p>My blood chilled as my brain struggled to compute the possible implications of this surreal scenario. Here we were, about to eat eggs benedict within spitting distance of a man who had gleefully proposed a "head rag tax" (his words) on hijab-wearing Muslim women in the Netherlands. Not only that, I had recently finished Platform, the notorious Michel Houellebecq novel that culminates in an Islamic terror attack on an ungodly beach resort in southeast Asia. Surely it wasn't entirely over the top of me to fear that our holiday might take a hideous turn for the worse? Naturally I fished the iPhone from the pocket of my swim shorts and - under cover of taking a snap of my beloved - attempted a wide shot of the restaurant, Geert and Krisztina included.</p>
      <p>The image was hopelessly blurred, but I wouldn't try a second time. From the ship's stern there darted a pair of the aforementioned fancy men, visibly bristling at my antics. They were part of Wilders's security detail. The iPhone went back in my pocket and stayed there for the rest of the day, much of which I spent on the hotel's private beach, watching furtively from my sunlounger as Geert and Krisztina - who ordinarily see each other only once a week on account of all the precautions - snorkelled, snogged and rolled around in the surf, apparently trying to recreate the iconic bit of From Here to Eternity.</p>
      <p>Physically, it's fair to say they are quite far removed from Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr. Wilders, 53, is a slip of a man; his buxom wife, as a Dutch friend of mine has since unkindly put it, is more of a sturgeon than a whitebait. All the while, the security flotilla bobbed about between palm trees. I did not make enormous incursions into my holiday novel.</p>
      <p>Later, back in the villa, I penned a note on hotel paper with the intention of leaving it at reception for Wilders. I respected his right not to be pestered on holiday, I wrote, but would he consider meeting up in the Netherlands for an interview with Amsterdam's foremost listings bible? Shamed by the sheer lunacy of the request, I tore it up, but not before an argument with Greg about why I'd spent a sizeable portion of our first big trip away together obsessing over an indefensible demagogue with a bad dye job.</p>
      <p>In pop-cultural terms, my weekend with Wilders may not rival, say, My Week With Marilyn, but it certainly gifted me a handy dinner party anecdote. It also gave me an insight into the despicable allure of a peroxide peacock in a political landscape whose hallmarks to date have been calm collaboration, faltering tolerance and grey suiting. By all accounts, Wilders's party will win the single biggest share of the national vote when the Dutch take to the polls on Wednesday, but he's highly unlikely to be part of any new coalition, having already been expressly boycotted by all the other main players. For the time being, the blond bombshell will remain undetonated. I've a feeling that's just the way he likes it.

      <title>Is there a more liberal side to the Vatican enforcer?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>"This is bad news. There will be a rebellion," declared one well-informed insider.</p>
      <p>"Goodness me," exclaimed another.</p>
      <p>It is hard to see how the hand of God could have guided the 115 cardinals to elect a former member -albeit involuntary -of the Hitler Youth who believes homosexuality to be an intrinsic moral evil, other religions to be defective and other churches -including the Church of England -not proper.</p>
      <p>Nor is he simply a transitional pope. Joseph Ratzinger, who is 78, is in excellent health.</p>
      <p>Many of the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics, particularly those in Latin American countries such as Brazil, will be dismayed by this unimaginative choice.</p>
      <p>They will see it as divisive and lacking in courage.</p>
      <p>They regard him as a man who will continue the conservative, ultra-orthodox legacy of John Paul II, but who apparently possesses none of his charm, charisma or ability to reach out to the young.</p>
      <p>His role as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the Inquisition, has not endeared him to priests, bishops and cardinals who have had the courage to step out of line even on minor issues. Some have been sharply disciplined. Catholics can expect no change in the Vatican's ban on condoms, even in combating the Aids pandemic in the developing world.</p>
      <p>Married priests will not be introduced during his papacy. The idea of women priests is a non-starter.</p>
      <p>The first response from commentators within the British Church is that this is a "safe" choice, someone who will continue to resist modernist tendencies in the Church and who will enforce a strict line against any deviation from doctrine and tradition.</p>
      <p>But there could be another side to Pope Benedict XVI. His choice of name indicates that he may focus on one particular aspect of his predecessor's activities his antiwar stance.</p>
      <p>Benedict XV worked strenuously for peace during the First World War as Pope John Paul II did with little success before and during the Iraq war. It could be that the new Pope will bring a new advocacy to that mission.</p>
      <p>It is often the case, in large organisations, that those who aspire to the top job have to adopt certain practices and behaviours. Cardinal Ratzinger certainly showed himself eminently skilled at ecclesiastical politics during the last few days and months, if not years.</p>
      <p>Popes can turn out better as well as worse than expected, and now he has won the papacy, a more charismatic and sympathetic priest may emerge from behind that stern exterior.</p>
      <p>After all, as a young man he had a reputation as something of a liberal, and although it is frequently mentioned that he was briefly a member of the Hitler Youth, we must not forget that membership in wartime Germany was compulsory.</p>
      <p>Indeed, his family was opposed to the Nazis. Maybe his progressive radicalism will re-emerge now he is in Pope.</p>
      <p>In 1963 Cardinal Ratzinger wrote the famous speech for Cardinal Frings, Archbishop of Cologne, which denounced the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith as a "cause of scandal to the world" because of its antiquated methods. As a result, Paul VI instructed the Vatican's doctrinal enforcers to reverse their priorities and encourage good theology rather than crack down on the bad.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Ratzinger has been hard on theologians, and the traditional bond between theologians and bishops has been seriously damaged. He is so closely associated with the papacy of John Paul II and its centralising tendencies that it is hard to see how he can lead the healing process now required -but perhaps he was simply following the Pope's lead.</p>
      <p>It is also conceivable, seeing the way that the white smoke was blowing, that Cardinal Ratzinger simply adopted the persona of a ruthless conservative in order to rise to the top, and will now use his new power and freedom to usher in an era of enlightenment.</p>
      <p>Then again, maybe not. After all, is the Pope a Catholic?</p>

      <title>A lesson in the art of spin</title>

    <text>
      <p>Civic Type-R has such performance that Honda is offering owners driving lessons</p>
      <p>WHEN you next go along to order a new car, you may expect a few freebies. You might, for example, be offered free servicing or low-cost insurance. If you are really lucky, you might also be tempted by a year's free road-fund licence. However, not many manufacturers have offered free driving instruction, something that every prospective purchaser of Honda's new high-performance Civic Type-R will be able to enjoy when the car goes on sale in October.</p>
      <p>No offence is intended, of course. Honda does not mean to imply any disrespect in relation to its customers' driving skills, but the Type-R is a cut above the average hot hatch, equipped as it is with Honda's latest 200bhp, 2.0-litre i-VTEC engine. With a top speed of 146mph, it encourages enthusiastic driving and therefore one-to-one training by former police drivers on safer driving techniques is included.</p>
      <p>"The course is known as MAC (motorcycle appreciation course) and was devised just over three years ago," Bob McMillan, the general manager of Honda racing, MAC and business development, said. "It was offered free for Honda bikers buying a machine of 600cc or more. The scheme won the Prince Michael award for safety in its first year and more than 15,000 people have benefited from it."</p>
      <p>The Type-R buyer will be offered the services of an instructor in the same way. "The content," McMillan said, "can be flexible, depending on the customer. It can cover use of speed, gears and brakes, linked to advanced observation and positioning."</p>
      <p>And there is little doubt that owners will enjoy "use of speed" when it comes to driving the Type-R. The 2.0-litre engine is a masterpiece, arguably one of the finest high- performance four-cylinder engines that money can buy. Its ingenious i-VTEC valve-train is an evolution of plain VTEC which, put simply, lets you have your cake and eat it. It allows the engine to howl its way to nearly 8,000rpm like the most temperamental of racing engines when you are in the mood, but it retains the flexibility of a normal family car when you are not.</p>
      <p>A new six-speed close-ratio gearbox makes the most of the engine's performance and, like the normal Civic three-door, its lever is mounted on the dash. Other changes include a lower ride height, uprated suspension, fat tyres on 17-inch wheels and revised spoilers.</p>
      <p>It certainly looks the part, achieving the metamorphosis from benign family hatch to snorting beast quite successfully. That is an important part of the Type-R's persona, Stephen Hollings, the head of marketing for Honda UK, believes, because this particular model is intended to fulfil a vital public relations role for the company. Apparently, Honda cars still have an image problem in the UK, firmly rooted in blue-rinse territory.</p>
      <p>"We want to use this car to change the image of Honda," Hollings said. "We're frustrated, to be honest. Some people take a view of Honda that we don't think we deserve."</p>
      <p>Despite delivering a range of honest but technically advanced family cars, topped with a smattering of high-performance derivatives such as the Integra and Accord Type- R and S2000 sports car, the public still perceives the Honda brand as one typically chosen by a sensible older buyer.</p>
      <p>And, although Honda does not want to lose its mature customers, it also wants to create a more youthful persona for some of its products, too; hence the Civic Type-R.</p>
      <p>The really good news is this. Hollings believes that getting cars out on to the streets is a more effective way to achieve his goal than advertising. "We will advertise," he said, "but we won't spend much."</p>
      <p>The secret weapon will be the price. When the Type-R was unveiled at this year's Geneva Motor Show, a price of about Pounds 20,000 was on the cards, similar to that of the Ford RS Focus scheduled for launch at the end of this year. But Honda has executed a perfect U-turn and slashed the price of the Type-R to Pounds 15,995, in order, Hollings said, "to get more people on the road and change the public's view of the Honda brand".</p>
      <p>There is only one choice of interior trim, in black and grey with a scattering of red stitching and metal-effect plastic on the dash. Regulation hot-hatch cream dials and alloy gearknob finish the package. The seats are thankfully extremely supportive, but the Civic's driving position is not the best for tall types, thanks to a steering column that is adjustable only for height, not reach.</p>
      <p>However, that is soon forgiven once the Type-R reveals its blistering performance and balanced handling. There is some tugging at the steering wheel owing to so much power being transmitted through the front wheels, but not excessive amounts. And, given the opportunity to take this nimble Civic off-road to a closed track, the car demonstrated a near racing car level of ability.</p>
      <p>Indeed, there are plans afoot to race the Type-R in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC). Its prospects are being evaluated by a BTCC preparation specialist but, McMillan said, "we are assessing its potential to win outright. If you can see a car leading a race, the cost is worthwhile."</p>
      <p>The 1,500 to 2,000 recipients of the Type-R in the UK each year should also gain satisfaction from the fact that the Honda is not only one of the most powerful in its class, it is also the cheapest. Unlike the Ford, it is British built, the modified body-shell sharing the same Swindon production line with common-or-garden three-door Civics. All are exported to the United States and Japan.</p>
      <p>The Type-R should vanish from Honda showrooms like bags of corn at a pigeon fanciers' conference. When it does so, Honda will send a clear commercial message to other manufacturers of overpriced premium hatchbacks: be afraid, be very afraid.</p>

      <title>Terry's brainlessness ends up damaging no one but himself</title>
      <subtitle>The Chelsea captain's serial stupidity denies him the chance of Champions League redemption next month in Munich, says Matt Hughes in Barcelona</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A needless, senseless capacity for self-destruction has been a recurring theme throughout John Terry's turbulent career, but rarely on the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea captain has endured enough scrapes and scandals to keep several ailing newspapers afloat singlehandedly, although at work he has generally exuded an unflappable air of calm.</p>
      <p>Terry's lengthy rap sheet reads like an A to Z of the possible misdemeanours of the serially stupid, but in a strange way last night's error of judgment will hurt him more than the all the others, as even he struggled to justify it. The beauty of Chelsea's remarkable defensive triumph, however, is that the only person to suffer as a consequence will be Terry himself when he is forced to sit out next month's final through suspension.</p>
      <p>While clearly impossible to get inside Terry's head and analyse his thought processes it is mildly diverting and potentially enlightening to try.</p>
      <p>Parking in a disabled bay? No-one uses them anyway. A quick tour of Chelsea's training ground? What's the harm? Letting down his wife? It didn't mean anything, honest love. Letting down his team-mates? Nah, definitely not, I'd never do a thing like that.</p>
      <p>The football field has always been Terry's haven from the chaos of his personal life that began with a difficult upbringing, which makes his actions in deliberately kneeing Alexis Sánchez in the back in the 37th minute as they jostled on the edge of the penalty area all the more inexplicable. What was he thinking? Did he not notice the presence of referee Cüneyt Çakir a few yards away? After all he has been through, including losing the England captaincy on two occasions and a looming criminal trial for allegedly racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, does Terry still believe he can get away with anything?</p>
      <p>Terry claimed in a television interview conducted immediately after leaving the pitch that he accidentally kneed Sánchez from behind, and his remaining supporters will hope for his sake that he has a more credible action for his behaviour when he appears at West London Magistrates' Court in July. As a disbelieving Jamie Redknapp put it on television: "At this level of football I don't think I have ever seen anything as stupid. It's the most unbelievable thing I've seen in my life."</p>
      <p>Terry has been sent off before, of course, but not for perpetrating seemingly random acts of mindless violence. Indeed, a career tally of five red cards is actually relatively modest for a centre back who has made 543 appearances for his club, particularly given the way he plays the game.</p>
      <p>Given the number of desperate, lastditch tackles he has made over the last decade - and the obvious potential for them to be mistimed - it is surprising that he has not been dismissed more often.</p>
      <p>All of which added to the general feeling of bafflement, particularly in the circumstances, as Redknapp and Graeme Souness went on to articulate with a sense of incredulity. Souness called on Terry to apologise to all of his teammates and every single Chelsea fan, but in the event a heartfelt thank you should suffice.</p>
      <p>For all his faults Terry has always been an inspirational leader on the pitch, with Fabio Capello's belief in his captain so strong that he allowed it to cause his resignation as England manager, but when his side needed him most he was guilty of a total abrogation of responsibility. The 30-year-old has been playing through the pain caused by two cracked ribs for several weeks and may have sensed his Champions League dream was dying as Barcelona pushed forward in search of a second goal, although such matters do not usually bother him. Ditto the potential for distraction caused by Sunday's unwanted reunion with Ferdinand and Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Terry's moment of madness, or temporary outbreak of Zidaneness, could not have come at a worse time, but perhaps even more inexplicable was the fact that despite suffering an immediate setback it did not cost his side a place in the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Chelsea had already lost Gary Cahill to a hamstring injury 11 minutes earlier and a goal which took Barcelona level on aggregate when Sergio Busquets tapped in Isaac Cuenca's cross in the previous minute, and desperately needed the rejigged centre-back pairing of Terry and Branislav Ivanovic to steer them through to half-time. Instead Barcelona appeared to have taken control of the tie. Andrés Iniesta scored a minute before the interval, but Ramires' brilliant chip in first half stoppage time changed everything.</p>
      <p>Terry being Terry was involved in the half-time team-talk when he exhorted his team-mates to continue to believe in miracles, and they responded by drawing upon all their experience to summon the spirit of the Spartans at Thermopylae and fight on, regardless of being outnumbered and outgunned.</p>
      <p>Unlike the Spartans they won. Under Roberto Di Matteo Chelsea's battle-scared warriors have turned the heroic last stand into a bona fide tactic, and this was their Rorke's Drift.</p>
      <p>The irony, of course, is that Terry would usually have been the last man standing, but on this occasion they did not need him. Di Matteo would like to call on him in next month's final in Munich, but not as much as Terry would love to atone for his missed penalty in Moscow four years ago. The denial of his redemptive storyline is a suitable punishment for his stupidity.</p>

      <p>How Barcelona rated 3-4-3</p>
      <p>Average rating 7.2</p>
      <p>6 Victor Valdés</p>
      <p>A spectator throughout, just as he was at Stamford Bridge - his only contribution forcing Gerard Piqué's substitution - before being beaten by a quite beautiful sucker punch.</p>
      <p>7 Javier Mascherano</p>
      <p>A game that bridged the two roles of the Argentine's career: nominally a central defender, but spent most of his time in territory he would have known well as a central midfield player.</p>
      <p>7 Gerard Piqué</p>
      <p>Restored after missing the first leg amid reports of tensions with Pep Guardiola, the central defender lasted just 25 minutes, substituted after being clattered by Víctor Valdés.</p>
      <p>7 Carles Puyol</p>
      <p>The only pure defender on the pitch after Gerard Piqué's enforced removal, the captain looked uncomfortable on the left of a three-man defence. Caught out for Ramires's goal.</p>
      <p>6 Cesc Fàbregas</p>
      <p>Dropped for the defeat by Real Madrid, Fàbregas did little to justify his inclusion here. His main contribution, winning a penalty early in the second half, was wasted by Messi.</p>
      <p>7 Sergio Busquets</p>
      <p>How fitting that it should have been the midfield anchorman who opened the scoring: it was Busquets, after all, who missed an open goal at the very end of the first leg.</p>
      <p>8 Xavi Hernández</p>
      <p>It is hard to judge Xavi's performances, so effortless does he make the exacting seem, but he was a picture of grace, vision and guile here, constantly pushing his side forward.</p>
      <p>8 Andrés Iniesta</p>
      <p>A wonderfully taken goal and a display of vigour and invention, particularly given that a berth wide on the left rarely seems one suited to elicit the midfield player's best form.</p>
      <p>8 Isaac Cuenca</p>
      <p>Drafted in by Pep Guardiola to circumvent Chelsea's narrow back four, he set up Sergio Busquets for the first but it was a lofted pass to Cesc Fàbregas that showed his talent.</p>
      <p>8 Lionel Messi</p>
      <p>Short of his shimmering best - missing a penalty - but still the world's finest footballer might have scored twice in the early stages before teeing up Iniesta to double Barcelona's lead.</p>
      <p>9 Alexis Sánchez</p>
      <p>It is high praise, given the calibre of his team-mates, that the Chilean was Barcelona's most potent attacking threat, his blend of pace and trickery troubling Chelsea from the off.</p>
      <p>Substitutes: Daniel Alves (for Piqué, 26min) A surprise omission as Guardiola tried to reinvigorate his team after two successive defeats, the Brazilian replaced the injured Piqué but failed to pose a threat. 6 Cristian Tello (for Cuenca, 68) A like-for-like change for his fellow La Masia graduate, the winger was thrown on in a bid to inject yet more pace into the home team. 6 Seydou Keita (for Fàbregas, 74).</p>
      <p>Not used: José Pinto, Adriano, Thiago Alcántara, Pedro Rodríguez.</p>
      <p>Booked: Iniesta, Messi.</p>
      <p>How Chelsea rated 4-5-1</p>
      <p>Average rating 6.6</p>
      <p>9 Petr CechYet again, the Czech proved his immeasurable value to this Chelsea side, producing a string of saves - from Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Isaac Cuenca - to give his team hope.</p>
      <p>8 Branislav Ivanovic</p>
      <p>The last central defender standing after John Terry's dismissal and Gary Cahill's injury, the Serb did all he could to marshal his troops in the face of Barcelona's onslaught.</p>
      <p>6 Gary Cahill</p>
      <p>The hero of Chelsea's rearguard action in the first leg at Stamford Bridge limped off after just 12 minutes, unable to continue after picking up a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>3 John Terry</p>
      <p>Whether it was stupidity or malice - or, as José Mourinho would claim, part of a conspiracy - Terry's sending-off was a betrayal when they needed him most.</p>
      <p>7 Ashley Cole</p>
      <p>The left back, 31, may not be especially likeable, but it is unfathomable, on this form, that Chelsea would look to offload him in the summer, regardless of his age.</p>
      <p>5 Juan Mata</p>
      <p>Chelsea's most creative player is included on such occasions more in hope than expectation. Such a defensive system, in which he is deployed on the right, renders him irrelevant.</p>
      <p>6 Frank Lampard</p>
      <p>A wonderful pass for Ramires's goal and a performance of considerable diligence, refusing to be bewitched by Barcelona's passing and holding his ground well.</p>
      <p>7 John Obi Mikel</p>
      <p>Much maligned for much of the season, the Nigerian coped well when drafted into a central defensive role. In many ways, he seems more comfortable there than in midfield.</p>
      <p>7 Raul Meireles</p>
      <p>In sharp contrast to Juan Mata, the Portuguese's energy guarantees him a crucial role in this system: he is designated by Roberto Di Matteo to press the ball, a task he performs well.</p>
      <p>Ramires 8 A bittersweet evening, getting booked for dissent immediately after Barcelona's second goal before producing the sort of finish Lionel Messi would be proud of to earn the first goal.</p>
      <p>8 Didier Drogba</p>
      <p>The Ivorian's presence seems to be Barcelona's Kryptonite. Carried what little threat Chelsea posed in the first half on his own and was superb as a full back in the second.</p>
      <p>Substitutes: José Bosingwa (for Cahill, 12min) Playing as an auxiliary centre back for the second half, the Portuguese, not exactly a popular figure with Chelsea's supporters, carried out his duties well. 7 Salomon Kalou (for Mata, 58) Replaced the ineffective Spain midfield player and produced a disciplined display in defence. 6 Fernando Torres (for Drogba, 80).</p>
      <p>Not used: Ross Turnbull, Michael Essien, Florent Malouda, Daniel Sturridge.</p>
      <p>Booked: Cech, Ivanovic, Ramires, Lampard, Mikel, Meireles. Sent off: Terry.</p>
      <p>Referee: Cüneyt Çakir (Turkey).</p>
      <p>Red missed: Terry seems surprised as Çakir, the referee, sends him off for kneeing Sánchez in the back in an off-the-ball incident. The Chelsea captain will now have to watch his team-mates from the stands in the final in Munich next month</p>

      <title>After Thanksgiving, will it be the black day in the malls that retailers long for?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Another week, another instalment of Sub-Prime! -the reality show in which viewers get to guess which bank is going to be the next to shock us with revelations about the scale of its financial insobriety back in those heady days of easy money and disappearing risk premiums.</p>
      <p>Actually, yesterday's big news didn't really represent a new instalment in the long-running series, more like one of those what's-happened-so-far clarifications that you sometimes get at the start of a new episode.</p>
      <p>The travails of Citigroup, America's largest bank, were already well known $10 billion (£ 4.8 billion) in losses on asset-backed securities; one chief executive ousted -but yesterday it was hit again when Goldman Sachs upgraded its estimates for the bank's total likely losses from the debacle to $15 billion and downgraded the company's stock recommendation from "hold" to "sell". Given the rarity of a "sell" recommendation on Wall Street, even in those days of greater enforced transparency, it means something like: "Run, do not walk, to your broker and get every last penny you can out of this dog of a company while you still can."</p>
      <p>I thought Goldman Sachs did a pretty good job of disguising the schadenfreude in their rather stony observations about their less fortunate banking brethren.</p>
      <p>Goldman, of course, has reason to strut a bit, since it seems that, unlike those oiks at other institutions, its managers managed to exit the gadarene rush into CDOs and the like just before the cliff's edge.</p>
      <p>But we can be certain there will be more instalments of the sub-prime saga and who knows who may yet be exposed? As grim as it all seems, the really important question for investors in America and elsewhere remains: how does all this affect the great American consumer? We may get answers in the next few days.</p>
      <p>Thursday is Thanksgiving Day, when the nation actually stops spending for a few hours and gives thanks for its many blessings.</p>
      <p>In recompense for this unconscionable lapse and inexplicable misplacing of national priorities, the country goes completely crazy the next day and kicks off the Christmas shopping season in a frenzy of retail activity.</p>
      <p>It is known in the trade as Black Friday. The name is not a reference to the colour of turkey stuffing after it has been left on the table too long; it reflects, instead, the fact that this is traditionally the biggest day for retail spending of the entire year as everyone gets off to an early start (by my standards) in their Christmas shopping duties. And so, for most retailers, it is the day that their annual accounts can be relied on to go into the black.</p>
      <p>It is, thus, I believe, the only national holiday that I know of anywhere in the world whose popular name derives from the terminology of accountancy. (Please readers, spare me the e-mails telling me I have forgotten about Singapore's Double-Entry Thursday, or Estonia's Accruals-Basis Tuesday.) This year the stakes on said Friday are higher than ever and retailers are leaving nothing to chance in an effort to maximise their sales.</p>
      <p>JC Penney, one of the largest department stores, has announced that many of its shops will open at 4am on Friday. If you're afraid you might sleep in, the retailers will even arrange a wake-up call for you on your mobile phone so that you can get in line early enough to pick up that heavily discounted 86in high-definition TV.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on the numbers that the retailers report after this weekend. Any sign of the long-awaited retreat by consumers will be taken as sure evidence that the bottom is about to fall out of the US economy. Consumption expenditures after all, account for 70 per cent of US economic activity and, as I have noted before, there has not been a real consumer recession in America since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>Will this Christmas season be the time that record comes to an end?</p>
      <p>The credit crunch seems to be having as yet only limited impact on spending. The vast majority of Americans, in fact, still have access to fairly easy money. The Federal Reserve's reductions in interest rates have actually significantly lowered the cost of much consumer borrowing.</p>
      <p>Incomes have been rising steadily, and, as grim as the equity market tumble may have been recently, anyone invested in the stock market (and, thanks to highly visible pension accounts in America, that means just about everybody) knows that their stock wealth has increased since last Christmas by 5 per cent or more.</p>
      <p>Housing, of course, is different. If the value of your house falls, do you trim your spending because you feel less wealthy?</p>
      <p>We are now in uncharted territory. There has not been a sustained fall in American house prices since the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>But even if we are in the midst of one now, will it really hurt spending? The latest figures from the Federal Reserve show that the total aggregate value of real estate held by the personal sector increased from $12.5 trillion in 2001 to $21 trillion in the middle of this year, a staggering 70 per cent increase in wealth in just six years.</p>
      <p>My guess is that the price of your house would have to fall a fair bit before you decided to get seriously stingy with the Christmas presents.</p>

      <author>Robert Elms; Body; Andalusia, once the glittering caliphate of Al Andalus, the deep south of Europe, has long exerted an almost hypnotic pull over me. We've had a house high in the old Moorish redoubt of Vejer de la Frontera for more than a decade, and every summer my family are dragged on yet another trawl around charismatic white towns beneath unforgiving blue skies.; I've come to realise that most great Andalusian cities have a smaller twin town amid arid, undulating countryside only a few kilometres away. We ventured out to some of these unsung satellite towns and discovered three of the most remarkable little places in the south.; Leave Seville, head for Carmona Seville should be the starting point of any journey into Andalusia. The ravishing, operatic capital of the region is a highstepping, foot-stomping fiesta of a city; a swaggering, sensual experience. But if you want a more tranquil introduction to Andalusian style, turn right instead of left when you emerge from the airport and in far less time than it takes to get to La Giralda, you'll be taking tapas in a fragrant plaza and admiring elaborate Mudéjar architecture, with no crowds and no tourist tat. Carmona, 20 miles from the centre of Seville, is a perfect replica in miniature.; Although its origins are Roman, Carmona was largely fashioned in the 16th and 17th centuries by aristocratic Sevillano families who wanted more room to build grand palaces to accommodate the booty theyhadplundered from theAmericas.So it has an abundance of elaborate monuments, imposing churches and ornate plazas.; You must visit the Parador, which sits inside a ruined fortress on a high escarpment, to see the wondrous views over the plain, with its numerous olive trees. But stay in the imposing Casa de Carmona, which is still home to the noble family who built it, and among the most atmospheric hotels that you will ever experience.; Gracious and spacious, rambling and crumbling, it is eccentric in the extreme and lacking in some of the modern amenities that we take for granted.; But it is redeemed by its breathtaking architectural beauty and its charming owners.; Don Felipe, a man of impeccable manners in many languages, will serve orange juice freshly squeezed by his wife in the lovely conservatory, while gently regaling you with tales of his efforts to preserve this glorious pile in such straitened times. Just don't tell him that his rates are scandalously low for such a priceless experience.; Leave Jerez, head for Sanlúcar de Barrameda Jerez is fine if you're into flamenco - or horses. If not, it can feel strangely subdued. You might want to bypass this stately but somnolent town and head to Sanlúcar de Barrameda.; The road to Sanlúcar, less than 30 minutes away, passes through themostremarkable terrain of blanched hills, crested with elegant white farmhouses and blessed with rows of vines. This is sherry country, but as we approach the sea, the salty air changes the flavour of the wine to make Manzanilla, the crisp, dry variety that can be produced only in Sanlúcar.; We have shadowed the route of the mighty Guadalquivir River from Seville and this is where it meets the sea. The ramshackle but vivacious estuary town features aristocratic mansions and fishermen's huts-turned-restaurants; and it is splendidly named - Bajo de Guía, which literally means "bottom of the map".; Sanlúcar is as far as you can go. It has that dreamy "end of the road" feel, and a hazy shimmering light that bathes everything with its glow. It could, of course, be the wine, or the wonderful seafood, but it feels like a perpetually happy place. Unkempt, windblown and so thoroughly Spanish that there are no concessions made for foreigners - and few seem to visit. It's a place for those who like their Andalusia rough and real. I like more than just about anywhere else in the world.; Here you can stay in a palace, the elegant Posada del Palacio, eat in great restaurants, or sit on the beach or in lively squares. In August you may encounter the annual horse races. Jerez has equine thoroughbreds, but in Sanlúcar it is more a case of noisy gallops along the beach, where children set up impromptu betting offices and gamble with sweets. Even if the horses aren't running, there is a good chance of a ride on the beach as the sun sets.; Leave Cádiz, head for El Puerto de Santa María Cádiz is a terrific town, a working port that is historic and interesting, but if pleasure is your purpose, look across the bay to El Puerto de Santa María. This is where locals come to play, and you could get the ferry across or drive through the eerie salt marshes to join them. El Puerto, originally an important port in its own right - it was from here that Columbus set off to discover the New World - is now as close as Andalusia gets to a seaside resort; a lovely, jolly town, frayed at the edges, but handsome still and imbued with a great sense of fun.; There are good beaches just outside the centre, but the real attractions are along the pretty palm-lined estuary - a park, a little funfair and scores of outdoor eateries where you munch on crustacea while drinking yet more of the local sherry. The real attraction is just wandering along the promenades and people-watching. If you want to stay, the best option is a former monastery, Hotel Monasterio San Miguel, right in the centre of town. It has a lovely garden with a pool and a clientele that includes the King of Spain himself.; It's always worth veering off the main road away from the big cities, because their smaller counterparts are just as wonderful.; Need to know Stay Carmona Casa de Carmona. Doubles from •¤65 (0034 954 191 000, casadecarmona.com) Sanlúcar Posada de Palacio, right.; Doubles from ¤72 (0034 956 365 060, posadadepalacio.com) Santa María Hotel Monasterio San Miguel B&amp;B doubles from ¤76pp (0034 956 540 440, monasteriosanmiguel hotel.net) All prices are low season.

    <text>
      <p>There are few laughs on the campaign trail with Michael Howard, but then he's deadly serious that his is the voice of political reason. So, asks Robert Crampton, are we thinking what he's thinking?</p>
      <p>Michael Howard doesn't like Tony Blair. That may seem axiomatic, but, contrary to appearances, leading politicians in opposing parties more often than not get along fine, united both by their joint membership of an elite and a shared hostility to their own party rivals, activists and backbenchers and the media. If they do harbour animosities, they don't usually express them in public. Howard, however, cannot hide his distaste for the man he hopes to supplant. Charles Kennedy refers to his opponents as "Tony" and "Michael". Tony Blair uses "Charles" and "Michael Howard".</p>
      <p>But Michael Howard says "Blair" (and he says it pretty contemptuously at that) or occasionally, with irony, "Mr Blair". (Charles Kennedy he doesn't mention at all.) I asked Howard what he thought of the Prime Minister as a man, and he paused before saying, "I don't really see him now." Because, I say, the two of you go back a long way, don't you? (Blair and Howard, and indeed Kennedy, entered the Commons at the same election, 1983, and Blair shadowed Howard both when Howard was Employment Secretary and then when he was Home Secretary.) "I used to get on perfectly well with him," he says. "Now I so deeply disapprove of the way in which he has run the government that it's quite difficult for me to separate those things in my mind." But you're civil to each other when you meet? Howard purses his lips and doesn't reply. Do you meet socially at all? He shakes his head.</p>
      <p>Largely because of "Something of the Night" and Paxman's famous 12 repetitions of the same question on Newsnight (and Howard's 13 evasions), the received wisdom on Howard is that he's a slippery customer. (He may say a lot of people don't like Blair much, but the truth is a lot of people have never liked him.) I have to say he is difficult to warm to, not because he is slippery, rather because he is so relentlessly focused on rattling out his pitch that it is hard to develop any rapport. He wasn't oleaginous. If anything, he was brusque. He doesn't so much dodge questions as answer them very quickly, then give you the gimlet stare and invite the next. His crispness is such that while his conversation is free of verbosity or flourish, rarely does it take a colourful or discursive turn either. When he is required to speak more informally, you can almost hear the gears crashing. That may well be evidence of stiffness, but it isn't evidence of slipperiness. Besides, many people will sympathise with his discomfiture.</p>
      <p>A lot of people who know Howard well say his image is a travesty of the man they know, that in private he is charming and witty ("at least", as one observer puts it, "by the impoverished standards of his profession"). I didn't, by definition, see him in private, but I did spend a chunk of time with him, and I have to say I didn't see much charm or wit. A bit, but not much. I don't think he is comfortable talking to journalists about what he probably thinks are inconsequential matters. (Even in the backbiting days of the Major government, Howard was renowned in the lobby for never briefing against colleagues.) He doesn't do gossip or small talk. He doesn't do much big talk either, in the sense of expounding his broader political philosophy. What he does, like the QC he is, is stick to his brief, which is to hammer the Prime Minister as a waffler, a fake and a letdown and sell himself as a grown-up, businesslike, practical man of action.</p>
      <p>For example, I said that when I interviewed William Hague last autumn he spoke at length about Blairism as a political phenomenon. What was his, Howard's, view of Blairism? "That it's all talk, that people are getting fed up with that and what they want is action and that's what we'll do. I'm not a good actor like Mr Blair, I'm interested in getting things done." But politically Blair's staked out your ground, hasn't he? "No, I don't think he has staked out our ground at all. He's tried to deceive people into thinking that's what he's done." But on law and order, for instance, that always used to be seen as a Tory issue and one of Blair's achievements was to make it one of his issues as well? (This is pretty uncontroversial stuff, I would have thought.) "Except that in his case it's all talk," says Howard. Round and round we go.</p>
      <p>What I feel about Howard is this: it's not so much a question of not liking him for this or that reason, it's more a sense that he doesn't like you.</p>
      <p>He's courteous, but he keeps you at a distance, and there's a hint, I think, of suppressed intellectual brutality. (Maybe there's more of the high-achieving Welsh grammar school boy, wearing his very able mind like armour, left in Howard than people imagine.) With both Kennedy and Blair, they at least conveyed the impression that we were two men engaged on a common endeavour, strangers trying to get some sort of dialogue off the ground. With Howard, the atmosphere felt much more adversarial, more like a courtroom, Howard's habitat for many years. A fencing match, say, rather than an agreeable game of table tennis: one slip and (excuse the hackneyed imagery) he'll rip out your jugular, something he does to his rival on a regular basis in the Commons. (Although Howard likes table tennis, as it happens. "It's a very enjoyable game and good exercise," he says, which is what he always seems to say to interviewers about table tennis.) I'd say this feeling was my problem rather than his if he didn't have such a track record of falling out with people. It's not just Ann Widdecombe, Boris Johnson and Howard Flight, there's a long list, to which the unlikely name of George Bush has recently been added. When he stood for the leadership following John Major's resignation in 1997, Howard came bottom of the poll, with 23 votes out of 165 MPs. "Not the most pleasant experience of my life," he says. And, having first stood for election to the Commons in 1966, it took him another 16 years to secure a winnable seat. Michael Crick, Howard's recent biographer, estimates he applied to be selected in more than 40 winnable seats, often falling at the final fence.</p>
      <p>Some say anti-semitism was at play, but then Malcolm Rifkind and Howard's Cambridge contemporary Leon Brittan, both also Jewish, found seats fairly quickly. Might there not instead have been an inchoate sense among the Tory faithful that somehow they didn't measure up to this clever, unclubbable man, that he didn't need them, that he'd be better off elsewhere?</p>
      <p>His long slog is also, of course, testament to his determination. "I had pretty well reconciled myself to not getting in," he says. Similarly, having returned to the backbenches in 1999, he thought he'd "had a jolly good run" and "was not expecting to return to frontline politics". He toyed with the idea of returning to the Bar (Sandra, his wife, had wanted him to in 1997, "because he might have made a bit more money"). "I wasn't sure whether I would stand again," he says (for Parliament, in 2001). "I decided to have two years on the backbenches to decide whether I liked it, and I did." After 2001, Iain Duncan Smith asked him to be his Shadow Chancellor.</p>
      <p>"I got very fired up about the health service in my constituency and I felt if I could play a part in changing things for the better, I had a duty to do thatI this is maybe going to sound pompous but I think we're all put on this earth to use our talents to make it a better place than when we found it."</p>
      <p>So there we were in Howard's office in Tory campaign HQ in Victoria, the two of us plus Guy Black, Howard's press secretary. (No sign, sadly, of Lynton Crosby, the Australian electoral guru credited with tightening the Tories' campaigning focus.) That morning I'd accompanied Howard as he visited, cameras in tow, a traveller camp at Crays Hill near Billericay in Essex. How did he respond to the charge of opportunism? "I always think it's the most asinine riposte," he says. "If they don't think it (the growth of illegal traveller camps) is a problem then let them say that.</p>
      <p>Falconer on the radio this morning admitted it is a problem, so we're entitled to talk about it. What's their solution? Just to indulge in childish name-calling is pathetic really."</p>
      <p>Fighting an election on populist issues didn't work for Hague in 2001 though, did it? "This is a very different kind of election. Mr Blair has had his second chance and he's blown it just as he blew the first. And I'm talking about lots of other things as well." Doesn't he worry that in highlighting immigration, asylum and travellers many voters will continue to see the Tories as "the nasty party"? "Teresa (May) didn't say we were the nasty party, she said some people saw us like that. I never thought that was accurate (although) there were moments," he admits, "in the past when we weren't as closely in tune with mainstream thinking as we might have been." Given his ethnicity, and the fact that his own parents were immigrants, had he not had a moment's doubt that he was wrong to make so much of immigration? "Not at all. I meet lots of people from ethnic minorities. They share my viewI you have to have firm but fair immigration control."</p>
      <p>I ask if, again like Hague, he accepts the notion of a metropolitan liberal elite. "Yes." And this elite sets the parameters for debate, and if you step outside those parameters, by talking about traveller camps, for instance, it's seen as not quite the done thing in polite society? "I know exactly what you mean," he says. "But I don't wake up thinking, 'How can I challenge the views of the metropolitan liberal elite today?'" In days gone by, I say, the Tory party formed part of that elite and doesn't now. He disagrees. "I was engaged in constant warfare with the metropolitan liberal elite when I was Home Secretary."</p>
      <p>More broadly, I say, there's that AB category of voters, something close to a quarter of the electorate now, and they used to vote Tory and now they don't, or not enough of them do. How's he going to win them back? "By continuing to put forward reasonable solutions to problems that worry people." Why does he think the Conservatives lost their support? "Oh, we were in office for 18 years, most people thought it was time for a change, we lost our reputation for economic competence over the ERM. Take your pick." The view of the Tory modernisers, I say, a view best exemplified by Michael Portillo after 1997, the view that says "we have to change the whole way we think, the way we are, the way we talk about public services" and so forth, does he think that's a load of old flannel? "I wouldn't describe it that way because it was a view held by a lot of intelligent people whom I respect," he says, "but I don't really belong to the emblematic school of politics. I'm a practical man. For a long time people didn't see us as a credible or convincing opposition. Now they do."</p>
      <p>When he launched his candidacy for the leadership in November 2003, Howard gave a speech that, briefly, got a lot of those Tory modernisers very excited. "There can be no 'no-go' areas for a modern Conservative party," he said, code for acknowledging that the Tories should become more inclusive of minorities, be nice about the public sector, make an effort in the inner cities, that kind of thing. Despite what has looked so far like another campaign designed to excite the core vote, Howard denies he has renounced the modernisers' agenda. "I want the party to be involved in all the challenges Britain faces, but I will also talk about other subjects which may once have been regarded as taboo but which I think need to be dealt with."</p>
      <p>He also, in 2003, said: "We won't hesitate to give credit to the Government when it gets things right." What, then, I ask, has the Government got right? He cites allowing the Bank of England to set interest rates and the invasion of Iraq. He pauses. "Not much else, I think." And was there anything that he did as a minister that he now thinks, "I was wrong about that"? There is a long pause. You don't have to say yes, I say. "I'm thinking about itI certainly as a minister, poll tax was obviously wrong.</p>
      <p>As Home Secretary I'm not sure, nothing very obvious, to be honest."</p>
      <p>Neither does he regret introducing Section 28, he says, because "it was a particular response to a particular problemI we don't face the same problem now".</p>
      <p>Has he moved to the left or right since leaving office? "I don't know how helpful those terms are." (All three party leaders make this point.) "There are people who are right-wing on some things, left-wing on others." I ask him to give me an example of something he is left-wing on. He thinks the Government should pressure the United Nations to allow the African Union to send more troops to prevent the murder in Darfur. "I don't think that is left-wing," he says, "but it is something people would think of as left-wing." He says he has become "a bit less impatientI I'm more tolerant than I used to be."</p>
      <p>Time to send for Sandra. A fortnight after the formal interview, I met Howard again, this time in his constituency of Folkestone and Hythe, where he is known as a more than averagely assiduous member. "I've missed no more than a handful of surgeries in the 20-odd years I've been here." He says he likes constituency work and I believe him, though a cynic would point to his slimmish majority of 5,907 at the last election. He was more relaxed down in Kent, and especially so at his house there with its view over Romney Marsh, bookcases full of Churchill biographies and 19th-century election posters on the walls. (There were also twin portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on the windowsill.) Sandra laid out a pot of tea and a nice bit of date and walnut loaf from the Co-op. Nick Howard, the Howards' son, who is studying for the priesthood, was around, raiding his mother's fridge in time-honoured fashion ("with her permission", he stressed).</p>
      <p>Guy Black, a member of the metropolitan liberal elite if ever there was one, picked his way through a succession of farmyards. "I get jumpy in the countryside after a while," he confessed to me near a duckpond. Not so Howard. He zipped about, opening disability centres, meeting the locals, getting stuck in with the ruddy-faced NFU chaps and their labradors, even though he's more of a cat man himself (he has two, Martha and Prudence, a homage to the White Album). "Hello, puss," he said softly to a wandering feline. I said hey, you could have a really nice life down here. "There are other things I could do," he agreed. "I don't want to be prime minister for the joy or the perks of it. I want to be prime minister because I think this country is heading fundamentally in the wrong directionI..." and off he went again, remorselessly on message. Alastair Campbell would approve.</p>
      <p>Howard was known as something of a young London blade in the Sixties and early Seventies (he met Sandra in 1973) with his Lotus and his love of all things American and a steady stream of girlfriends. He makes an unlikely Austin Powers, granted, but there's still a trace of his youth in his natty suits, the way he wears his hair a bit too long at the back and the Elvis limited-edition UK singles boxed set in his living room. He isn't one of those Norman Tebbit Tories who think all modern ills can be traced to the Sixties. "On the whole," he says, "I think the Sixties were a good thing."</p>
      <p>At one point, Sandra told him she had to go off for five minutes to make a phone call and did he need her for anything? "Well, for everything, darling, but not right now," he replied suavely. I could almost believe he was sending himself up. But such moments were rare, and I have to confess that the "real" Michael Howard, the man whom his friends and allies (and wife) say is so warm and wonderful, eluded me. What I found instead was an efficient professional seizing a chance to expose what he sees as his opponent's weaknesses and talk up his own strengths. That's fair enough, that's his job after all, but it isn't particularly instructive, or much fun to be around.</p>
      <p>What struck me most about him was his punctiliousness. He is a man who makes very clear distinctions between the public and the private, the political and the personal. Such distinctions are obviously no friend to the magazine interviewer, more significantly they are the enemy of charisma too. The most animated Howard became in our time together, I think it is worth noting, was in excoriating Tony Blair's informal administrative style, the "denocracy" criticised in the Butler report. The first thing he would do as Prime Minister, he says, the very first thing, is rescind the Order in Council that gives (one, formerly two) political appointees the power to direct civil servants. "New Labour was a brilliant opposition and it still is," he says. "It's never really bothered to learn the ropes of government."</p>
      <p>You would want, I say, things done in a certain way? "That's right," he says emphatically, "I wouldn't want a whole load of vitally important meetings done without minutes taken of them." Does it offend your sense of propriety? "Yes. It's not the way to do things." Isn't Blair's informality more in tune, however, with the way the country wants to be? "We're not talking about what you do when you get home at night," he says scathingly, tapping the table for emphasis. "Whether you take your tie off and pour yourself a beer and watch television. We're talking about the serious business of government."</p>

      <title>The virginity myth and the G-spot shock</title>
      <subtitle>No, virgins don't have an 'intact' hymen - that's just one of the 'facts' debunked by two young doctors who've set out to educate women, says Helen Rumbelow</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is nice that little boys are so proud of their penises. It's an enthusiasm that never goes away: a lifetime bromance of "check out this little chap" swagger. Their wrinkly tube of erectile tissue gets to be a wingman, with a name, a personality and a lot of reflected glory. Could women ever feel this fantastic about their genitals?</p>
      <p>They would, argue two young Norwegian medics, if only they knew the truth. The truth that the medical profession has not exactly covered up, but never bothered to uncover in the first place. So Nina Brochmann and Ellen Stokken Dahl have boldly gone where no man has gone before (I know, um, technically not true, this is a metaphor, bear with me). In the 20th century male explorers finally reached the North Pole; the depths of the deepest ocean; and all the way to the moon. It has taken until the 21st century for two women to plant their little flags on the uncharted vagina.</p>
      <p>"It's almost as if men from different cultures and historical eras ganged up to find ways of limiting women's sexuality," they write in their new book, The Wonder Down Under.</p>
      <p>We meet in the Times office in a soundproofed meeting room. It looks to various nearby colleagues that I may be discussing sales with two fashionable Scandinavians. Instead I am having the most hardcore conversation of my life. At one point I preface a reasonably gross question with, "I don't know if this is too much information, but …" and they shake their open Norwegian faces at me to signal "no such thing". Out of the corner of my eye I catch a senior executive walking by as they are estimating the true size of my clitoris, using hand gestures in the manner of fishermen describing their catch.</p>
      <p>After an hour I stagger out of the room a changed woman. As if I'd been let in on mind-blowing secrets. How did I not know this stuff? Just for starters: the entire human race has been misinformed about the hymen. A body part we can easily look at, but have no idea how. This ignorance seems on a scale with flat-earthism: not just silly, but dangerous. It has been used for millennia - and still is - to judge women's "purity", and the whole thing is just a stupid hoax. It would be funny if it wasn't sad.</p>
      <p>I immediately give the staff of Times2 a pop quiz that includes, among other fun sub-categories (you can borrow this for your next family Christmas), female erections. Only one point is scored, and that is by the only vagina-free person in the www.room.No wonder their TED talk, The Virginity Fraud, which manages to be hilarious and angry and features a hula hoop getting laid, has been viewed more than two million times.</p>
      <p>"We were sexual education teachers," says Brochmann, who is the dark-haired one, and at 30 is a qualified doctor and mother living in Oslo, "and we were spreading the same old myths."</p>
      <p>Dahl nods. She is 26, blonde and about to qualify as a doctor. "We misled women by following a medical curriculum that was incorrect even though it was written by doctors. That's the reason we wrote this book.</p>
      <p>We started to question these 'truths' that get handed down."</p>
      <p>Together, they took a deep dive into the research. The clitoris and the hymen are the sort of north and south of the ignorance, with a lot else in between. The pair had, during their medical training, spent years volunteering as sexual health teachers in high schools and clinics. They had taught the clitoris "as a little knob".</p>
      <p>"It was only quite far into medical school we realised it was this huge organ," Brochmann says.</p>
      <p>It is about 7cm to 12cm long, extending under the skin in - if I am allowed a poetic bit of symbolism - the shape of a wishbone. Any rumour of a G-spot is actually just feeling the gigantic clitoris from within.</p>
      <p>If only we could see it, little girls might be boasting about their whoppers in the shower. It's the same size as a penis.</p>
      <p>"Yes. Exactly the same," Brochmann says. "And women have seven or eight erections while they sleep, and often have 'morning glory' just like men do. They are mostly unaware of this."</p>
      <p>Dahl says: "It shows we still focus too much on vaginal sex. It is very empowering for women to understand they have this extremely large erectile organ only to give them pleasure."</p>
      <p>How many doctors, I ask, are aware of the true size of clitorises? Well, says Dahl, "it was news to us. I was sad about the way it was taught in medical school. There were three seminars on male sexuality and one on female, mostly focused on pain … Perhaps most younger doctors know."</p>
      <p>"No," Brochmann says. "I don't think they do. And ignorance about the size of the clitoris among doctors is a good symbol of the problem - how women have been under-prioritised in medicine. These things have been known in the medical community for a long time, say 150 years. But it has been taken out of the anatomy books. They are not interested in female sexual health, it is not considered prestigious or important. As long as we are able to produce children, it doesn't really matter what we can do down there."</p>
      <p>It is a theme of their book that female physiology is actually more similar to the male than we understand. For example, it is a trope of every school biology lesson that the egg waits to be fertilised, while millions of sperm compete to claim her. In fact, to be fertilised the egg itself must compete with a thousand other eggs within the ovaries to win the first prize of ovulation, in a close mirror of the sperm's ordeals.</p>
      <p>"We are so happy to view the female as the passive sex, receiving the male," Brochmann says. "It's very easy to talk about the heroic sperm, rushing off into the battlefield to reach the waiting maiden. But the egg is herself an athlete, she is the best egg. Our bodies don't fit the stories we tell about them. The same with clitorises and hymens."</p>
      <p>Ah yes, we come to the nub of it.</p>
      <p>The hymen. As an example of the greatest misinformation spread by the most experts, it is hard to beat. Present sexual education programmes describe the hymen as some kind of membrane: in their TED talk the pair hold up a hula hoop with clingfilm stretched across to illustrate. That's what we are constantly told - "We also succumbed to the hymen myth," they say. There was so little credible research on the hymen they had to consult forensic medical examiners to establish the truth. Medical textbooks are, they say, riddled with errors. It is "hair-raising to think that doctors have shown so little interest in a structure that can cause modern women to lose their honour or their lives", they write in the book.</p>
      <p>In fact the hymen is a seal formed in female embryos, possibly a redundant piece of evolutionary tissue from our aquatic ancestors. The seal then dissolves before birth, leaving a residual ring. For those who believe - and millions do - that hymens equate to virginity, this means that women lose their virginity in the womb. If a girl has a hymen that looks anything like a "seal" they have a serious medical problem. In fact it looks like a frill around the vagina entrance: in their TED talk they illustrate it with a stretchy scrunchie.</p>
      <p>Bizarrely many textbooks describe the hymen as deep within the vagina. "I have no idea why they say that," Brochmann says. It's only further proof of ignorance; the same with the ideas of "breaking" it by riding a bike and all the other things whispered about in sleepovers across the globe.</p>
      <p>"The myth is still everywhere," Dahl says. "We have a list of TV shows and films that talk about the hymen in the wrong way. Everything from Girls to True Blood, Outlander, Fifty Shades of Grey. It's crazy."</p>
      <p>Dahl says she frequently has patients approach her worried about seeing "uneven bumps" and are shocked to be told it is their hymen, there plainly on view. The upshot of all of this is that any kind of "virginity check" is plainly pointless. In 1906 a research study was conducted to test the hymen myth: a doctor examined lifelong prostitutes and virgins and could tell no difference in their hymens. Men, the pair say, love the idea of "popping" a girl: in the TED talk Dahl punches through the clingfilm on the hula hoop and says: "It is easy to say this hoop is not a virgin any more." Women, though, are not sealed like jars of instant coffee.</p>
      <p>Fewer than half of women report bleeding when they first have www.sex.No one knows which part of the vagina is bleeding - possibly an irritated hymen, possibly not - research is scanty. Possibly being told a fictional part of your anatomy is about to be ruptured by a battering ram makes things worse. Anyway, why, they ask, is all this medieval absurdity still going on? After their TED talk, now much translated, they have been inundated with desperate messages from women from the Middle East, threatened with violence because their hymen didn't behave as the textbooks predicted. In the UK doctors do a thriving private trade in "hymenoplasty", to "re-virginise" women from repressive cultures. What are they actually doing, I ask.</p>
      <p>"It's actually really horrible," Brochmann says. "They take some skin folds inside the vagina and stitch it so tight that even a small penis must do some damage, must rip it open. Many doctors keep these myths alive by providing these services."</p>
      <p>That gets them on to other kinds of plastic surgery women have, such as the "Barbie", to cut away a woman's undercarriage to almost nothing.</p>
      <p>"When we learn about puberty in school, we hear about how the penis grows. Boys even look forward to it," Brochmann says. "No one talks about how female genitals get more dominant, change colour. If you saw an adult man with a boy's tiny penis, you would think, 'Oh no, what happened?' But with women it's the other way around. The ideal of the plastic surgeon is to make labia small, hairless, like a child's. So strange. We rarely get men worrying their penis is ugly. It's sad, women are so afraid not to be liked when completely normal."</p>
      <p>All this doesn't quite convey the tone of the book. They like to refer to the vagina as the "mouse", as it is nicknamed in Norwegian (probably more accurate in scale anyway than a cat), and in entirely fond terms. They believed Norway was an open-minded audience - the Norwegian cover displays a full-frontal crotch shot, which they find beautiful - but then came the book's first review.</p>
      <p>"The reviewer wrote that after reading this book he never wanted to have sex again," Dahl says. "I think it was the word 'discharge'."</p>
      <p>They erupt into laughter. "Lots of women got angry with him, which turned into a kind of PR stunt. But he illustrated the need. If you want to have sex with women, you have to appreciate that we are human beings and this is how we are made." The Wonder Down Under by Nina Brochmann and Ellen Stokken Dahl is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton on March 8 at £14.99</p>

      <subject>HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT</subject>
      <title>I am fed up with reading newspaper articles in which housework is vaunted as the new sex</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>EVERY so often a copy of HN, the Harvey Nichols magazine, falls through my letterbox. I don't exactly know why it does. Presumably some kind Harvey Nichols press officer has decided that I need reminding from time to time of the glamorous days when my regular programme for Saturdays used to consist of a morning's light shopping on floors two and three of the Knightsbridge store, then two glasses of champagne over lunch with a girlfriend in the dinky fifth-floor restaurant.</p>
      <p>But since those carefree days I have acquired a son and a horse, who between them have stripped my life of all this sort of fantasy. These days I buy my clothes in a state of virtuous sobriety, at the Oxfam shop and the Wealden Saddlery. But still, I rather like getting the magazine. Even if I can't afford any of the things in it (there is a fabulous pair of YSL shoes in the latest issue, in a sort of peachy kid with very fine ankle straps and a set of lips in chocolate and silver enamel on each toe, for just a fraction less than the cost of a month's livery bill), it strikes a pleasingly exotic note as it flops on to the mat, like an ambassador from a distant land, full of gloriously improbable stories of camelopards and anthropophagi with heads in the middle of their stomachs and single legs on which they travel in a series of brisk hopping movements.</p>
      <p>So I was leafing through the current issue, sighing over the YSL shoes and trying to decode some of the more runic pronouncements when I found, under the heading Ten Steps To Domestic Bliss, the following instruction: "Keep a bottle of vodka under the sink for red wine crises." In some ways, this was the most sensible remark I'd read in the entire magazine, though aspects of it struck me as odd.</p>
      <p>These days I find it unwise to mix wine and spirits too recklessly, so what I tend to keep in case of red wine crises is another bottle of red wine. And then, why under the sink in this furtive fashion, and not in the cupboard with the rest of the drink? Reading on, it turned out that it was because you weren't meant to drink the vodka but -duh! -to scurry about pouring it on red wine stains, should one of your guests have the agonising social misfortune to spill some over your soft furnishings. "Vodka will remove red wine from almost anything," apparently.</p>
      <p>Now I know this is the season for getting your house by the throat and grappling it into a state of stain-free submission. My local supermarket is doing a special offer on all sorts of brightly coloured cleaning products with don't-mess with-me names. You can get a bottle of bleach and stuff for mopping the floor, and some other stuff for cleaning ovens and a packet of J-cloths and a spray can of something called Peach and Jasmine Glade, all for a fiver and, in a way, despite the Glade, I am quite tempted, not least because a really vigorous bout of housework is a sovereign antidote against all kinds of melancholy, whether one is crossed in love or semi-hysterical with anxiety about global warfare.</p>
      <p>But I am going to resist the temptation, out of pure perversity, because I am fed up with opening newspapers and magazines in search of distraction, only to find yet another article in which housework is vaunted as the New Sex. The neurotic domestic imperatives of Martha Stewart seem to be spreading like a virus across the Atlantic. First Vogue, then HN magazine, strap themselves coyly into the sprigged pinny of Mrs Beeton (or not, as the case may be. HN's domestic tips were illustrated with a strangely revolting picture from Imitation of Christ's spring/summer 2003 show, featuring very thin topless models in black knickers and high heels, wielding Dysons and looking, as well they might, a bit tight lipped).</p>
      <p>And at the weekend one of the broadsheet review sections had two separate columns on how to be a good housekeeper, plus a sneering piece by some woman on how useless her cleaner was.</p>
      <p>These acres of prose on the subject of homemaking are testimony, of course, to the intense seductiveness of housework. The gratification is delayed enough to make one feel virtuous, swift enough to make one feel happy. Turning out a linen cupboard or dusting the tricky places behind the radiator feel headily like hard work -and, of course, the most marvellous thing of all about housework is that it is never finished.</p>
      <p>You can pause for a moment, with a cup of coffee and a biscuit, and reflect on the novels you would have written, the pictures you would have painted, the businesses you might have set up, if only you hadn't had so much to do. In that moment of leisure an idea might even come to you. But before you can jot it down, you've just got to vacuum the cream cracker crumbs from under the sofa...and before you know it, your life is gone, measured out in slops of Chateau Chasse-Spleen with a Stolly chaser.</p>
      <p>PERHAPS fortunately, I can't remember anything about my sex education, though I suppose I must have had some at some point. I hadn't really got around to tackling the subject with my son, either, though the early-evening bits of Comic Relief the other day rather bounced us into the subject, what with Aids, Child Abuse, Drugs and Prostitution all vividly to the fore and requiring explanation in the intervals between Basil Brush and Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>But in any case, his school was ahead of me. "We had sex education today," he said, disappearing behind the shower curtain one evening last week. He said nothing else for a while, and I thought he looked a bit shell-shocked when he came out, so I just passed him a towel and said: "Well, darling, now you know where babies come from. And kittens," I added, since the cat, which is fond of Alexander, had strolled into the bathroom to see what was going on. It was the wrong thing to say. Alexander's face froze in a rictus of shock and dismay. "Oh no," he said. "What, you mean cats do that stuff, too?"</p>

      <title>Barrister and novelist known for leaping to his feet in the manner of television court dramas and who objected to a snoring judge</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Edmund Romilly may have been a barrister in the Rumpole mould, but he preferred to see himself as a novelist for whom appearing in the crown court was just the day job. Nevertheless, he was a highly respected advocate who tenaciously defended all manner of alleged criminals, ranging from petty offenders to jewellery thieves.</p>
      <p>Only a handful of his cases attracted publicity, with perhaps the most prominent being an appeal in 2003 by one of the men convicted of conspiring to steal diamonds worth £200 million from the Millennium Dome. Romilly's argument hinged on allegations that Michael Coombe, the original judge, not only snatched 40 winks during the trial, but also distracted the jury with his snoring. "Everyone can be forgiven for momentary lapses of concentration," Romilly declared. "But it is another thing if there is sleepfulness accompanied by noises associated with sleep." The appeal judges did not agree.</p>
      <p>Another of Romilly's significant cases was R v Bullici in 2007, a trial that involved allegations of largescale heroin dealing by Turkish gangs in the Green Lanes area of north London. Romilly represented only one of the defendants in this nine-handed case, but such was his tenacious advocacy style that he soon became the favourite barrister of all the defendants.</p>
      <p>He was particularly strong at crossexamining police officers, or giving them "a right mauling" as he put it, and was often mesmeric when summing up for juries. Yet he did so while maintaining a broad charm and good humour. Romilly was renowned for taking every point, albeit not always the best points, giving the impression that he was utterly fearless in cross-examination. He would leap to his feet to make submissions, a practice seen more frequently in US television legal dramas than in English courtrooms. On one occasion he disarmingly told a judge that he was about to make "one of my after-dinner submissions".</p>
      <p>Romilly's true love, however, was writing. In 2006 he published two novels: Skinner, a kitchen-sink tale of a man beset by schizophrenia and alcoholism who feels that he is told by God to embark on a murderous mission, and The Barn, the story of a Londoner trapped in a dull job and life who becomes a ghostwriter. His third novel, Victims, published in 2015, was far more autobiographical; the central character is a casino worker named Giles whose father dies intestate, just as Romilly's father, also called Giles, had done.</p>
      <p>Edmund Romilly was born in July 1951 and brought up in London. He was a great-nephew of Winston Churchill and a great-great-great grandson of Sir Samuel Romilly, the abolitionist and law reformer. His father was a journalist and author who was imprisoned by the Nazis in Colditz Castle. Despite Colditz having a reputation for being impossible to escape from, Giles and a Dutch fellow prisoner did just that and Romilly Sr later told his story in a memoir, The Privileged Nightmare.</p>
      <p>The family lived in a house in Pimlico Road that was leased from Wellington Barracks. Edmund and his sister, Elizabeth, would sit transfixed as soldiers marched past to Buckingham Palace. They also had a house in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, that the children visited four times a year. He enjoyed town and country but showed a preference for the former. There was a rocking horse at Huntingdon that he would ride enthusiastically, shouting: "Up to London, up to London …" He attended the French Lycée in South Kensington, a nod to the family's Huguenot heritage. While Edmund was a cheeky child at home, he was shy and introverted at school. When the flamboyant Elizabeth performed an impromptu can-can in the lycée playground, Romilly swore to his classmates: "No, she is not my sister." His parents had a tempestuous relationship and by the time that Edmund and Elizabeth were 10 and 11 respectively, the marriage had ended. They were taken to York by their mother, Mary Marshall, and grandmother. An enraged Giles travelled there and, in breach of a court order, barged into the grandmother's house, gathered them up, bundled them into a cab and put them on a flight to New York.</p>
      <p>order They were enrolled in the Joan of Arc Junior High School in New York, while Giles attempted to resume his career as a writer. Their financial position was parlous because their mother had sequestered all her former husband's property. Nonetheless, Giles showed ingenuity and grit, taking jobs selling Bibles and the Encyclopaedia Britannica to support the family, although with limited success.</p>
      <p>They moved to Chicago and ultimately to Berkeley, on the east side of the San Francisco Bay. There, Edmund and Elizabeth were enrolled in Willard Junior High School. Since it was the time of the Cuban missile crisis, there were routine exercises for a nuclear attack. Huddled in a shelter, Lizzie would whisper reassurances that Armageddon was never going to happen. After a year Giles returned the children to England before returning to America, where he killed himself.</p>
      <p>Edmund, now at Marlborough College in Wiltshire, was deeply affected by his father's suicide. Nevertheless, he went on to read philosophy at University College London. Interested in the arts, he headed to Devon, where he took a job in an arts centre, writing plays and occasionally performing.</p>
      <p>His mother eventually convinced him to get a "real job". He studied for the Bar and was called to Gray's Inn in 1983. Meanwhile, he became a regular at Ronnie Scott's. In the early stages of his career Romilly had a fairly general legal practice, but he soon began to focus almost exclusively on criminal law.</p>

      <p>Zimbabwe: Years of Hope and Despair</p>
      <p>by Philip Barclay</p>
      <p>Bloomsbury, £17.99 £16.19, 256pp</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe memoir has become almost a genre in its own right. To the growing pile of books about the beleaguered country can now be added The Last Resort: A Zimbabwe Memoir by Douglas Rogers and Zimbabwe: Years of Hope and Despair by Philip Barclay. Rogers, a Zimbabwe-born journalist now living in New York, writes about his family in Zimbabwe, while Barclay, a British diplomat who was posted to Zimbabwe, presents what can be called an inside account over three crucial "years of hope and despair".</p>
      <p>In The Last Resort Rogers makes no pretence of telling the larger story of his country. Indeed, his impatience with politics and history is almost palpable: the passages in which Rogers explains the history of Zimbabwe read as though written at editorial behest. Thankfully, these do not weigh down the narrative, which goes straight into the lives of the writer's wonderfully vivid parents, Lyn and Ros Rogers. At the heart of the story is their struggle to hold on to Drifters, the game farm and backpackers' lodge near Mutare that they bought after Zimbabwean independence.</p>
      <p>The author weaves together the stories of his parents, their employees and assorted characters (moneychangers, prostitutes, ruling party stalwarts, new farmers and various wheelers and dealers) who come in and out of their lives to produce a memoir that is both funny and deeply moving.</p>
      <p>Crucially, Rogers manages to capture the surrealistic absurdity at the heart of the Zimbabwean condition: the scene in which he smokes marijuana in the mud hut of an elderly black couple is alone equal to anything by Buñuel or Duchamp.</p>
      <p>The extent to which the lives of blacks and whites were separated by white privilege is often overlooked in the story of the hard-done-by white farmers of Zimbabwe. As Rogers writes, whites "made money and paid taxes, but despite being Zimbabweans, lived a life apart, a privileged minority behind the high walls of their sprawling homes and sports clubs". The Last Resort is ultimately about the loss of that privilege and the fragilities exposed by its loss. Whether dispossessed or facing dispossession, the Rogers and their white friends and neighbours find themselves in similar circumstances to their black employees, criminalised by the necessity of the black market and at the mercy of an economic system in which greed and out-and-out theft are given the benediction of state policy, all while trying to find meaning in an increasingly bizarre world.</p>
      <p>Rogers' compassion, humour and frequent bemusement give this heart-stoppingly good book its life force. He is keenly aware of the dangers of oversimplification. People, he discovers, are people, even in Mutare. He is kind to his white characters without absolving them of benefiting from Zimbabwe's historical inequities. His black characters, even the dastardly land invaders, are fully embodied persons with agency, and not simply symbols of Robert Mugabe's degradation or thuggishness. In telling the story of his parents, their home and the people who come in and out of their lives, Rogers displays a sensitive understanding of the strange allegiances and unexpected contradictions at the heart of Zimbabwe. It is perhaps as well that, at 86 and with a country to ruin further, Mugabe may be too busy to read Barclay's memoir Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwean President's speeches reveal a paranoid conviction that the British seek to overthrow him. This memoir may well convince him that just because he is paranoid does not mean that they are not out to get him.</p>
      <p>Barclay was posted to Zimbabwe from 2006 to 2009, the years of hope and despair of the book's title, a period including the last Zimbabwean elections. He was a second secretary in the political section of the British Embassy, a job description broad and vague enough to include activities such as overseeing development projects, meeting civil society activists and other "contacts", attending political trials where he "was often the only white person in the courtroom", creeping into a refugee camp after dark "to avoid bloodthirsty gangs", entering a hospital "through a hole in the fence to avoid security officials", examining the injuries of victims of political violence - including the bruised buttocks of a woman who looked at him with "mournful dignity", culminating in an incident on his way back to Harare after a field trip when he stops at a prison hoping to see a recently arrested MDC politician and is challenged by security agents.</p>
      <p>None of Barclay's revelations will surprise anyone who has followed events in Zimbabwe, particularly the Zanu (PF) terror campaigns that have become a depressing and permanent feature of Zimbabwe's elections. For all its research and its sincerity, it is a difficult book to read because at its heart lies an unexamined assumption of the rightness of recent British policy towards Zimbabwe. There is little active engagement with the larger question: why Zimbabwe? What is it about this small country that justifies the extraordinary interest that Britain has taken in its affairs and that makes permissible the unusual liberties that Barclay took in his job as a diplomat? Britain's concern for the human rights of Zimbabweans is not a convincing explanation.</p>
      <p>At the start of Labour's term in government in 1997, Robin Cook, then Foreign Secretary, talked of "an ethical dimension" to British foreign policy and promised "to put human rights at the heart of our foreign policy". But it was soon clear that Britain's concern for human rights was selective and hypocritical. Saudi Arabia and Swaziland, absolute monarchies, suffer far worse political repression than Zimbabwe, yet they have never attracted the levels of opprobrium that were directed at Zimbabwe. Indeed, as Mugabe was isolated for human rights abuses, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the unelected monarch of a country that disenfranchises women, allows no religious freedom and allows only very limited participatory democracy, was fêted at Buckingham Palace and a British government minister talked of "shared values".</p>
      <p>It is unfortunate that this hypocrisy has given Mugabe something of a moral victory and allowed him to frame the British concern for Zimbabwean human rights as a cloak for the real concern: the white farmers, Britain's dispossessed "kith and kin". And the overt British support for the MDC has given mileage to the Mugabean narrative of an Opposition controlled by the British to effect "regime change", a perspective that has all too unfortunately been accepted by Zimbabwe's African neighbours, much to the detriment of the MDC. Barclay also skates over difficult questions about the unusual liberties that he took in his job as a foreign diplomat.</p>
      <p>To his credit, he concedes that his activities give rise to uncomfortable questions. But he evades these questions by relying on a hair-splitting interpretation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. And yet the convention's core principle - non-interference by diplomats in the internal affairs of their hosts - is clear. It applies with equal force to Russian diplomats in London as it does to British diplomats in Harare. Barclay's assumption appears to be that this core international legal principle can be waived in the pursuit of the higher goal of exposing human rights violations in repressive states. But it is not at all likely that a British diplomat would march to a prison in Tehran as Barclay did in Zimbabwe, or sneak into a Beijing hospital through a hole in the fence or inspect the buttocks of a battered woman in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>And it is this that makes, for this reader at least, the central concern of the book ring hollow. Even as one agrees with Barclay that Zimbabwe has suffered unconscionable pain and damage at the hands of its leadership, it is not possible to read this account without thinking of the multiple hypocrisies and double standards of Britain's attitude to violations of human rights by its international partners.</p>
      <p>This lack of introspection aside, Zimbabwe is a meticulous and well-written book. It is therefore a pity that it is occasionally spoilt by entirely unnecessary pseudoanthropological observations. Viewing a local dance, Barclay writes that rural Zimbabwean women over 30 either become thin and die of Aids or "they obtain a substantial rotundity, especially about the buttocks, a welcome development because a generous bottom is at the heart of the traditional style of beauty in Zimbabwe". Listening to the testimony of alleged rape victims, he marvels that they speak out in spite of the "traditional submissiveness of Shona women". He makes too much and too little of the differences between Zimbabwe's main ethnic groups: he oversimplifies the history of Shona-Ndebele relations and at the same time misses the factionalism among the various Shona groups within Zanu (PF) - Mugabe's ability to play off these factions has been an importantor factor in his success.</p>
      <p>The Last Resort and Zimbabwe are hugely important books. But while Barclay paints the picture of a country in crisis in broad brushstrokes, it is Rogers, who, by zooming in on a detail of the bigger picture, gives a better understanding of the joys, sorrows and contradictions of Zimbabwe.</p>

      <title>A little bit of horseplay</title>
      <subtitle>It began in a wine cellar in 1950s Paris and now Crazy Horse cabaret has arrived in London. But what does it take to be a Crazy girl? Eva Simpson finds out</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Daizy Blu and Mina Velours are attempting to help me form the perfect arch with my back. "Like this," says Daizy, effortlessly moving into position, her back forming a perfect semicircle. "Try to lift your bottom, but elegantly, don't just stick it up and in the air." I try to follow her instructions, but am quickly discovering that elegance isn't my forte. Standing on a blackened stage under the glare of the spotlights I feel more like a stuffed chicken than a dancer at Le Crazy Horse, the iconic Parisian cabaret where nude dancers have been thrilling and titillating audiences for more than 60 years.</p>
      <p>For the first time in the show's history, it is being staged in London, brought over by Harvey Goldsmith, the promoter. On this side of the Channel it's called Forever Crazy and I have been invited to a purpose-built venue on London's South Bank, its temporary home for the next three months, to be put through my paces.</p>
      <p>With my back arch semi-sorted, my knees locked together, arms poker straight at my sides and hands clenched into fists, I am now in position to try out some of the elaborate steps. We start with God Save Our Bareskin, a routine that features the Queen's Guard as you've never seen them before, and one which has opened every Crazy Horse Paris show for the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>On the count of eight, Daizy tells me, we're going to start marching.</p>
      <p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. I throw out my right leg and start marching furiously - I look like I'm trying to kick in a front door. Needless to say, Daizy and Mina lead off with their left legs, taking snappy but elegant steps.</p>
      <p>"Shall we try that again?" Daizy suggests patiently. I half smile. "This time," she says, "try and go on eight and use the right leg."</p>
      <p>The right leg? Does she mean my right leg or the correct one, that is to say the left? I'm already confused. If I can't get the marching right what hope do I have with anything else? Crazy Horse is described by critics as the world's most sexist cabaret and by the owners as sensual striptease. It tours around the world featuring dancers who perform a succession of vignettes interspersed with variety acts including magicians, mime artists and jugglers.</p>
      <p>It claims to set itself apart from its boisterous high-kicking neighbour, the Moulin Rouge, by being suggestive rather than explicit.</p>
      <p>Although the girls are naked, stage lights are used to "dress the body" so quite a lot is left to the imagination. "Men get all excited because we're naked, but then they get disappointed when they see it because you don't see anything at the end of the day," says Enny Gmatic, an Anglo-French dancer. Her observation of audience disappointment is backed up by online feedback with reviews on Tripadvisor particularly lukewarm.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless it remains a Parisian institution. Every year more than 1,000 female dancers answer the call to try out for a starring role in Le Crazy, but only a few dozen are chosen.</p>
      <p>"We have very tough criteria," admits Andree Deissenberg, the managing director, who alongside show managers Emilie Briois, Svetlana Konstantinova and Cristina Popa chooses the girls for the shows. The quartet make Simon Cowell sound like a nursery school teacher. "Sometimes we see 100 girls and pick zero."</p>
      <p>Nooka Karamel, a porcelain-skinned dancer whose face is framed by a platinum blonde, cropped hairstyle, appears to shudder when she recalls her first audition.</p>
      <p>"You never forget it," she says. "I was really stressed - you're nude of course and for me that was the first time. But I really wanted to be here so I tried it and it worked."</p>
      <p>The girls, who must all be classically trained dancers, have to conform to strict criteria laid down by Alain Bernardin, the show's late founder, who started the show in a wine and potato cellar in the heart of Paris in 1951, before committing suicide in 1994.</p>
      <p>The dancers must fulfil these criteria: height between 1.68-1.72m (5ft 6-7in); distance between nipples 21cm; distance from navel to pubis 13cm; leg length in proportion to torso 2:1. "We like womanly curves and Alain Bernardin's measurements reflect that," Deissenberg says. "If you have a long gap between the navel and the pubis then you start getting the teardrop shape and we don't like teardrop shapes. We like nice round butts."</p>
      <p>Other no-nos are bodies covered in tattoos or fake breasts. It's also a "minimum requirement, non-negotiable, that the girls have to be pretty".</p>
      <p>If they satisfy the physical criteria the next thing the judges look for is personality - it is hard to pin down what exactly that is but is appears to boil down to whether the girls have that all-important stage presence.</p>
      <p>The successful candidates are sent to the city's famous Avenue George V - which is still home to Bernardin's original Crazy Horse venue - where they spend the next three to four months in Crazy Girl boot camp.</p>
      <p>"We deconstruct the girls," explains Deissenberg, who has been in charge of the shows for the past six years. "We deconstruct her from a classical ballerina into a Crazy Girl." This involves everything from teaching the girls a very specific way of moving that is "100 per cent Crazy Horse" and stops everything "hanging out", to retraining them to think about food.</p>
      <p>Deissenberg explains: "We have girls who have been classical ballerinas for 15 or 20 years and they're told not to gain an ounce and to be really skinny and to suffer and that's the classical school of thought - that's why we also have to do a kind of mental deconstruction."</p>
      <p>During bootcamp the dancers also have their hair cut and coloured and are taught the correct way to apply make-up, paying particular attention to their bright red lips.</p>
      <p>Eventually, when she is ready to take to the stage for the first time, the girl is presented with her stage name.</p>
      <p>"She is only allowed to reject her chosen name once and then she gets a second one and she has to stick with it," Deissenberg says. "It's a real transformation. It's like you take plain Susie Winchester and she becomes a Nooka Karamel and after that she will never tell you her real name."</p>
      <p>Life at the Crazy Horse is glamorous - the girls dance in Christian Louboutin stilettos and have handmade costumes - and they are watched by an A-list audience that has included Salvador Dali, Madonna and Steven Spielberg.</p>
      <p>The girls are inundated with letters declaring undying love, flowers, invitations to dinner - it's not unheard of to receive marriage proposals. But off stage is a strict existence. While Deissenberg insists that the days of girls living "convent-like" is a thing of the past, listening to dancers Nooka and Enny I can't help but think their lives appear very controlled.</p>
      <p>Alongside the endless hours of rehearsals it is written into every girl's contract that she must be weighed every week to ensure that she hasn't gained or lost too much weight. Most girls tip the scales at around 8st 7lb (54kg). But if their weight goes up or down by more than 2kg they risk being kicked off the show.</p>
      <p>If they arrive with a small tattoo, they are contractually forbidden to get any more.</p>
      <p>"There's someone watching you at every show," reveals Enny, 27. "They come and see you afterwards to tell you what was right and what was wrong, so yes you do have to keep up."</p>
      <p>Dancers are also banned from fraternising with members of the audience and men are not allowed in the dressing rooms.</p>
      <p>It goes without saying they have to leave if they get pregnant. They are allowed to reaudition but women rarely make it back.</p>
      <p>"There was a dancer who wanted to come back but her breasts were down to here," says Deissenberg pointing to her belly button. "It's sad, she was a gorgeous girl but there was nothing we could do."</p>
      <p>Besides, mothers on stage isn't considered at all sexy at Crazy Horse.</p>
      <p>"We do have some," Deissenberg admits in a whisper, as if she is letting me in on a trade secret. "It's not a very sexy thing to be written in the article," she says. "But we have two or three mothers - one even has TWO kids."</p>
      <p>Four months ago dancers went on strike in a protest over wages, claiming that their salaries were not reflective of the work they do.</p>
      <p>"It was resolved very quickly," Deissenberg says. "It was all to do with getting a new president and unions wanting to show they had muscle.</p>
      <p>"There were macroeconomic reasons that were linked to our micro world - but they got what they wanted and it's what we were working on. They get decent money."</p>
      <p>For the Crazy Girls, despite all the weighing, the measuring and the watching it is all worthwhile.</p>
      <p>"It is a very prestigious thing to be in Crazy Horse," says 29-year-old Nooka, who has been with the show for nine years. "Our families are proud of us. The first time my boyfriend saw the show he had tears of pride in his eyes. It is hard work but we love what we do and that's why we keep going. You are just happy to be on stage."</p>
      <p>As for me, it's safe to say that after my audition I won't be invited back on to the Crazy stage anytime soon. As the saying goes in showbiz, it isn't quite time for me to give up the day job. Crazy Horse presents Forever Crazy runs until December 16. Tickets available from forevercrazy.co.uk</p>
      <p>Famous cabaret clubs</p>
      <p>Moulin Rouge</p>
      <p>Opened in Paris in 1889 by Joseph Oller and Charles Zidler, Moulin Rouge was immortalised by the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, who paid frequent visits to the club situated in Montmartre. He was commissioned to produce a series of posters, which were displayed on the club's walls.</p>
      <p>It is said to be the spiritual home of the cancan and its dancers are famous for their flamboyant use of feathers and sequins. It's still a thriving tourist attraction.</p>
      <p>Les Folies BergÈre</p>
      <p>Established in 1869, Paris's bawdy music hall Les Folies BergÈre was at the height of its fame from 1890-1920, when it captured the city's appetite for "exoticness".</p>
      <p>The African-American dancer Josephine Baker became an overnight sensation when she performed the "Danse sauvage" dressed only in a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas and a bikini top - one of the cabaret's typically titillating and flamboyant costumes.</p>
      <p>In 1882, the club was famously portrayed in Edouard Manet's A Bar at the Folies-BergÈre, where the hubbub of the cabaret is reflected in the mirror behind a glum-looking bar girl.</p>
      <p>Le Lido</p>
      <p>Situated on the Champs-Élysées, Le Lido opened its doors in 1946 and quickly became known for its exotic cabaret and burlesque shows, which owed more to the glitz of Las Vegas than the glamour of Paris.</p>
      <p>In 1959, while on leave from the US Army, Elvis Presley showed up at the venue and treated the audience to an impromptu performance.</p>
      <p>They spend three to four months in Crazy Girl boot camp</p>
      <p>Girls are weighed weekly to ensure they haven't gained too much</p>

      <title>The small shop blueprint to save town centres</title>
      <subtitle>There are big ambitions behind a £400m plan to redevelop a 1970s mall in Berkshire, reports Louisa Clarence-Smith</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The failure of a shopping centre in Berkshire could become a blueprint for regenerating town centres.</p>
      <p>A developer has submitted a planning application for a £400 million scheme to demolish and rebuild the Nicholsons shopping centre in Maidenhead.</p>
      <p>The centre fell into receivership in 2018 and was bought for around £25 million a year ago by Areli Real Estate, run by Rob Tincknell - who spent a decade overseeing the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station in south London - with backing from Tikehau Capital, a French investment firm.</p>
      <p>In what is thought to be the first wholesale regeneration proposal for a dilapidated centre in the retail downturn, the developer wants to demolish the 1970s structure and replace it with double the number of shops but half the overall retail space, adding new offices, 364 flats and 311 senior living homes.</p>
      <p>The proposals also feature one and a half acres of "public realm", including a square named by local residents after Sir Nicholas Winton, the late British humanitarian who saved hundreds of Jewish children from the Nazis in Prague.</p>
      <p>Only six years ago, shopping centres were attracting some of the highest values in the property sector, in turn luring in investors with the promise of landlord-friendly rental agreements with fixed annual increases. Today, Nicholsons is among about 600 shopping centres in Britain that are fighting against obsolescence as familiar high street names have closed stores or sought to cut rents. About 14.4 per cent of shopping centre units were vacant at the end of last year, the highest level since 2015, according to the Local Data Company. Vacancy levels are expected to rise again this year as retailers and restaurants struggle to survive the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
      <p>"We've spent a lot of time thinking about the future of retailing," Mr Tincknell, 53, said. "We believe it's much more about local, smaller simpler shops and the restoration of what we used to have in towns - the butcher, the baker - specialised stores run by people who really understand their catchment and their customers." He wants retail to become a "leisurebased experience" that is "fun and different", regularly updated and cannot be replicated online. "That's what is going to drive people back to towns."</p>
      <p>At present, there are about 30 shops in the Maidenhead centre spread across 190,000 sq ft. The plans include 61 shops and restaurants in about half that space. The centre is located in an affluent Berkshire commuter town, part of Theresa May's parliamentary constituency. However, a lack of investment and competition from both online retail - the scourge of bricksand-mortar stores - and nearby shopping centres in Reading and Windsor have led to a decline in shopper numbers.</p>
      <p>Mr Tincknell's plan to revive the site includes offering retailers and independent businesses more flexible lease terms linked to turnover. The investment value in the development will come from its office and residential space.</p>
      <p>"I think an important factor in all of these town centre regeneration projects is that the retail needs to become almost an ancillary part," he said. "That doesn't for a second mean that it has less attention, but from an investment point of view it has to become more of an ancillary part to other uses, which provide the core value of the scheme."</p>
      <p>Recent shopping centre development plans have focused on building flats on car parks or revamping existing facilities, replacing department stores with leisure operators. Mr Tincknell called this "tinkering around the edges. Our approach is to level the whole place, start again and build a proper, original town centre."</p>
      <p>He sees an opportunity to cater for several residential markets, from flats for the over-70s - "People in their 70s want to be in active, exciting locations. I think they also offer a huge amount to the local economy, because they're out in the daytime, shopping, supporting local stores" - to commuting professionals. Nicholsons is a five-minute walk from a railway station that will take commuters to Bond Street in London's West End in only 37 minutes once Crossrail is built.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Tincknell, the Maidenhead scheme is one of the first British shopping centres where the investment value has dropped to a level below the land value, although others are likely to follow. He hopes, too, that the plans will form a blueprint for the regeneration of town centres around Britain, getting rid of "large, monolithic structures" that close at 7pm every night.</p>
      <p>"No wonder our town centres are struggling when you've got that mass in the middle," the developer said. "What we need is to break it down again into individual streets, squares, get some density in there, get some people living there, working there - and that's what I think will revitalise our high streets."</p>
      <p>Behind the story Investment in shopping centres has slumped amid the uncertainty surrounding retailers (Louisa Clarence-Smith writes). The problem has been made worse by the coronavirus, with retailers widely deferring rent payments.</p>
      <p>However, Areli Real Estate and Tikehau Capital, which has (EURO)25 billion of assets under management, believe that values have fallen far enough to make investment opportunities in town centres with good transport connections appealing.</p>
      <p>"We're convinced that this is a very good investment thesis," Peter Cirenza, head of Tikehau Capital's London office, said. "Anything that's going to help to regenerate town centres we think will be very attractive."</p>
      <p>Nicholsons shopping centre in Maidenhead, Berkshire, was Tikehau's first British purchase from its real estate valueadded fund. It has since bought another shopping centre in Britain, the Walnuts in Orpington, southeast London, where it is working on redevelopment plans with Areli Real Estate.</p>
      <p>Mr Cirenza said that the firm "absolutely would" consider investing in similar opportunities: "Covid in the short term is limiting the extent to which people can congregate, but the current containment measures are temporary, not permanent."</p>

      <title>Strife in the House of Andersen may end in high-profile divorce</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The feud at the world's greatest professional firm could soon be settled</p>
      <p>FAMILY squabbles are always the most bitter of civil wars. And so it has been in the great battle within the Arthur Andersen family.</p>
      <p>Until December 1997 Andersen was the greatest professional services firm the world had seen. The combined revenues of Arthur Andersen, its business advisory arm, and the consultancy side of the business, Andersen Consulting, came to $ 11.3 billion (Pounds 7.5 billion). The wider firm employed more than 100,000 people in 79 countries.</p>
      <p>But all was not well in the House of Andersen. The seeds of its destruction had been planted nearly a decade earlier, in what came to be known as the "Florida accord".</p>
      <p>In 1989 partners meeting in Florida agreed to spin off the fast-growing consulting side of the business into what became Andersen Consulting. Arthur Andersen would stick to its accounting roots and offer only "financial consulting" to its clients. Andersen Consulting would stick to "business and technology consulting". Andersen Consulting would pay Arthur Andersen an annual amount in recognition of its debt to its parent firm.</p>
      <p>The sticking plaster lasted almost eight years. By 1997 the consulting business was outpacing its parent firm in growth rates and also, crucially, in fee income. The pressure to drop the annual payments and to fly the coop became too great for the consulting side, with its brasher, more arrogant culture, to bear.</p>
      <p>Added to this, the focus of the Andersen business had changed. In 1996 the numbers showed that for the first time the majority of Andersen's staff were not based in America. It was time for a change in chief executive of Andersen Worldwide, the umbrella body that ostensibly kept the two sides together.</p>
      <p>The first candidate, the newly elected head of Arthur Andersen, Jim Wadia from London, was voted down by a combination of American and consulting partners. Then George Shaheen, the man who had led Andersen Consulting since 1989 stood. He too failed to gain a majority. For him it was a humiliation. Six months later, when Wadia offered a peace formula over the payments issue, Shaheen put the whole issue into arbitration.</p>
      <p>Since then the skirmishes have been played out before the arbitrator as the battle over what they called "the delineation of separate scopes of practice" has continued. The man chosen to adjudicate in the matter is a Colombian lawyer, Guillermo Gamba. Arthur Andersen at first challenged Gamba's authority, but eventually fell into line.</p>
      <p>At last the arbitration has run its course. Gamba's findings in the case could emerge as early as today. For both parties there is much at stake. And in the manner of spoilt children both are likely to claim a victory.</p>
      <p>There are several options. The arbitrator could tell them to stick together. However, he is more likely to tell them to split and dictate terms over whether Andersen Consulting can keep the Andersen name and how much is owed to whom over the separation.</p>
      <p>When Andersen Consulting first went to arbitration it was extremely bullish. It was all going to be over in a few months and it would have its freedom and be absolved of paying anything to Arthur Andersen. At the time Vernon Ellis, Andersen Consulting's European managing director, said: "Arthur Andersen have behaved as though they have a mystical right to the money."</p>
      <p>An Arthur Andersen partner saw it differently: "Would Andersen Consulting be a $ 7 billion business if it didn't leverage off 85 years of Arthur Andersen's effort and the name?"</p>
      <p>The Arthur Andersen view is a simple one. As one partner puts it: "They tried to take something, for free, in a greedy way, which was something which we had collectively built up." In the other camp, Jon Conahan, the Andersen Consulting partner who helped to orchestrate the 1989 split, says Arthur Andersen blatantly set about muscling in on its clients and strategies. Arthur Andersen's new consulting division now generates more in revenues than Andersen Consulting did at the time the two split in 1989. This is an indication of how aggressively Arthur Andersen has pushed into consultancy work.</p>
      <p>The crucial testimony in the arbitration relates to Gerard van Kemmel, chairman of the board of partners from 1989 to 1994. He produced note after note from meetings in which George Shaheen had made comments which suggested that he had planned a separate strategy all along.</p>
      <p>Under cross-examination, Shaheen claimed not to recall any of them and, on the basis that he could not recall them, refused to deny them. For Arthur Andersen that was seen as the pivotal point. "We were staggered that George was so weak in that situation," said one partner this week.</p>
      <p>One of the van Kemmel notes suggests that Shaheen said: "If we have to split from the Andersen Worldwide organisation we will do it. We are big enough and we can handle it." Andersen's counsel asked: "Did you say that?" Shaheen replied: "I don't recall saying it. I'm not sure what it means." For Andersen, Shaheen's refusal to deny saying such things proves that the split was planned all along.</p>
      <p>As in any divorce, the amount of money to be handed over could be huge. If the price of Andersen Consulting's freedom was payment to Arthur Andersen of 150 per cent of revenues, for example, which is one of the figures bandied about earlier in the arbitration, then it would face a bill for $ 14.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Under the 1989 accord, Andersen Consulting agreed to hand over 15 per cent of its annual revenues in return for being allowed to go it alone. With interest, this adds up to a about $ 1 billion. Some $ 400 million was paid over between 1994 and 1997 and $ 535 million has been paid over since 1998. This latter sum is being held in escrow pending the outcome of arbitration.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, the two camps hope that the arbitrator will bring some finality to the situation. Far worse would be for them to remain locked in a state of permanent dispute - a marriage by name only, in which husband and wife loathe each other but have no way of severing the link.</p>
      <p>But how will the arbitrator rule? Andersen Consulting cannot see things falling anyway but in its favour. It makes reference to a "No Action" letter issued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission in June 1990 that noted: "Arthur Andersen does not hold itself out as a specialist in information technology consulting."</p>
      <p>The legal process of discovery also flushed out video footage of Arthur Andersen partners talking about plans to break into Andersen Consulting's territory. Many of the videos feature Chuck Ketteman, who was made managing partner of Arthur Andersen's business consulting practice when it was formed in the early 1990s. In one internal speech, Ketteman jokingly wondered whether the firm should bring in an accountant to help it - such had been the push into consulting.</p>
      <p>Already heads have begun to roll. Arthur Andersen issued a press release on July 25 which included a deeply buried reference to Ketteman "retiring from the firm after a 30-year-career".</p>
      <p>It is riveting stuff, but ultimately amounts to nothing more than an old-fashioned family squabble. The stakes for both sides are high. But the issues involved are simply high farce.</p>

      <title>There's a whiff of pork-barrel politics in the air</title>
      <subtitle>A new road here, a bigger hospital there: bribes are becoming the norm in politics but are alienating yet more voters</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Pork Barrel (colloq, orig N Amer): the provision of government funds obtained for particular areas or individuals on the basis of political patronage (OED).</p>
      <p>It is already common in the United States, where the phrase originated in the pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward. All over America there are bridges, tunnels and roads that are said to have been built to secure the support of a local congressman for a particular piece of legislation.</p>
      <p>Now the politics of localised financial incentives - a euphemism for bribery - may be coming to Britain. Instead of emulating a Borgen-style grand coalition, Westminster could end up with the world of policy handouts and financial sweetners portrayed so chillingly in the American version of House of Cards, in which Kevin Spacey's Francis Underwood (pictured) was a majority whip who "doesn't measure his wealth in private jets but purchased souls".</p>
      <p>I hope I'm wrong - but there was more than a whiff of the pork barrel in the recent autumn statement. George Osborne announced a £15 billion infrastructure programme that was aimed with military precision at marginal seats. Two thirds of the 65 road building schemes already approved by the Treasury were in Conservative or Liberal Democrat constituencies, including many with the smallest majorities. From the upgrading of the A47 - which runs close to Peterborough, Great Yarmouth, Waveney and Norwich North - to improvements on the A303, which takes in several marginal West Country constituencies, and the extra capacity on the A27 that benefits Brighton Kemptown, where the Tories are defending a 1,300 majority over Labour, taxpayers' money is being poured into key political battlegrounds. Already, the local Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates have written to voters claiming credit for the future reduction in traffic jams.</p>
      <p>I fear this is just the start of a trend that will only grow. As the long campaign for the 2015 general election begins officially this week - with the regulation of party spending starting on Friday - the polls indicate that the most likely result is a messy hung parliament. Neither David Cameron nor Ed Miliband has won the hearts or minds of the people. Both the Conservatives and Labour struggle with symmetrically toxic brands: one is still seen as the "party of the rich" and the other is not trusted to restore national wealth. Meanwhile, smaller parties such as Ukip, the SNP and the Greens are scrambling the traditional political allegiances, making this the most unpredictable - and uncontrollable - election anyone can remember.</p>
      <p>Already, the mainstream parties are rushing to the fringes bearing gifts. There has been gold for Scotland, following the independence referendum, frankincense for Northern Ireland with the power to vary corporation tax, and myrrh for Ukip over immigration. It cannot be long before someone produces some environmentally friendly silver for the Greens. Such opportunistic positioning is to be expected five months before the voters decide - all is fair in love, war and election campaigns. The worry, however, is that the informal jostling and dealmaking will become institutionalised in a fractured and divided House of Commons next May.</p>
      <p>Senior Tories are increasingly convinced that if Mr Cameron is the leader of the biggest party, but does not have an overall majority, he will aim to run a minority government rather than forming a coalition. His recent experience of policy disputes and political differentiation with the Lib Dems has tarnished his view of formal two-party administrations and friends say he is not minded to make another "bold and generous offer" if parliament is hung again. One ally says that, in any case, it's unlikely the Lib Dems would go into government with the Tories for a second time.</p>
      <p>As for other potential alliances, a Downing Street aide insists that Mr Cameron will "never, ever" form a coalition with Ukip. "A minority administration would be preferable to another coalition," says one insider. Already, the prime minister has begun wooing Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, inviting its eight MPs to a reception in the No 10 garden this year. As the Cameron children played among the guests, those present said he knows he may soon have to play the "Orange card" and rely on the support of these MPs in the Commons.</p>
      <p>There is a similar mood in the Labour party, with shadow cabinet members convinced that attempting to run a minority government Would be preferable to going into a formal coalition with the "tainted" Lib Dems. Although there has been an attempt to repair relations between the two parties, bad blood remains, with Mr Miliband openly contemptuous of Mr Clegg, who was portrayed as the "uncredible shrinking man" in a recent Labour election broadcast.</p>
      <p>The electoral system also means there is a strong possibility that Labour could win more seats but secure fewer votes than the Conservatives, and the Lib Dems could reduce their share of the vote at the same time as Ukip increases its support at the polls. That would create what one senior Lib Dem calls the "nightmare scenario" of a Lib-Lab pact portrayed as the "coalition of the losers".</p>
      <p>Although Labour could also turn to the Scottish nationalists, the SNP might be unwilling to go into government in Westminster with a party that remains its bitter rival in Scotland. More likely, insiders believe, would be some kind of a "confidence and supply" deal, with the smaller party or parties agreeing to support the larger one on votes of confidence and budget measures, but free to reserve judgment on other pieces of legislation.</p>
      <p>As society becomes ever more atomised, the political big tent is being replaced with a series of canvas micro-pods. This may be inevitable but there are consequences. It's disillusionment with the Westminster establishment that has led to the fracturing of politics - and yet the result in parliament is likely only to increase the reasons for cynicism. Individual MPs, including some of the more extremist ones, will become disproportionately influential.</p>
      <p>John Major suffered at the hands of his party's Eurosceptic "bastards", but it would be even harder for a prime minister, of any political persuasion, to deal with a clutch of MPs from a variety of smaller parties who held the balance of power. There would be huge pressure to strike seat-by-seat financial deals to get legislation through. However coded or couched, that would be a British version of pork-barrel politics. To call it anything else is putting lipstick on a pig.</p>

      <title>Why a club without a trophy for more than a decade are arguably the best</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The title of pound-for-pound champion is a peculiar thing. There is no belt or crown awarded to the holder, no tangible financial benefit. There are no bragging rights, either, considering all the experts in the world could never produce a standard formula for measuring who would come out on top if every boxer on the planet was shrunk or inflated to the same size and weight and then judged purely on ability.</p>
      <p>Yet the designation of the pound-for-pound champion is taken seriously enough by The Ring, the respected boxing magazine, for there to be a permanent list in existence. The most recent, published on January 14, had Floyd Mayweather Jr, the welterweight conqueror of Ricky Hatton, at No1, unsurprisingly considering his record of 39 undefeated contests and six world crowns at five weights.</p>
      <p>Joe Calzaghe, Britain's own super-middleweight, is fifth, his record of 44 unbeaten contests the most impressive of any boxer in the top ten. It could be argued that he deserved to be higher, which is perhaps the beauty of the pound-for-pound rankings. Because they are unquantifiable, all are subject to opinion. Nobody is right, nobody is wrong, but welcome to the debate nonetheless.</p>
      <p>In reality, Mayweather would get his clock cleaned by Wladimir Klitschko, a heavyweight champion, because of his 100lb weight, 10.6-inch height and 12.6 inch reach advantage, but that is only an accident of birth. The Ring's pound for-pound table is there to give an idea of who would be best were boxing handicapped, like horse racing. There is no equivalent of this in football, but if there were the Mayweather position could well go to Everton.</p>
      <p>Is there a better run, better managed, better value-for-money team in the Barclays Premier League? Is there a group of players giving more bang per buck, a team who could correlate their financial outlay and status with recent success and claim to be offering a superior return? Everton have not won anything of late, but who, beyond the elite four, has?</p>
      <p>If David Moyes, the manager, can inspire a victory over Chelsea at Goodison Park this evening, the club will advance on Wembley for the first time since 1995, and that alone would be a huge achievement in the modern climate. Since 2000-01, when the Champions League expanded to include 32 teams and threw a VIP cordon across each leading European league, only nine teams from outside the elite quartet of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool have reached the final of a domestic cup tournament (six in the League Cup, three in the FA Cup) and only two, Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers, have been victorious, both against teams outside the highest echelon.</p>
      <p>These days it is a sad fact that achievement levels require adjustment. Just reaching a final is success, for it is generally presumed that if a big club are there and care to win, they will.</p>
      <p>The same is true of league position. The days when Norwich City could sustain a place in the top three all season, as happened in 1992-93 when they went second in August, top in September and more or less remained there until dropping to third in February, where they finished, have gone.</p>
      <p>Everton may have won nothing for more than 12 years, but to judge them on an absence of domestic or European trophies is akin to claiming that a failure to take on bouts in the heavyweight division is a mark against Mayweather. There are other means of assessing Everton's progress and while it would be preposterous to attempt a definitive measurement, the present league position of fourth (above Liverpool by two points, although there is the matter of a game in hand) and final positions of fourth, eleventh and sixth since the 2004-05 season, represent sustained success at their level.</p>
      <p>It could be argued that Arsenal's resources when compared with those of United and Chelsea make the accomplishments under Arsene Wenger the best pound-for pound return, and maybe that was once true. Certainly in the years immediately after his arrival in 1996, Wenger pulled off a small footballing miracle, rejuvenating an ageing defence and importing players such as Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, who were turned into world-beaters by his methods.</p>
      <p>Yet Wenger began with certain advantages, too, not least the presence of the brilliant Dennis Bergkamp, who was by then accustomed to English football, having played a first season at Highbury under Bruce Rioch. Arsenal's status was another plus; they had a name and a reputation beyond these shores and were located in England's capital city. The club were always going to find it easier to attract leading players from abroad than the majority of rivals located in the provincial North.</p>
      <p>Indeed, within five years of Wenger's appointment, only financial restrictions held him back. His team were established as title contenders and regulars in the Champions League and since 2006 have played at a 60,000-capacity stadium that has cemented Arsenal's place as London's premier club, however many millions Roman Abramovich throws at Chelsea. The Emirates Stadium is a place where good players want to appear, making Arsenal one of the most attractive propositions in club football with financial clout that will continue improving.</p>
      <p>So while there was a time when Arsenal may have laid claim to the pound-for pound title, right now the club perform precisely as they should. With a vast stadium, an outstanding manager, an established team and a sustained record of success, Arsenal should expect to be pushing United all the way, and are.</p>
      <p>Everton enjoyed finite success, too, unfortunately at around the same time as other 1980s relics, including Bronski Beat, Five Star and Swing Out Sister, and much as for Jimmy Somerville, any kudos that may have accrued from the golden years between 1984 and 1987 has long since faded. Indeed, even at the apex of achievement, Everton did not enjoy the cachet of Arsenal or United, given a position as the second team on Merseyside and the third in the North West. Just as Manchester City's last league title win was overshadowed by United's triumph in the European Cup in 1968, so Everton's hopes of European domination were brought to an end by the ban on English clubs that followed the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.</p>
      <p>In the period when Everton won the FA Cup, the Cup Winners' Cup and two league titles, Liverpool reached two European Cup finals, winning one. Even when Everton were at their strongest, then, if there was a straight fight for a player in the transfer market they would have found it hard to see off Liverpool. And if that was the case 20 years ago, it is doubly true now.</p>
      <p>Circumstances dictate that Moyes operates in the most volatile arena of all, the second tier of transfer opportunities, a place in which prices are relatively high but a return cannot be guaranteed. Pay £ 26.5million for Fernando Torres, as Liverpool did, and the buyer knows what he is getting: one of the most consistent goalscorers in La Liga with a serious record in domestic and international football. That is not the case when Moyes spends £ 1.5million on Tim Cahill from Millwall or £ 2million on Mikel Arteta from Real Sociedad. Even some of his top-end signings such as Joleon Lescott, at £ 5million from Wolverhampton Wanderers, or the hefty £ 11.25million invested in bringing Yakubu Ayegbeni from Middlesbrough, qualify as huge gambles for a club with reduced resources.</p>
      <p>As Kevin Keegan is surely about to discover at Newcastle United, it is hard for an ambitious club to make headway given the many disparities in the modern game. Between fourth and fifth place hides a glass ceiling. There was a time when a club of Everton's standing might hope to hang on to a player such as Wayne Rooney long enough for him to make a difference; in the modern climate he was sold to Manchester United after two seasons at the age of 18.</p>
      <p>From Tranmere Rovers, maybe, the haste would be understandable, but Everton? All the advantages are with the establishment now. In 2005, when Everton made it into the Champions League, the co-efficient rankings ensured a difficult tie with Villarreal, of Spain, who went on to reach the last four.</p>
      <p>The much-vaunted reforms of Michel Platini, the Uefa president, do fresh contenders from the leading leagues few favours, either, consigning them to play off against each other and making it even harder for an inexperienced club to gain entry to the competition. By keeping the co-efficient system in place, however, Platini has further cemented the grip of the elite. No wonder the biggest of Uefa's regulars did not complain about his proposals for long.</p>
      <p>This evening, Everton will play Chelsea, a club who have the jump on them in every field imaginable, from geographical to financial. If Chelsea truly desire a place in the Carling Cup final it will be hard to stop them and another year will pass without a trophy at Goodison. That is the way it is these days. Some may say that Everton have failed, but in essence they have been let down by the system. Pound for pound, Moyes could have the best team in the country and it is to football's shame that a fat lot of good it may do him.</p>

      <title>Pizza seller, dog carer, psychiatrist ... novelist</title>
      <subtitle>An unusual CV has culminated in Joanna Cannon writing the bestseller The Trouble with Goats and Sheep, says Fiona Wilson</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Before Haruki Murakami was a novelist, he worked in a record store. Before Kurt Vonnegut wrote Slaughterhouse Five he was the manager of a Saab car dealership. Harper Lee was a reservations clerk at an airline; Franz Kafka worked in insurance and JD Salinger was a soldier and worked on a cruise ship. To write a good novel, you might conclude, you need to have some life under your belt. Joanna Cannon has that in abundance.</p>
      <p>Cannon, 47, is a raven-haired psychiatrist whose CV has as many twists and turns as her first novel The Trouble With Goats and Sheep. Last week her 1970s whodunnit about two young girls who try to solve the mystery of their neighbour's disappearance, shot straight into the Top Ten bestsellers list, which is otherwise occupied by big hitters such as Julian Barnes and Paula Hawkins.</p>
      <p>Cannon has written a book that should strike a chord with many readers: it's about outsiders and how judgmental we can be towards people who are "different" - something she witnessed every day in her work. But it was when she watched news reports fingering landlord Christopher Jefferies for the murder of the Bristol landscape architect Joanna Yeates in 2010 that she really started thinking. "It brought home to me how judgmental we are of people and what strange criteria we use to decide whether somebody is acceptable or not. It was frightening, the amount of media attention and public outrage Jefferies received purely based on what he looked like," she says. "And then you find out it's some 'ordinary' upstanding member of the community that actually murdered her. That stuck in my head."</p>
      <p>This idea of blending in and being one of society's sheep or sticking out as a goat is at the heart of her own tale, which takes place during the heatwave of 1976. In a Midlands cul-de-sac something happens that gets all the curtains twitching: Mrs Creasy from Number 8 goes missing and the socially awkward Walter Bishop is accused of the crime. Ten-year-old Grace and her fragile friend Tilly decide to investigate for themselves and uncover secrets behind every door. Of course, all is not what it seems.</p>
      <p>Cannon has come down to London for the day from her hometown of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, where she lives with her dog Seth. It's the eve of her novel's publication and she's barely slept, though you wouldn't know it unless she told you. "I love coming to London but I suffer with sensory overload when I come here," she says. "The next day I have a London hangover."</p>
      <p>Anyone who has made an excuse about not having enough time to write should take a leaf out of Cannon's book: she woke up at 3am every morning to write and spent her lunchtimes sitting in a variety of NHS car parks getting down more thoughts. Before long, she had written 30,000 words of The Trouble With Goats and Sheep. She joined the WoMentoring Project, a free literary mentoring scheme, and put herself up for the literary equivalent of The X Factor, where she had to read 500 words in front of a panel of literary bigwigs. She won the competition and within days seven agents had offered to represent her. In January last year, the Borough Press bought the book for a "high five-figure" sum. "I thought, 'This is a Richard Curtis film, this is not real life.' It still seems strange that people read it. I feel like they've been inside my head."</p>
      <p>Cannon has lived in Ashbourne, at the edge of the Peak District, her whole life and she has no plans to leave. She has a partner, who she has "been with for years" but he isn't into reading and "hasn't read the bloody book yet". Her path to becoming a doctor wasn't a usual one: she left her local school aged 15 with one O level in French ("I did it a year early and got an A so I left on a high") before working as a secretary, a bartender in a motorway pub, a kennel maid at an animal rescue centre, a "pizza delivery expert" and a perfume saleswoman. She wanted a new challenge, which led her, in a roundabout way, to taking a first-aid course. And a challenge was what she got. When she told the paramedic in charge that she wished she could have been a psychiatrist but she felt she was too old to go to medical school, he told her she wasn't. "And because I go hell-forleather on anything, I called up my local college and asked about A levels."</p>
      <p>Weeks later she was studying chemistry and biology, and applying to medical school with nothing but predicted grades, which "aren't worth the paper they're written on". In spite of this she got an interview at Leicester and they offered her a place. She saved money by living with her parents and delivering pizzas to pay for her textbooks.</p>
      <p>"I like trying new things," she says, with typical understatement. "What drove me was people thinking that I wasn't going to be able to do it. That I'd never stick five years of training. I can't bear people telling me I'm incapable of something." It's a philosophy that has stood her in good stead. Anyway, she'd seen it all at the pub and nothing shook her, not post mortems or carrying people's bowels across a theatre. Then she saw her first birth. "It's the only time I've felt my legs go," she says. The first time she delivered a child was the first time she had held a baby - not that she told the mother.</p>
      <p>Writing was her outlet as she worked her way through the wards. Then in 2014, when she was qualified as a psychiatrist and working on a high-dependency unit, she decided to give herself a year to see how far her writing could take her. Pretty far, as it turns out.</p>
      <p>Cannon is taking time off work to publicise the book and to write her second, about old age. The distance has made her feel more willing to "wave [her] flag above the parapet" about the plight of doctors. Of the junior doctors' strikes she says: "It's not striking but failing to strike that will put patients at risk. It's an unspoken rule that you don't hand over jobs to the next shift. Many junior doctors stay so late, it's almost time for them to start the next shift. On a night shift, you are looking after 100 to 200 patients, with a registrar who is almost always either in theatre or busy in A&amp;E. It's the most isolating and stressful feeling I have ever experienced."</p>
      <p>Like the mental health nurse Nathan Filer, whose Costa award-winning novel The Shock of the Fall raised awareness about mental illness, she feels that literature can be a powerful way of helping people to understand their own and others' problems. "If one person finds they can open up about how they're feeling and a book inspired them to have that courage, that's incredible."</p>
      <p>When she looks at how much her life has changed in the past couple of years, she is amazed. "My biggest aim in life was to do psychiatry, but I thought I had missed my opportunity. The writing I did for pleasure and all of this" - she waves her hands in the air - "has happened by chance. You have to dare to fail sometimes." She's a long way from that.</p>

      <title>Pianist Lynne Arriale shuns pyrotechnics to find the poetry in the music. Clive Davis meets a rising star</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Though it may be hard to believe, Lynne Arriale was a late starter in jazz. Until she was about 24 her life revolved around classical piano. It's no great surprise to learn that her heart lay with the Romantics.</p>
      <p>Jazz played no part in her upbringing in Wisconsin. The family record collection consisted of the classics and show tunes ("When I was very young I wouldn't take a nap unless My Fair Lady was playing"). It was only while she was studying for her master's at the state's Conservatory of Music that she became aware of a different sound. She remembers hearing a Dave Brubeck record and admiring the solo by Brubeck's saxophonist Paul Desmond.</p>
      <p>Even though she had enjoyed toying with melodies even as a child, the idea of improvising over chord changes was an utter mystery.</p>
      <p>But Arriale has made up for lost time. So many of the pianists to come out of the music schools in recent years have had the makings of athletes rather than artists; Arriale has a touch of the poet about her. Just as it was said that the great saxophonist Lester Young always kept in mind the words of a tune he was playing, her music combines depth with a song-like purity. Song and singing play a crucial role in her music. What matters, for her, is the inner voice. The question she poses both to her students and to herself, time and again, is a simple one: "Are you playing what you are singing, or singing what you are playing?"</p>
      <p>Her latest album, Inspiration, finds her paying homage to the musicians and songwriters who have nourished her art. It makes a typically adventurous set. Thelonious Monk, Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea all have their moments, but the programme also takes a detour into America from West Side Story, not forgetting Lennon and McCartney's Blackbird and Bacharach's A House is not a Home.</p>
      <p>One of Arriale's great strengths - along with her telepathic relationship with the drummer Steve Davis and bassist Jay Anderson - is her scrupulous attention to detail. "Repertoire is so important," she explains. A player can be a great soloist but if he doesn't have the material he can go only so far.</p>
      <p>"The concept behind Inspiration is the idea of taking a breath. Every time we take a breath that air becomes a part of us. What you play reveals who you are. One of my students was playing for me recently, and I noticed that he kept playing a certain chord. When I asked him why, he said he thought it was more hip than a seventh. We have to try to get away from the idea of what is hip. It's like asking whether green is more hip than blue."</p>
      <p>Arriale moved to New York after finishing her studies in Wisconsin and began working her way up the hierarchy of venues. It took her a decade to arrive at her own style, she says. After a series of promising early albums for the DMP label, she switched to the Swiss company TCB. One highlight was a fine live album recorded at the Montreux Festival in 1999.</p>
      <p>She cites Keith Jarrett's Standards Trio as her biggest influence. "A lot of players make a point of sounding like other musicians," Arriale says. "When I heard the Jarrett trio for the first time I thought: 'Oh, he's doing something different. It's almost as if, wherever he drops his fingers, he's going to play something beautiful.'</p>
      <p>"To try to imitate that wouldn't make sense. It's like saying you want someone's personality. What I tried to do was to be quiet and wait for the melodies to come to me."</p>
      <p>There is a curious postscript to all this. It was only after she had embarked on her path as a jazz musician that she made an intriguing discovery about her roots. Aware that she was adopted as a baby, she tracked down her biological mother who, it turned out, had once worked as a jazz singer in Milwaukee. Like Arriale, she also had perfect pitch. Life had come full circle.</p>
      <p>The Lynne Arriale Trio appears at the Pizza Express Jazz Club, W1 (020-7439 8722), tomorrow to March 3. Inspiration is on the TCB label</p>

      <title>How a Gen Z Kennedy joined Jared Kushner's Covid team</title>
      <subtitle>The US president's 'task force' was a group of 20-year-old volunteers with no experience, a new documentary asserts - and it was a Kennedy who blew the whistle. Will Pavia reports</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Fresh out of Harvard, Max Kennedy Jr knocked around at consulting and finance companies. He was prepping for law school when coronavirus halted all civilised life in the United States, down to its lowest and murkiest depths.</p>
      <p>Even the law school admissions exam was cancelled.</p>
      <p>Then he got a call from an old boss. "He'd heard that Jared Kushner's task force needed volunteers who had general skills and were willing to work seven days a week for no money," Kennedy says in Totally Under Control, a new documentary chronicling how America handled the pandemic. It is co-directed by Alex Gibney, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2006 for Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, the story of one of the worst corporate scandals in US history.</p>
      <p>Kennedy, 26, has reddish rumpled hair, a square jaw and an expression of such earnestness that I started to wonder if he was a member of the Kennedy political dynasty, a relative of the politician Joe Kennedy III, who appears in a scene interrogating a Trump official in Congress. The film's directors don't tell you, but it turns out that they are cousins and grandchildren of Bobby Kennedy. Max balked at the thought of working for Kushner, Donald Trump's aide and son-in-law, but it was an emergency. "I felt like the country and the world were under attack," he says, and one can almost hear his greatuncle Jack telling Americans to ask what they can do for their country. By late March the coronavirus was rampant, hospitals were running out of supplies and it was becoming clear that something called the strategic national stockpile wasn't strategic, national or very much of a stockpile. On April 2 a nation turned its frightened eyes to the Coronavirus Task Force Briefing where the vice-president, Mike Pence, described this new volunteer force that Kushner had assembled as "a working group … that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation and around the world".</p>
      <p>Kushner apparently did nothing to dispel the idea that a crack squad of supply chain specialists were now at work. The president wanted "to make sure we're finding all the best thinkers in the country", he said. They were going to move fast, "break barriers" and "think outside the box".</p>
      <p>As Kennedy tells it, it was a farce. The team was given a day to get to the Washington DC HQ of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). In a windowless conference room in the basement, Kennedy says, they were given a pep talk by a representative from Fema and a representative from the military. They talked about "the stuff", Kennedy says. "They said, 'There is stuff all around the world, there is stuff in the US and we need to get it to hospitals as fast as possible.' " Then the top brass filed out of the room. "The only people left were the volunteers," Kennedy says. "We thought we would be auxiliary support for an existing procurement team that just needed to be expanded as quickly as possible. Instead, we were the team." The richest country in the world was leaning on a group of "about ten 20-year-old volunteers, just with private laptops, no industry relationships, no experience".</p>
      <p>They began by thinking of friends or colleagues who knew people in China, finding the addresses of factories and making contact using their personal Gmail accounts. "Because we had never done this before there were all these really basic questions about how a federal procurement operation should work," he says. "We would call factories and say, 'We think the federal government can send you a cheque in 60 days,' and they would say, 'There is someone with a briefcase of cash and they are offering to pay me right now.' We would run around the Fema building looking for someone who could tell us what payment terms the federal government was allowed to offer … No one ever told us."</p>
      <p>Kennedy would eventually send an anonymous whistleblower's complaint to Congress. He says the directors of Totally Under Control reached him through a mutual acquaintance and persuaded him to go public. They tried for other task force members too, but all had been made to sign non-disclosure agreements, and having seen what happened to other public officials who spoke out, "They are scared," Suzanne Hillinger, one of the film's three directors, tells me. In Max's case, perhaps, it might have helped that he was a Kennedy.</p>
      <p>I speak to the three directors - Hillinger, Ophelia Harutyunyan and Gibney - on a Zoom call. Gibney thinks that the volunteer force fiasco exemplifies the White House response to the pandemic. Trump portrays large parts of the federal bureaucracy as the "deep state", a reservoir of resistance to his policies. During the pandemic it came to include scientists at public health agencies. There was also the conviction "that began with Reagan, that government is not the solution - it's the problem", he says.</p>
      <p>In their film Kennedy recalls that "the whole philosophy of the task force was that … the private market could quickly settle this issue. It was only once they had tried and failed that they started to blame other people."</p>
      <p>Trump began saying that the states were responsible for the shortfall. Kennedy says he heard higher-ups on the task force "talking about the president, saying, 'Love him or hate him, he's a marketing genius. He came up with the strategy to blame the states because the federal government isn't able to do this effectively.' " Kushner, whom no one describes as a marketing genius, then went before the microphones to declare, "The notion of the federal stockpile is that it's supposed to be our stockpile. It's not supposed to be states' stockpiles that they then use."</p>
      <p>The statement was baffling. What was America but a union of states? Who was he talking about when he said "our", reporters asked.</p>
      <p>State governors found themselves bidding against each other for medical supplies. It was like being on eBay, Andrew Cuomo, New York's governor, complained. "And then Fema gets involved and Fema starts bidding," he exclaimed. "Fema is driving up the price. What sense does this make?" One of the most shocking suggestions in Totally Under Control is that price gouging was all part of the plan. What supplies Kennedy's group found were flown back to the US, but the job of distributing the goods was given to five US companies that could sell it for any price they liked.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration thought "that private markets would be the most equitable way to decide on distribution", Gibney says. "In the middle of a pandemic it's really the looniest idea."</p>
      <p>They also allege that Trump traded special assistance for political favours. They say that when Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, sought federal assistance, he was required to make a public statement thanking the president. Hillinger says that they learnt this "from a source that was on the phone call with Newsom's team".</p>
      <p>Past presidents have boosted their reputations by helping disaster-struck states. I mention the pictures of Barack Obama almost embracing the Republican governor Chris Christie during his visit to hurricane-ravaged New Jersey in the build-up to the 2012 election. "I think Trump just takes it to such an exaggerated state," Gibney says. "We tried hard to get governors to talk to us on the record, but they were all extremely reticent. They were afraid that Trump would take revenge on their state." And Trump often boasts of how the governors have praised him. "We have done a 'phenomenal' job, according to certain governors," he said in a recent tweet.</p>
      <p>Filming began in May, following strict coronavirus safety protocols.</p>
      <p>The cinematographer would set up the camera in a hotel room or home or wherever they were shooting, then withdraw behind it into a sealed tent so that when the subjects came in "they were not sharing the same air", Hillinger says. The directors remained at home - Gibney in New Jersey, Harutyunyan and Hillinger in Brooklyn - and interviewed subjects on a screen above the camera.</p>
      <p>They begin their coronavirus story in early 2020 when Trump was busy assuring America that it was merely an invention of his political opponents. "This is their new hoax," he told supporters. "It will go away, just stay calm. We have it totally under control. It's going to be just fine."</p>
      <p>Gibney says it "feels like ancient history, but it's important history". The film traces the efforts by public health experts to warn the president, as well as catastrophic delays in the effort to develop a working test for the virus, the failure of the White House to speed things up and Trump's apparent fear that acknowledging the threat would damage the buoyant economy that was to be a central part of his re-election campaign.</p>
      <p>When a public health official declared in late February that "it's not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses", causing the stock market to plummet, Trump was furious; she was swiftly sidelined.</p>
      <p>Totally Under Control does not break any news, but it joins the dots and you see a big picture, albeit one that does not always make sense. Take Mike Bowen, one of the last remaining producers of N95 masks in America. He says that for years he had tried to warn the Obama administration that this could be a problem during a pandemic. "I voted for Donald Trump," he says in the film. "I thought, 'I know, if I contact enough people in the administration … one of these people is going to look at this.' " In January he tried harder: if they would put in the orders now, there was still time to activate manufacturing lines that could make enough masks for health workers. He was ignored. He recalls watching Trump in the Oval Office later that spring, listening as a nurse says, brightly, that some of her colleagues had learnt to make do without enough protective gear. "I heard the opposite," Trump says. "I have heard that they are loaded up with gowns now."</p>
      <p>Bowen says: "I turned to my wife and said, 'That's complete bullshit. He has no idea what he's talking about.' " Later we see him testifying, tearfully, before Congress, about the hundreds of calls he gets, the orders he can't fill. "I can't help these people," he says.</p>
      <p>Bowen was ignored, then watched, with mounting bewilderment, as masks somehow became a partisan issue. Meanwhile, in upstate New York, a doctor named Vladimir Zelenko, who had started trying the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine on his patients, uploaded a YouTube video addressing the president. "The next day his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, called me," he says. Shortly after that he received a call from the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Trump began taking it and public health officials came under intense pressure to approve it as a potential miracle drug even when the evidence was shaky. Trump dismissed one study as having been conducted by scientists who "aren't big Trump fans".</p>
      <p>"It shows how Trump is running his government," Hillinger says. "He's going to take advice from anyone he wants to."</p>
      <p>They finished the film at the beginning of this month. Gibney went to bed, exhausted. "I was sleeping soundly," he says. "At 2am I got a call." It was a producer, calling him to say that Trump had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Trump catching the virus he had decried as a hoax "had a certain sardonic poetry to it", he says. They debated whether to call the film back and insert new scenes, but the events just kept on coming. "We would still be going crazy," he says.</p>
      <p>They had begun it in a metropolis crippled by the virus. Hillinger had been ill with it. "A friend of mine died from Covid," Gibney says. "Another friend was two weeks on a ventilator and survived, to the great applause of the staff at the hospital."</p>
      <p>Their film is all about "the tension between politics and science", Gibney says. "If there is a hope that I have it's that we regain that confidence in listening to the science rather than the politics."</p>
      <p>Totally Under Control will be released in the UK and Ireland in select cinemas and on digital on October 23</p>

      <p>Outcasts United: A Refugee Team, an American Town by Warren St John</p>
      <p>Fourth Estate, £14.99 £13.49; 320pp</p>
      <p>Shamsoun Dikori remembered the first time that he saw aircraft high above the Nuba Mountains in central Sudan. He thought that they were birds - until the bombs came raining down. Jihad followed the bombings; within two years about 200,000 people (20 per cent of the local population) had been killed and the survivors of the 50 or so ethnic groups that inhabited this fertile region had been displaced.</p>
      <p>A tortuous journey ensued for Dikori's family, his parents and his two brothers and three sisters: makeshift villages in the mountains, peace camps, Khartoum and then Cairo until, finally, the UN refugee office there told them that they had been accepted for relocation to the US, where they ended up in Clarkston, Georgia.</p>
      <p>The children enrolled in school, their father got a job, saved enough to buy a Mazda van and shortly before Thanksgiving in 2002, two years after they had settled in America, they took off on a trip to Tennes-seto visit other Sudanese refugees. But Dikori's family never made it. The van crashed on Interstate 24 and Dikari's mother and three sisters were killed.</p>
      <p>What helped Dikari and his younger brothers, Robin and Idwar, to keep their sanity in the months and years after this traumatic episode was football - more precisely, football for a team called the Fugees (as in refugees - the same source as for the hip-hop group of that name), run by a remarkable pair of women: Luma Mufleh, the coach, and Tracey Ediger, who is the manager-cum-general factotum. "It kept our minds from thinking what happened," Dikari says. "We made friends ... it broadened our minds and we realised we weren't the only ones going through hard times. That is why the team is so close. It became our family."</p>
      <p>The remarkable story of this football family has now been told by Warren St John, a reporter from The New York Times who immersed himself in the immigrant footballing community of Clarkston. Like all good books about sport, this is about much more than sport. It is about how the inhabitants of Clarkston came to terms, or did not come to terms, with a decade during which their town changed beyond recognition; about how immigrants coped with the kind of upheaval most people cannot imagine, and about how sport helped, to a small extent, to ameliorate the process for both.</p>
      <p>Until the last two decades of the 20th century not much happened in Clarkston. It was a typical town in the American South, mainly white and conservative and happily so, if its proximity to Stone Mountain, for many years the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan and scene of cross burnings as late as the 1980s, was anything to go by. Things changed when various refugee settlement programmes identified the town as a suitable place for relocation.</p>
      <p>In the previous census, nine years ago, only 20 per cent of the town's population was described as white, the rest being African-Americans, Asians, Hispanics, Somalis and a variety of refugee groups. The inside flap of Outcasts United has a picture of the under-13 squad. There are four players from Sudan (two of whom are Dikari's younger brothers), three from Liberia, two from the Democratic Republic of Congo and one each from Kosovo, The Gambia, Iraq, Bosnia and Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Sport has always been a friend to minor-itand disadvantaged groups because, for the most part, pure ability and talent smash falsely erected barriers. Jesse Owens did not do much for Hitler's theory of Aryan racial superiority with his haul of gold medals in the 1936 Berlin Games, nor did the right hand of Joe Louis in his 1938 rematch against Max Schmeling. Muhammad Ali's story was an inspiration to countless African-Americans and the spread of cricket in former British colonies can be understood only against a backdrop of the fight against imperialism. But it is only relatively recently that the power of sport has been harnessed in a more productive, organised and official way. Bodies such as Unicef recognise that sport is a "vital element in the health, happiness and wellbeing of children". For the United Nations, 2005 was the International Year of Sport and Physical Education, before which Kofi Annan, then the UN Secretary-General, endorsed its importance. "Sport is a universal language which can bring people together no matter what their origin, background, religious belief or economic status," he said.</p>
      <p>There are countless NGOs and charities using sport now to help to bring about positive change. Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, believes passionately in the ability of cricket to help to promote social cohesion and is president of the Chance to Shine appeal, which is helping to reintroduce cricket into state schools and inner-city communities. Cricket for Change is working in the West Bank, trying to bring Jews and Arabs together by playing a game that has no historical baggage for either.</p>
      <p>In Clarkston the catalyst for this process was not a powerful figure such as Annan or King, nor even a charitable foundation - it was an immigrant with no money, no job and few prospects. Lumah Mufleh was from a relatively prosperous Jordanian family until she decided to move to the US and was cut off by her relatives. She then followed a well-trodden immigrant path, washing dishes, cleaning toilets, doing odd jobs, hitting dead ends and enduring bankruptcy. Then one day she saw a group of refugees playing ball on a piece of scrub land and she found her vocation.</p>
      <p>She became more than a football coach for these shattered lives. She became a surrogate mother, friend, hairdresser, teacher, social worker, nurse, disciplinarian, fundraiser and politician, fighting as she had to every step of the way against the Mayor of Clarkston, Lee Swaney, who refused to let immigrants or football spoil the town's one lush green field. It was as a coach, though, that her special qualities clearly lay: irascible, intractable, sure of her methods and not prepared to bend her rules for anyone. Sir Alex Ferguson in a skirt.</p>
      <p>Gradually, through the friendships, kinship, healthy competition and feelings of self-worth that playing and occasionally winning with the Fugees brought, these immigrant children came to realise that they could forge a new life in America.</p>
      <p>The majority in Clarkston found it harder to accept the new realities, but odd things began to happen. Thriftown, the local supermarket run by Bill Mehlinger, was about to go broke when one of his workers, who was Vietnamese, suggested that he started to stock more exotic foods, especially since the nearest outlet for Vietnamese food was a half-hour drive away. The supermarket began to thrive again. "If you don't change, you're gone," Mehlinger says.</p>
      <p>The Clarkston Baptist Church, whose numbers had begun to drop, renamed itself the Clarkston International Bible Church and began to hum again on Sundays. "I tell them, 'America is changing'," says the pastor, Phil Kitchin, " 'Get over it.' " The Clarkston police force took on a black man as chief of police and the relationships between the immigrant community and the police quickly improved after he insisted that all residents of Clarkston be treated with courtesy, respect and professionalism.</p>
      <p>St John quotes the work of a British academic, Steven Vertovec, who has written about the interaction between new inhabitants and old in towns that are affected by what he calls "super-diversity". In essence, his thesis is that re-categorisation of a town's population is needed, not along racial lines, but by all the affiliations that people might have, whether that is a love of sport, the arts or whatever. Gradually these affiliations or enthusiasms will overlap and individuality, rather than broad categorisation, emerges. This book would seem to bear this analysis out, and would be helpfully placed in the library of every British town where mass immigration is translating into votes for the British National Party.</p>
      <p>This is a marvellous story, all the more moving for being written straight by a talented reporter. There are no fairytale end-ingsno neat tie-ups: players come and go and occasionally fall out with the coach and don't return. The Fugees occasionally let themselves down; they win some, they lose some. Mufleh the coach, a saintly heroic presence for much of the book, also has an ego the size of Texas.</p>
      <p>Clarkston doesn't become a beacon of racial tolerance overnight: in 2008 a 23-year-old Somali refugee was beaten to death during a basketball game. Equally, St John tries hard to understand the difficulties faced by inhabitants of a town that has changed utterly. Mayor Swaney is not portrayed simply as a rednecked racist.</p>
      <p>Despite this (and don't hold your breath that Universal Studios, which has bought the rights, won't simplify a complex situation) it is clear that something remarkable has happened and it is clear that sport has played its part in this. George Orwell was disparaging of sport's ability to change things for the better, it being nothing more, he wrote, than "war minus the shooting".</p>
      <p>"What makes people join a gang?" MuflehaskedtheFugeesoneday.</p>
      <p>"Race," one said.</p>
      <p>"Money," another said. "Protection," another said. "To be cool," another said. "To be men," yet another said. "So what makes a gang different from the Fugees?" she asked.</p>
      <p>"They fight," and "They shoot each other," were the replies.</p>
      <p>Being "war minus the shooting" is, and always has been, sport's greatest justification: for once you take the shooting out of war you no longer have war.</p>

      <title>Girl power in the old West</title>
      <subtitle>Cover story With True Grit, the macho terrain of the western has a new star - a 14-year-old girl, says Kate Muir</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>"People do not give it credence that a 14-year-old girl could leave home and go off in the winter to avenge her father's blood," says Mattie Ross in the opening words of both the Coen Brothers' film and the Charles Portis novel True Grit. Immediately, Mattie is established as a heroine with a determined, censorious streak and a raw lust for revenge, all the more surprising in a young lady of the 19th century. And when that character is transferred to the screen in the 21st century, she becomes a box-office sensation, in the form of Hailee Steinfeld.</p>
      <p>In True Grit, Steinfeld manages to do the impossible: upstage Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon - rather accomplished actors, you'll agree. In every shot, the eye is drawn to Mattie, the essence of American Gothic with her long brown plaits under her dead father's hat. She speaks in ornate language straight from the Scriptures - "The wicked flee when none pursueth" - and is also unintentionally funny in her earnestness. Bridges and Damon are man enough to take the cinematic whipping from the kid, though in the initial stages of the movie it is Mattie who gets spanked by Damon. Then he realises who's boss.</p>
      <p>It's the 1870s. Mattie is sent to Fort Smith, Arkansas, with a servant to pick up her dead father's body and finds that no one is bothering to search for his killer, the drunken wastrel Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). Mattie immediately hires Rooster Cogburn (a piratical Bridges) for the job: "He is a pitiless man, double-tough, and fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork." Soon Ranger LaBoeuf (a Rooster is accompanied by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (a mustachioed Damon). At first they refuse to have the girl along, but Mattie wants to make sure that she's getting her money's worth. Refused passage by a ferry, she rides her black pony into a river to catch up with the two men. Their attitude moves slowly from irritated acceptance to grudging respect.</p>
      <p>"She is a pill [a pain]," Ethan Coen told The New York Times, "but there is something deeply admirable about her in the book that we were drawn to. The whole Presbyterian-Protestant ethic in a 14-year-old girl was interesting to us and sounded fun." Joel Coen added: "We didn't think we should mess around with what we thought was a very compelling story and character."</p>
      <p>The Coen Brothers went back to the original 1968 novel, with its crisp, deadpan humour, for their movie and ignored John Wayne's traditional 1969 version, with the 22-year-old Kim Darby as Mattie. The Coens' version is more miniaturist than most westerns - no widescreen Sergio Leone operatics - and the characters take precedence. But American audiences have rushed to see the film, and word-of-mouth meant that it outdid the mega-budget Little Fockers and Gulliver's Travels at Christmas. The arthouse Coens had, to their surprise, made a funny holiday movie, a far cry from their No Country for Old Men, a western from hell.</p>
      <p>The upstart True Grit got noticed and has been nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Film, Best Actor (again) for Bridges and Best Supporting Actress for Steinfeld. At 13 years old, she had been picked from 15,000 hopefuls, with little experience but for bit parts and K-Mart adverts. But Steinfeld seems wise beyond her years and brings the required Presbyterian gravitas to the part. Mattie is brave to the point of insanity, thanks to her innocence. She watches three men hang in a public square in the initial scenes; lacking a bed, she sleeps the night with corpses at the undertakers; and she takes up her father's old hat, coat and gun. Severed fingers and corpses leave her almost unmoved - she has business to complete.</p>
      <p>Mattie is an early feminist western heroine, not of the Calamity Jane sharp-shooting sort, or a brawling bar-room madam, but someone who relies on her brains, mathematical skills and sharp tongue to take advantage of others' brawn. Perhaps the heroine she matches most closely is another of this year's Oscar nominees, Jennifer Lawrence, in Winter's Bone, whose character walks out into the badlands of the Ozarks to find what happened to her murdered father. Mattie is also as fearless and idiosyncratic as that other 13-year-old gunslinger, Chloë Moretz as Hit Girl in Kick-Ass. Perhaps indomitable frontier girl spirit is suddenly in fashion. Coming soon is Meek's Cutoff, based on the grim diaries of pioneering women on the Oregon trail and starring Michelle Williams.</p>
      <p>The Coen brothers, true to Portis's novel, manage to incorporate this child bent on Old Testament-style revenge into the traditional pleasures of the western. Rooster Cogburn is a classic charater. Bridges slurs Rooster's speech with whiskey and general wear and tear. But his laconic, world-weary modus operandi is tossed aside when he goes into action against four enemy riders: the Dude takes his reins in his teeth, cocks a pistol in each hand and rides flat out into their faces. No CGI here, just darn good balance.</p>
      <p>Of course, this would not be a Coen film without a certain disturbing weirdness, and the landscape of Oklahoma's Indian Territory is bleak, washed-out and wintry. When a man is found hanging on a tree, he seems to have been hoisted 50ft, as the carrion crows peck. A man rides in, dressed entirely in a bearskin, like a mythical creature, and carries off the corpse because he is "a dentist" and might find the teeth useful. The little touches of gothic horror make Mattie's implacability all the more amusing.</p>
      <p>Mattie employs Rooster when she hears that he has "true grit", but it is soon clear that she is the grittier character, with the added force of righteousness on her side. Mattie lays down the law: "No doubt Chaney fancies himself scot-free. But he was wrong. You must pay for everything in this world, one way or another. There is nothing free except the grace of God." Mattie is, as someone says, "no bigger than a corn nugget". But be afraid. Be very afraid.</p>
      <p>True Grit is on general release from Friday</p>

      <p>STANDARD LIFE saw off the carpetbaggers and now plans to put in place measures to prevent another assault on its mutual status. The insurer won the backing of 54.3 per cent of the 1.1 million members who voted, defeating a motion by Fred Woollard, an Australian fund manager, to force it to float. Standard Life members threw away potential windfalls of up to Pounds 6,000.</p>
      <p>A Pounds 77 billion merger of WorldCom and Sprint, the telecom companies failed as the US Government and the European Commission barred it because the group would have dominated Internet access.</p>
      <p>The Times reported that Deutsche Telekom was believed to be poised to bid Pounds 66 billion for Sprint. The two had merger talks last year, but Deutsche was beaten by WorldCom. Nearly Pounds 9.3 billion was wiped off the value of Deutsche's stock on expectations that the deal would involve shares rather than cash.</p>
      <p>Consumers went further into debt in May than in any previous month, fuelling fears that UK interest rates may go up again. Consumer credit grew by Pounds 1.6 billion, or 1.3 per cent, taking the annual rise to 14.5 per cent. The increase was steeper than the Pounds 1.3 billion average City forecast, and will strengthen hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee.</p>
      <p>Wall Street was hit by a wave of profit warnings, wiping a third from the value of Unisys, the IT group, and raising fears that corporate America's boom may be over. Between Tuesday and Thursday, at least 21 companies, including Goodyear, Del Monte Foods and Yahoo!, gave warning of disappointing profits or sales or exceptional charges.</p>
      <p>US interest rates were held as the Federal Open Market Committee was persuaded by recent data that the US economy is starting to cool.</p>
      <p>Hamleys, one of Britain's best-known toy retailers, was close to receiving an offer valuing it at Pounds 42 million from Charterhouse Development Capital, the venture capitalist that owns Madame Tussaud's and Alton Towers. Hamleys has issued four profit warnings in the past two years.</p>
      <p>William Baird won the right to pursue its court fight against Marks &amp; Spencer after its sacking by the troubled retailer last October - but only on the basis of a second, highly technical claim that will require a change of law to succeed. Baird sued M&amp;S in January for Pounds 53.6 million to help to compensate for Pounds 104 million in writedowns, including 4,500 redundancies.</p>
      <p>Smith &amp; Nephew said it is to return Pounds 415 million to investors in a radical overhaul. It will sell its consumer businesses for Pounds 235 million to focus on advanced medical products, and is cutting its dividend by a third to free funds to invest.</p>
      <p>Freeserve, the UK's biggest Internet company, saw Pounds 1.2 billion wiped off its value in two days as the City criticised its ending of merger talks with Germany's T-Online.</p>
      <p>Photo-Me, the photo booth operator, emerged at the centre of a complex list of related-party transactions.</p>
      <p>Charles Allen, chairman of Granada Media Group, proposed a merger with United News &amp; Media and Carlton Communications to create a Pounds 16 billion broadcasting powerhouse. He was revealing details of Granda Media's demerger from Granada Group and its flotation with a price tag of up to Pounds 6.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Corus, the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker, said that more job losses loom as it reported a Pounds 156 million half-year loss and blamed the strong pound for eroding profits.</p>
      <p>Trade union membership in Britain has risen for the first time in two decades amid escalating industrial action and labour market unrest. Despite tens of thousands of job losses, especially in the car and textile industries, analysis of Labour Force Survey figures by the TUC revealed a 100,000 strong increase in membership in the past year.</p>

      <title>The breast implants with a more natural look</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Tests using plastic with a softer texture are ready to start, reports Richard Irving</p>
      <p>A SCOTTISH company which started life by making replacement heart valves out of pig gut, is set to start testing a "next generation" breast implant made of ultra-tough but highly malleable plastic.</p>
      <p>AorTech International, based in Bellshill, said yesterday that it would start a full range of clinical tests on the implants after American health regulators approved the way in which prototypes had been manufactured and tested.</p>
      <p>The technology, which has been developed at a subsidiary in Australia, is based on a polymer called Elast-Eon. The plastic is extremely hard-wearing and resistant to tearing but far softer than existing implants, which will make for a more natural profile after surgery.</p>
      <p>The plastic, which is also highly resistent to any attempts by the body to break it down, was originally developed to insulate the wires on pacemakers. A harder version of the polymer will form the outer shell of the implant, while a softer variation will make the gel filler.</p>
      <p>Frank Maguire, the chief executive of AorTech, told The Times last night that the prototype would feel softer and more natural than the current range of high-density implants.</p>
      <p>"This is the next generation. It makes all the sense in the world to move forward with a new product that more naturally simulates breast tissue".</p>
      <p>He added that the feedback from US regulators was positive. Breast implants have been around since the 1960s, but their reliability has recently prompted fears over safety. Some devices have ruptured while the silicone gel in others has been found to leach through the outer skin of the device.</p>
      <p>US plastic surgeons have since moved over to saline-filled implants, but patients typically complain that the devices feel too artificial.</p>
      <p>Mr Maguire said that a prototype implant would be trialled in patients towards the middle of next year and that a final version of the device could be available by 2006.</p>
      <p>The chief executive said that the company was looking for a partner to help to develop and market the product, adding that he was anticipating entering into talks with America's two major breast implant manufacturers, Inamed and Mentor, over a possible joint partnership deal.</p>
      <p>The number of Britons undergoing plastic surgery has increased six fold in recent years fuelled mainly by a surge in requests for breast augmentation. According to a survey of members by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, about 10,700 cosmetic procedures were performed in 2003. The association, which boasts a relatively small membership of about 150 surgeons, estimates that breast augmentation accounted for more than 2,400 operations, or just under one in four of all procedures.</p>
      <p>However, the industry is fragmented and unregulated and the total number of breast augmentations performed last year in the UK could be as high as 110,000 -an increase of more than 80 per cent on 2002. With each treatment costing upwards of £4,000, the industry is worth close to £500 million a year.</p>
      <p>AorTech has suffered mixed fortunes since floating on the Alternative Investment Market, London's junior stock market in 1992. Its shares jumped to the equivalent of £103 in late 2000 after bankers highlighted the company as a possible takeover target. However, talks with a rival biosciences company collapsed and, following a refinancing of the company, the shares fell as low as 67p. The stock closed 3p higher last night at 175p.</p>
      <p>AorTech said in a statement that it was in talks with partners over 17 different possible uses for Elast-Eon, including a potential to use the polymer to build replacement spinal discs and heart valves.</p>

      <p>The course of true love never did run smooth. But if you are infatuated with a lawyer you have observed while serving on a jury, you may have a particularly rocky ride, as the High Court confirmed last month.</p>
      <p>At an inquest last year Leslie Thomas was the barrister acting for the family of Christopher Alder, who died in police custody. The jury ruled that there had been an unlawful killing. Five police officers challenged the verdict in the High Court on the ground that there was a real risk that the judgment of one juror, Claire Lintott, had been affected by her feelings for Mr Thomas. At first, Ms Lintott had thought Mr Thomas "arrogant". But hours after the inquest ended, they exchanged intimate text messages, she was "pleasantly surprised" by him when they met, and they spent three nights together, although (she insisted) "nothing sexual" occurred.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Jackson rejected the complaint that there was an appearance of bias. But he said that it was "inappropriate" for a barrister and a juror who have been involved in the same case "to embark on an interpersonal relationship so soon after the verdict". He suggested that such conduct "is liable to give rise to disquiet". Courtney Griffiths, QC, appearing in the High Court case for a third party, asserted that "everyone at the Bar agrees Mr Thomas showed gross lack of judgment".</p>
      <p>For those who consider barristers to be as exciting as a night with a volume of the All England Law reports, it may come as a surprise to learn that there are previous cases where jurors have been unable to resist the personal charms of counsel. In 1993 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against a conviction for unlawful wounding brought on the ground that, some days after the trial, a female member of the jury had sent a note to the male prosecuting counsel seeking "social contact with him in the form of lunch or a drink". The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that "she would have allowed her attention unduly to wander in court".</p>
      <p>In 1994 the Court of Appeal rejected a similar complaint in a murder case. After the acquittal of one of the defendants, a woman juror sent a note to his counsel asking him to join her for a drink and giving her home telephone number. The Court of Appeal did not accept that the feelings of the juror had worked to the disadvantage of the two convicted appellants. In 1996 the European Commission of Human Rights rejected a complaint that there had been a denial of the right to a fair trial.</p>
      <p>The US Courts of Appeal have come to similar conclusions. In 1980 the court dismissed a ground of appeal which asserted that during a trial a male juror was seen "blowing kisses, winking and waving" at the female prosecutor. In 1982 the court was unimpressed by the complaint that one of the male jurors wrote a love letter to the female prosecutor and invited her to lunch or dinner, enclosing "a picture of himself and a poem".</p>
      <p>Of course, a lawyer and a juror should not succumb to temptation before the end of the trial. In 1930 the Supreme Court of Washington decided permanently to disbar an attorney for going on a picnic with a female juror during the trial "to have illicit relations and satisfy their mutual desires", when he should have been concentrating on his closing speech. The court concluded that this was a dangerous liaison because it would inevitably have influenced the juror's assessment of the issues in the trial.</p>
      <p>But the situation considered by Mr Justice Jackson was very different. Mr Thomas had no personal contact with Ms Lintott before the inquest had finished. The judge did not say that barristers should follow a self-denying ordinance and refuse ever to date a woman (or man) who had sat on a jury in one of their cases. He suggested that no such relationship should begin "so soon after the verdict". But when it's over, it's over. If the relationship started after the case, it really doesn't matter whether it began one hour, one week or one month after Mr Thomas tied up his brief.</p>
      <p>Of course, the shorter the time gap between the hearing and the arrival of Cupid's arrow, the greater the risk that others will wrongly believe that the relationship started during the case. But the law of bias, and moral judgment, proceed by reference to the facts and logic, not erroneous suspicions. Whether or not Mr Thomas turned down Ms Lintott after the inquest ended could not affect her prior conduct as a juror. Are barristers supposed to make an application to a duty rota judge asking if it is too "soon" for intimacy and seeking an assurance that they will still command professional respect in the morning?</p>

      <p>Cardigan is the new location for downsizers, says Fred Redwood</p>
      <p>WHAT has been happening to Cardigan? It used to be just a holiday town with a pretty harbour -very charming, but far too remote to consider moving to. Yet figures show that people are now most certainly relocating to the West Wales town.</p>
      <p>Property prices rose by 8 per cent last year, and 44 per cent over the past three years, according to the Halifax.</p>
      <p>Why the sudden boom? "It's down to widespread use of the internet," says Richard Emanuel, of one local firm of estate agents, John Francis. "People buy into the dream of getting out of the rat race to find a better quality of life by the sea.</p>
      <p>The net brings the dream nearer. Buyers can see our house prices at the click of a mouse."</p>
      <p>The town has a lot to attract newcomers. There is a 1950s feel to the main street, with its family-run shops, many with their original frontages, and a proper cafe with waitresses. Market day, held on two levels in the Guildhall, is an interesting mix of indigenous locals and incomers. Welsh is spoken everywhere.</p>
      <p>Cardigan has good recreational amenities for a town of its size, too: there's a superb golf course, a recently revamped cinema, theatre, arts and entertainment centre (Theatr Mwldan), and a trendy-looking restaurant, the Royal India, in a converted boat.</p>
      <p>Christopher Burgess, a retired local government officer, is moving to Cardigan from Horsham, West Sussex. He and his wife, Heather, didn't confine their property search to Wales when looking for a retirement home. "We looked in Devon, Cornwall, Suffolk and Norfolk," he says. "We chose Cardigan because it is so much cheaper than the other areas." Burgess has bought a three-bedroom farmhouse, with three acres of land, for £ 330,000. He estimates that the same property, which is the conversion of four stone cottages into one, would have cost at least £ 750,000 in Sussex. It is typical of the kind of home that is popular in Cardigan.</p>
      <p>"Lifestyle properties are very popular," says Emanuel. "You'll pick up a three-bedroom farmhouse with ten acres of land for £ 350,000 to £ 400,000. People keep horses or use the land as a smallholding, sometimes also working from home. Smaller terraced properties are the most popular as holiday homes. You can buy a Victorian three-bed terraced house for less than £ 200,000."</p>
      <p>The town is good for sailing, as are many of the ports in the area. More than £ 1.1 million was recently invested in boating facilities on the River Teifi as part of an EU-supported project. Some 200 yards of pontoon has been installed, providing berthing for 30 further boats. There is also a new slipway in the town centre for trailer sailors and other small craft.</p>
      <p>However, it can't be denied that Cardigan is well away from the beaten track. If you are approaching from the east, via the M4, then you still have another hour to drive along country roads after the A48 peters out at St Clears, near Carmarthen.</p>
      <p>What was the overriding factor that prompted Burgess to sell up and move away from Sussex? "By moving, I could release some of the equity from my Sussex home and help my daughter to buy a house in London," he says. "I think house prices in the South East will prompt more parents in the same position as us to move to comparatively less expensive places such as Cardigan."</p>

      <title>The wives of prime ministers in this country have tended to imitate Victorian children in being seen but not heard</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>There is only one lesson to be learnt from last week's press hullabaloo over the timely lecture that Cherie Booth delivered drawing attention to the overcrowding in our prisons. That lesson has nothing to do with crime -or even the causes of crime. Instead it goes straight to the heart of the difficulty our newspapers still seem to experience in coming to terms with the fact that the wife of a prominent public figure may not merely possess, but actually have the right to express, independent views of her own.</p>
      <p>It is, to be blunt, an area where in this country we are pretty backward. The United States, after all, was brought face to face with the liberating presence of Eleanor Roosevelt -whose ideas, her husband FDR more than once declared, were entirely her own -some 70 years ago. And, though Laura Bush has caused no similar difficulty for the current US President, the American public has since Eleanor's death in 1962 lived through the equally liberating eras of Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton.</p>
      <p>In Britain, by contrast, the last century's prime ministers' wives tended to be modest, unassuming types (with only Clemmie Churchill, in her high-profile role as president of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund during the Second World War, providing the exception that proves the rule).</p>
      <p>But it could have easily been otherwise. Anyone with any memory of the post war Attlee Government has always known that a hidden but highly influential figure on its periphery was Dame Isobel Cripps, whose husband, Sir Stafford Cripps, not only wanted but tried to become Prime Minister in 1947.</p>
      <p>A strong character backed by the Eno's Fruit Salts fortune, Isobel Cripps acted, in effect, as the Alastair Campbell of her day. Every Friday afternoon when the House was sitting she would take tea with Hugh Massingham, the political columnist of The Observer, in a London hotel. Those who wondered why Massingham's "A London Diary" -as his regular column was called in The Observer -was so singularly well-informed only needed to learn about this weekly rendezvous in the Palm Court of the Ritz. Dame Isobel was, if you like, the very first Labour spin-doctor - like Alastair Campbell, totally dedicated to promoting the interests of one man, in this case her husband. Of course, this sort of loyalty placed her very much inside the party tent but that has by no means always been true of the spouses of leading political figures.</p>
      <p>Had, for example, Roy Jenkins ever reached No 10, the British public would have had to grow accustomed to the notion of an independent entity as a Prime Minister's wife before the arrival of the Blairs in 1997.</p>
      <p>Dame Jennifer Jenkins -a former chairman of both the Consumers' Association and the National Trust -may not, if only for generational reasons, quite measure up to the contemporary vision of "a working wife". Yet any idea that she did not rank as a career figure in her own right is plainly absurd. Had her husband become Prime Minister in 1976 -or, more likely, much earlier than that -Cherie Booth might well have escaped the fate of shocking the journalistic male psyche in the way that she plainly has.</p>
      <p>The awkward truth, however, is that for far longer than they need to have done the wives of prime ministers in this country have tended to imitate Victorian children in being seen but not heard. Husband-and-wife teams may nowadays sit alongside each other in the House of Commons -witness the Bottomleys and the Wintertons - but, while there may be equality at the bottom of the tree, there is virtually none at the top.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, exceptions can be made but, interestingly, they normally turn out to be cases in which the wife role is virtually invisible to the public eye. Few eyebrows, for example, were raised when the wife of the late Labour frontbencher Peter Shore also happened to be Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the DHSS; and no one today appears to take exception to the fact that the wife of Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, is herself a very senior official in the Cabinet Office. In both cases the saving grace would seem to be that each career found fulfilment in a non-speaking part. (The sole male consort of a prime minister recently followed suit.) It is hard to resist the conclusion that the factor that sets alarm bells ringing is the mere notion of the chatelaine of No 10 possessing and expressing beliefs and convictions of her own.</p>
      <p>But why should she not have the right to do so? It is not as if she occupies in contrast to the First Lady of the United States -even a symbolic constitutional role. Under our system that position is more than adequately filled by Her Majesty the Queen.</p>
      <p>The time has surely come for even the most chauvinistic minds in the media to try to put aside their hang-ups. The notion of "the loyal little woman" representing the one acceptable model for the spouse operating at the top of politics is not only out of date but offensive as well. Cherie Booth will have completed the work of the suffragettes only when she finally succeeds in vanquishing it.</p>
      <p>BOSSYBOOTS AND BUSYBODIES</p>
      <p>When back in 1979 I was appointed Editor of The Listener, the first thing I had stuck in front of me was a contract, one of the clauses of which expressly laid down that I was nowhere to discuss BBC affairs or broadcasting policy in print. My protest to the general manager of BBC Publications that I thought that this was what I was being hired to do failed entirely to make any impact.</p>
      <p>Like a serviceman or a civil servant with the Official Secrets Act, it was patiently explained to me that the promise to keep silent on all sensitive issues was binding on all BBC employees -and the most I was allowed to do was to allude in an accompanying memo to what were termed "the special difficulties" in my own case.</p>
      <p>I was reminded of that ludicrous episode by the new "guidelines" now apparently to be imposed on any BBC staff member or even freelance presenter who happens to write regularly in the press. Where their material is in any way "sensitive" it will, it appears, in future have to be referred upwards to higher authority in advance.</p>
      <p>We may have moved a millimetre or two since the days when you were summarily dismissed from the BBC if you dared to be selected as a parliamentary candidate. But it is still dismaying to discover that the same "bossyboots" spirit still lurks in Broadcasting House. At least, I suppose, it is something that once again the same officious busybodies have managed to lock the door long after the horse has bolted.</p>
      <p>HOW NOT TO APPOINT AN ARCHBISHOP</p>
      <p>What a hash No 10 has made of the appointment of the next Archbishop of Canterbury. To be hit amidships by a leak on the selection made by the Crown Appointments Commission -as happened as a result of Ruth Gledhill's exclusive splash in The Times last month -may be considered a misfortune: to allow four weeks to go by without denying or confirming the story looks not so much like carelessness as callousness. When Downing Street did finally stir its stumps last week it was only -in an echo of Lewis Carroll -to seek to vindicate a leak by a leak. In two or three convoluted stories, "informal sources in the Blair camp" were reported to be ready to confirm that Dr Rowan Williams, the present Archbishop of Wales, would, indeed, become the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
      <p>But, if they were ready to do that, why could not the appointment simply be announced? To be fair, there was a certain amount of guff about the need for "the formal appointment process, involving Buckingham Palace as well as No 10, to be rigorously adhered to". But who exactly did Downing Street think it was kidding?</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister had seen the Queen in his regular weekly audience only the previous Tuesday and could easily have cleared the whole business up then and there. (All the formal procedures -election by the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, approval by the Court of Arches and all the rest -come into play only after the appointment, not before it.) Assuming that Dr Rowan Williams has already accepted the post, what can be holding things up? I trust it is not a last desperate attempt on No 10's part to find a way of "spinning" what is already a non-news story.</p>

      <title>There's a collective yearning among designers for a return to the elegance of Fifties models</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>A sleek military tailored coat such as Balenciaga's (above) will update any wardrobe</p>
      <p>Russian dolls, Edie Sedgwick groupies, the original Cristobel Balenciaga's goths, little drummer boys, Hitchcock heroines -it's wild inside a designer's brain this winter, and probably best left well alone on the whole. Which isn't to say that there aren't certain items that might have been considered superfluous to her existence as recently as a decade ago but are now mandatory in a woman's armoury. An up-to-date wardrobe among them. To be hopelessly frumpy is about as acceptable these days as being wilfully technophobic and proud of it. Why not get nostalgic about cholera and pea-soupers while you're at it?</p>
      <p>So while it's wise not to get overexcited by Russian dolls, etc, it's an excellent plan to extrapolate a few fresh ideas. If the core wardrobe is in good shape, then you shouldn't need more than five items, maximum, to ensure a seamless flow from winter 2004 to winter 2005. Trust me on this.</p>
      <p>While I wasn't what you might call gifted at maths, I find that fashion has turned me into a natural when it comes to certain equations. I have, if I say so myself, developed some nifty numerical systems for keeping the flow of clothes in a wardrobe from stagnating in a unworn puddle at the bottom of a pile of discarded shoetrees -and it certainly doesn't entail chucking the whole lot out every season.</p>
      <p>1. The winter coat Update with a coat. You'll wear it every day. Full-skirted, swishy skater skirts with cord detailing, frogging, huge collars and other Tsarist touches might be this winter's big thing, but there is no monopoly on coat style this winter. Nicolas Ghesqui re's coats at Balenciaga are straight and skinny, with a distinctly androgynous, military air. Trenches are also in the picture, so are buttonless, floral, paisley or appliqued coats, peacoats (it's that Edie Sedgwick thing), capes and coats with ribbon ties under the bust. What won't cut it any more are those yummy-mummy swingy sheepskins.</p>
      <p>Embellishment and large flourishes (a dramatic upturned collar) are instant updaters. You could just try adding a jewelled belt. Otherwise head to Reiss for belted purple or black coats with massive collars; Gap for its cropped capes (more of a jacket than a coat); Burberry, Prada or Moschino (for the swishiest coats in town). NB, if last year's coat is still a looker (or better still, one from a couple of years ago that you can call vintage), skip to 2.</p>
      <p>2. Boots You probably have a zillion by now, but stilettos and pointed toes look dated. Flats, chunky heels or wedges are all a better option, as are a round or chiselled toe. Probably in black.</p>
      <p>3. Something tailored There's a collective yearning among designers for a return to the elegance of Fifties models. This is sexier, more sinuous than last year's granny chic, which was a commercial disaster. Fifties elegance probably won't happen, except as a party turn or a glimmer in some crazed TV exec's eye as part of a ladette-to-coquette project, but the jacket is ubiquitous - either military (Topshop has adorable ones, as has Principles and, at the other end of the price range, Chloe), a velvet blazer (Bella Freud has produced a very sharp one for Miss Selfridge, and Armani Jeans has a great mauve one with gathered pockets) or a classic, single-breasted, wasp-waisted number. Wear them casually, with trousers, with a mismatched skirt, or a dress, otherwise the look becomes stagey.</p>
      <p>4. Black Trousers Assuming you already own impeccable black trousers (it is definitely a black trouser season, be they ultra-flared or drainpipe), a couple of skirts will stand you in good stead -something full (not flouncy or ruffled but more sculptural, perhaps lace, or tulle, or even with a rolled hem) is a definite moderniser, and a straight or pencil skirt is a classic whose time has once more come.</p>
      <p>5. A Victorian shirt The high street is swooning under the weight of them. Anyone who's old enough to remember Lady Di in her pie-crust collars should avoid the high-necked versions, and look for something a little less faux-prim - pretty pin-tucked blouses are an excellent basic. But if you insist on wearing a white one with your new black skirts, don't complain to me when someone tries to give you their order for toasted teacakes.</p>

      <author>Steve James; Body; England should be favourites for the World Cup; It's at home in 2019. They have just beaten the champions Australia 4-1 away from home. Yes, they might still only be ranked third in the world but they are surely the team to beat. And the good thing is that they are not shying away from such a status.; "It's something we want to embrace," Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, said. "We should be one of the favourites. Only time will tell how we handle that. But if we go into all of the series between now and that World Cup [which starts on May 30, 2019] thinking we are favourites then that will be good practice. And we will see how the players react."; They still need to adapt better; When they slipped to eight for five in Adelaide in the blink of an eye, it was another example of the fearlessness in their batting becoming too close to recklessness. It is a fine line; but it is the one on which trophies are won.; Who will Ben Stokes replace? It is a battle between Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales as to who will miss out when Stokes returns. "He is leaving [England] after his court case [on February 13]," Bayliss said. "The day or two after that. Straight out to New Zealand."; Could a bowler be dropped?; Maybe Moeen Ali if Joe Root could bowl more, but it is highly unlikely.; For me, Roy plays. Bairstow and Hales take a while to get in - Roy doesn't. He smashes it from ball one and that sets the tone. He will fail quite often but his record-breaking 180 and brisk 49 in Perth were evidence enough of his value. Bairstow flunked his opportunity. He didn't field particularly well either, while Hales was spooked by Pat Cummins. "It is a good problem and he [Stokes] might not fit back in straightaway," Bayliss said. "I do know that everyone knows he is coming back in the team at some stage and that keeps everyone on their toes."; Eoin Morgan is in danger of becoming a one-day version of Mike Brearley (with all due respect to our columnist); Morgan's captaincy has been outstanding. He is always brimming with ideas and was at his best and most inventive when Liam Plunkett was injured in Sydney. But he has not made a half-century in his past nine one-day international innings.; At least Bayliss is not perturbed.; "Morgs is one of those guys who goes through a bit of a spell like that and then out of the blue he comes in and makes a heap of runs," the head coach said. He is right, and a lot of England's batting was below par, but the five-match series in New Zealand that follows the upcoming T20 triangular series will be hugely important for Morgan.; Tom Curran is the real deal; What a performance that was in Perth. It was his strength of character that was so impressive.; "We knew he had that in him," Bayliss said. "He is a bit of a go-getter. He is very confident in his ability. He wants to go out and show everyone the ability he has got."; Chris Woakes and Mark Wood are a settled opening bowling partnership, and Plunkett has done more than enough to justify his place as the third seamer, but Curran is certainly breathing down his neck.; It might be that we have a year of calling for Curran's inclusion, just as we did with Bairstow with the bat last year. That competition is good.; "It is not just the 11," Bayliss said. "It is 14, 15 or 16 guys that can come into the team and play a part. That's very healthy for the team going forward."; Jos Buttler is a genius; Ian Healy, the former Australia wicketkeeper, reckoned that Buttler's hundred in Sydney was the best by a visiting batsman in one-day international cricket. Some praise, but it was some innings.; Only Buttler could have played some of those shots at the end. We really should cherish him. ODI brilliance does not automatically transfer to Tests, but Buttler is one example where I cannot fathom why he cannot make the switch. Maybe it is too late and, given that he plays so little longer-form cricket, the shorter stuff sates him. It is a shame if so.; Woakes is a wizard; Apparently that's what they call him - or so the press-box joke goes anyway ("That's why they call him the Wizard!" at every significant intervention) - but some of his work in this series truly was magical.; It is a measure of his batting brilliance that he looked as dangerous as Buttler in Sydney.; England dodged a bullet with Root being snubbed at the Indian Premier League auction; In private, England will probably be glad that Root is not going. They wanted him to rest before he announced his intention to put his name in the hat. He played superbly in this series but looked shattered at the end. England need him in all formats when it comes to the crunch times. The ease with which he scored in this series - compared with how Steve Smith struggled - was a lesson to any aspiring batsman.; England have plenty of muscle, power and aggression but Root glues them together with his finesse and manipulation of the ball.; Do not write off Australia; If they select a little more smartly, they could be so much better. Nathan Lyon, the off spinner, has to play - put him alongside the three Test-match quicks and you have a rather tasty attack.; It will also be interesting to see how Chris Lynn (he was injured for this series) and maybe D'Arcy Short (selected for the T20 tri-series) go as more aggressive batsmen. A few of the Australia batsmen in the ODI series seemed to be playing for themselves rather than the team.; Didn't they used to say that about England? A long time ago. Things really have changed.; What's next for England?; Twenty20 series with Australia and New Zealand Wednesday, February 7 v Australia, Hobart, 8.40am GMT Saturday, February 10 v Australia, Melbourne, 8.20am Tuesday, February 13 v New Zealand, Wellington, 6am Sunday, February 18 v New Zealand, Hamilton, 6am Squad Eoin Morgan (capt), Sam Billings, Jos Buttler (wkt), Tom Curran, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Dawid Malan, Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, Ben Stokes, James Vince, David Willey, Mark Wood</author>

      <p>Has cross-dressing in the movies gone as far as it can go? Sean Macaulay fears so</p>
      <p>CROSS-DRESSING comedy is a genre that will never get left on the shelf. The top two comedies of all time, according to the American Film Institute, are both gender-benders -Some Like it Hot and Tootsie. But the genre is definitely in need of some new lipstick and a new frock.</p>
      <p>White Chicks (reviewed on page 12), in which FBI officers go under cover as "celebutants", is the third film this year to mine transvestism for laughs, after the women-in-drag Connie and Carla, which reworks the Victor/ Victoria formula of woman-as-man-as-woman, and My Wife Maurice, a French farce in which a bearded man impersonates another man's wife to fend off his angry mistress. The latter has the best premise, but wheels out the cross-dressing far too soon, instead of making it a last resort, as in La Cage aux Folles.</p>
      <p>That scraping sound you hear is both a) the ungainly wobble of high heels and b) the bottom of the barrel being reached. What is going on? Cross-dressing is supposed to be one of history's guaranteed laugh-getters: As You Like It; Charley's Aunt; Bringing Up Baby.</p>
      <p>The quality of these new films is admittedly not high, but is the problem that, in the era of Eddie Izzard and Dennis Rodman, gender taboos are now too minimal to convulse audiences with shocked laughter? How can a Wayan brother in drag look more ridiculous than Rodman, a 7ft male basketball star, with a nose-ring, in a wedding dress? The answer in the case of White Chicks is Caucasian make-up (hopelessly unconvincing, but anyway).</p>
      <p>Revealingly, the film finds more of a frisson playing off racial stereotypes than sexual ones.</p>
      <p>Plotting the evolution of the genre shows the peril of liberal progress for comedy. What was once a daring, titillating charade is now a perfunctory spa rinse delivering a light sheen of chauvinistic enlightenment.</p>
      <p>In White Chicks, the men duly return from their cross-dressing adventure with renewed appreciation for women, even though their insights are fairly antediluvian. High heels are hard. Some men won't take no for an answer. Women wearing perfume want to be touched. And -sob -even rich, thin, beautiful white girls have self-esteem issues about their weight.</p>
      <p>Perfunctory didacticism became enshrined in the genre thanks to Tootsie, where the "armature" of the film, as the director, Sydney Pollack, called it, was how dressing as a woman helped Dustin Hoffman to become a better man.</p>
      <p>The difference is that Tootsie made this improvement a massive, central character growth for its hero. Hoffman begins the film as a driven selfish male pig who chats up women indiscriminately, regardless of his girlfriend. He meets even worse examples of his fellow sex once he dons his disguise -most amusingly, a vain old co-star -whereupon he gradually realises that he has to change.</p>
      <p>Tootsie, though, avoids being an earnest lecture on chauvinism with a smattering of clever ironies about the sexes. It's not a one-way critique by any means. While in drag, Hoffman listens to Jessica Lange pine for a honest, direct man who will simply come up and pay her compliments and ask her to go to bed. When Hoffman, back in his male clothes at a party, does just that, she throws a glass of wine in his face.</p>
      <p>In Some Like It Hot, the pinnacle of the genre, Tony Curtis has a moral growth similar to Hoffman's. Before meeting Marilyn Monroe, he was a musician who usually left his women "with nothing but a kick in the teeth". By the end he's doing the decent thing.</p>
      <p>But this is a pre-feminist film, so Curtis doesn't become a more decent man by virtue of being a woman. His change is still the standard moment of redeeming honesty in any good comedy of disguise and deception. And the film's final arbiter of benign acceptance is not a woman but a man -Joe E. Brown's smiling millionaire -who is unfazed even by his true love, Josephine, turning out to be Jack Lemmon.</p>
      <p>Some Like It Hot is a pioneering classic because most early cross-dressing films were simply ruses to assail the male hero's dignity, such as I Was a Male War Bride, made in 1948, where Cary Grant has to dress up as a female officer in order to get home and consecrate his new marriage.</p>
      <p>Apart from the obvious visual gags of a man trying to be ladylike, the better drag films did show the man developing more female characteristics. Grant, for example, gets offended when he is whistled at by men, then gets more offended when he is not. It is almost a given that drag comedy will feature the hitherto carefree male suddenly panicked by having nothing to wear. Just as a man will almost always unwittingly pursue a woman who is really a man.</p>
      <p>By the time of Mrs Doubtfire, though, in the political correct 1990s, the sexual element was all but removed -although the moral growth was still there. Robin Williams learns to be a better father by being a responsible woman.</p>
      <p>It took gimmicky drama like The Crying Game and cross-dressing in the other direction, such as Boys Don't Cry, to put the sting back in the genre. But women-as-men are nowhere near as popular, certainly not for comedy. A woman who dresses as a man tends to gain power rather than lose dignity.</p>
      <p>The next step could well be a man who dresses like a woman and enjoys it so much he wants to make it permanent.</p>

      <title>Filipe Luís finds satisfaction at conclusion of arduous Journey</title>
      <subtitle>In the final part of our series on the new stars of the Premier League, Rory Smith profiles a rags to riches fairytale</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It is so hard to believe that the natural assumption is that it must be, at the very least, an exaggeration, if not entirely apocryphal. It sounds like the start of a particularly saccharine, straight-to-video movie. Still, the tale of how Filipe Luís started a journey that ends at Stamford Bridge, as Chelsea's new £20 million left back, bears repeating.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2000, Figueirense, the Brazilian side, travelled to the town of Jaragua do Sul, deep inside the state of Santa Catarina, for their pre-season training camp. Abel Ribeiro, the club's coach, wanted to stage an 11-a-side game at the end of a session, but so slender were his resources that he found himself a man short.</p>
      <p>He asked one of the club's former stars, Ricardo, to recommend a local player he might draft in to make up the numbers. He suggested a whippet-thin 15-year-old who had come to prominence playing for the town's futsal side, but had since found himself out of favour after an influx of players from out of state. He might be far more familiar with the indoor game than the outdoor, but his promise was obvious.</p>
      <p>When Figueirense returned to their base in the surf resort of Florianopolis, they did so with Filipe Luís in tow. Despite the vast culture shock, on the pitch and in his new life, it would not be long before he was challenging another emerging talent, Andre Santos, for a place in the first team.</p>
      <p>If that sounds like football at its romantic best, there is another aspect to Filipe Luís's rise that showcases the sport at its murky, unappealing worst. It centres on a three-year legal wrangle over his ownership that, at one point, threatened to result in one of Spain's most famous sides being thrown out of La Liga, thanks to the protestations of a club that the Brazilian never even represented.</p>
      <p>By 2004, Filipe Luís's star was in the ascendant. He spent a season on loan from Figueirense at Ajax, before being transferred to Rentistas, a club in Uruguay's second division, in 2005. If that seems curious, it is explained in that Rentistas were being used as a "screen" club by Juan Figer, one of South America's most powerful agents. The deal was what South Americans refer to as a pase fantasma: a ghost move.</p>
      <p>Figer had bought Filipe Luís's economic rights while he was still in Florianopolis. He was effectively parking him - or more accurately, his playing licence - at Rentistas. The full back never played for the Montevideo side, spending a season on loan with Real Madrid's development team, then two years at Deportivo La Coruña.</p>
      <p>Such arrangements are common in South America, but Filipe Luís's experience of being owned by a third party suggests that, from a player's point of view, the Barclays Premier League's refusal to countenance them is praiseworthy. "I felt like a piece of merchandise for four years," he said. "I was loaned out to anyone and everyone." It is no surprise that he was desperate to join Deportivo permanently when they tried to sign him in 2008. After all, he said, "now I can have a five-year contract, security, and I do not have to be afraid of getting injured."</p>
      <p>The Spanish side agreed a fee of (EURO)2.2 million (now about £1.6 million), the vast majority of which was due not to Rentistas, but to Figer. When the first tranche of money - about (EURO)750,000 - did not arrive, the Uruguayan side involved their lawyers.</p>
      <p>The case dragged on for three years before the clubs reached an agreement. In that time, Rentistas had referred the matter to Fifa, with the club's president, Alvaro Astray, threatening to seize the Spanish side's advertising income and even warning Deportivo that they could be "prevented from playing if they do not pay what they owe".</p>
      <p>As if that turmoil was not enough, in January 2010, Filipe Luís broke a leg in a game against Athletic Bilbao. Deportivo had been challenging for a Champions League place; without their left back, they faded into mid-table. Though he managed to return to full fitness by the end of the season, he would miss out on a place in Brazil's World Cup squad.</p>
      <p>Despite the injury, Atletico Madrid decided he was worth the risk. It was at the Vicente Calderón - and, in particular, under the tutelage of Diego Simeone, the man Filipe Luís credits with being responsible for "transforming" the club - that the world started to see what Ribeiro had seen on the training pitch in Jaragua do Sul.</p>
      <p>The very best full backs dominate games, defining tempo, even from what appears a liminal role. Filipe Luís did just that as Atletico won their first title for almost two decades and went within a minute of winning the Champions League, too. It was enough to attract Chelsea's attention, to make him, at 29, a £20 million player. His is a story of three acts: the first light, the second dark, and now this: the stirring climax.</p>
      <p>Age 29</p>
      <p>Position Left back Cost £20 million Former clubs 2003-04 Figueirense (24 appearances, 1 goal); 2004-05 Ajax (0 appearances, 0 goals); 2005-06 Real Madrid Castilla (37 appearances, 0 goals); 2006-10 Deportivo La Coruña (125 appearances, 8 goals); 2010-14 Atletico Madrid (180 appearances, 5 goals)</p>
      <p>Plays a bit like</p>
      <p>It is hard to imagine a better replacement for Ashley Cole; Luís is just as disciplined, just as tactically astute and just as technically gifted as the former England player</p>

The museum displays the work of these remarkable locals and their brilliant contemporaries.; 1273 844744, closed Mon; 5 Jupiter Artland, Wilkieston, Edinburgh Bound by giant, surreal spirals of grass and water, the drive up to Bonnington House makes it clear that this is no ordinary country estate. Set up by Nicky and Robert Wilson in their (large) back garden, this sculpture park is full of big names (Anish Kapoor, Antony Gormley, Cornelia Parker) and smaller animals (donkeys, sheep and the odd alpaca).; 01506 889900, closed Mon-Wed; 6 Horniman Museum, London SE23 Its crowning glory may be a majestic (if overstuffed) walrus, but it's the museum's collection of 350,000 items from every corner of the globe that make the Horniman an anthropologist's paradise. This summer's Festival of Brasil includes a model favela in the gardens as well as art and performances.; 20 8699 1872, open daily; 7 Robert Smail's Printing Works, Innerleithen, Scottish Borders Founded in 1866, Smail's was a family printing firm that resisted the advance of technology right up until its final owner gave it to the National Trust for Scotland 130 years later.

Look out for the sinister "witch in a bottle".; 1865 270927, open daily; 9 Old Operating Theatre and Herb Garret, London SE1 Hidden inside a church on the original site of St Thomas' Hospital, the herb garret was used to store and dry opium poppies until it was converted into an operating theatre in 1822 - well before the development of proper anaesthesia. You can almost hear the screams of patients strapped to the wooden table for a rudimentary amputation (or worse).; 020 7188 2679, open daily; 10Manchester Jewish Museum Once a place of worship for the city's population of Sephardic Jews, this Moorish-revival former synagogue is the only Jewish museum in the UK outside London.

The delightfully haphazard museum's "hand of glory" - the pickled hand of a hanged man - is surely less of a surprise here than it would be anywhere else. Model ships and cases of carved Whitby jet are on offer for the squeamish.; 1947 602908, open daily; 13Charleston House, Firle, East Sussex It isn't hard to see why Virginia Woolf and the rest of the Bloomsbury set chose this, the house of their artist friends Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, as their countryside retreat. Its interiors match Italianate frescoes with vivid post-impressionism; there's a beautiful walled garden and paintings by Renoir and Delacroix.; 1323 811265, closed Mon-Tue; 14Mary Rose Museum, Portsmouth The flagship of Henry VIII's naval fleet, the Mary Rose was sunk by the French in 1545 and for more than 400 years lay at the bottom of the Solent.

The glass-roofed courtyard restaurant is fabulous.; 20 7563 9500, open daily; 16Hunterian Museum, London WC2 Where else could you find Churchill's dentures, the skeleton of the 18th-century "Irish Giant" Charles Byrne and thousands of antique surgical instruments all together?

Tours of the house, led by Tony Penrose, Miller and Penrose's son, are by appointment.; 1825 872856, open Sun, tours only; 19Leighton House, London W14 The Victorian painter Frederic, Lord Leighton had a taste for the exotic, made clear by his purpose-built home and studio. The Arab Hall is an orientalist kaleidoscope of a room, constructed to show off his huge collection of Middle Eastern tiles, and Flaming June, Leighton's best-known work, which returns to the museum from its improbable home in Puerto Rico for five months this November.; 20 7602 3316, closed Tue; 20Geffrye Museum, London E2 Each a snapshot of domestic bliss in a different historical era, the museum's 11 living rooms chart the evolution of British taste and society from 1600 to the present day. It was overcrowding and pollution that led these 18th-century almshouses to be transformed into a museum in 1914, but today the site's period gardens make it a verdant oasis of calm.; 20 7739 9893, closed Mon except bank holidays 21Watts Gallery, Guildford "I paint ideas, not things," wrote the celebrated Victorian painter George Frederic Watts. There are more than a hundred of those ideas on show here at the UK's only purpose-built gallery devoted to the work of one artist. Newly restored this year is the studio that he shared with his wife, the artist Mary Watts, and, completing the "artists' village", Limnerslease - the Arts and Crafts manor where the couple lived.; 01483 810235, closed Mon except bank holidays; 22Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter This museum is as varied as they come.

      <title>Praise to the Pastors who are cutting crime</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>They pray and sing before patrolling the streets and aim to connect with the community. And they are coming to a street near you, says Kate Burt</p>
      <p>IN HER answering-machine message, Marilyn Garber's soft, girly voice makes her sound about 13. In person, not quite 5ft and around a size 6, the 29-year-old doesn't look much older. When she speaks, you have to get really close to hear what she's saying.</p>
      <p>We're in deepest Hackney, East London, minutes from the area's notorious "murder mile", at pub chucking-out time on a Saturday night. Unlikely as it might seem, Garber is about to take to the streets of the country's fifth most deprived borough with a team of devout Christians in baseball caps to fight local crime.</p>
      <p>What's more surprising is that, according to police statistics, success is on their side. If you live in an urban area and haven't already come across the "Street Pastors", chances are that you soon will.</p>
      <p>The Street Pastors, a voluntary independent inter-denominational Christian organisation, was launched in April 2003 by the Rev Les Isaac. His aim was to patrol the streets and connect with the community, particularly with young people who feel excluded -kids in hoodies, kids with kids, kids from broken homes, with guns and knives, with ASBOs, kids who sell drugs -and change things by reaching the root of recurrent social problems. More than two years later, the initiative has spread to Birmingham, Manchester and Leicester -with units on the way in Leeds, Wrexham, Bromley, Sutton, Merton, Portsmouth and Northampton.</p>
      <p>So far, there are 300 Street Pastors nationwide, with team sizes ranging from around 12-strong, in Brent, up to 23 in Lambeth. In the inner cities of London, Birmingham and Manchester, they will often tackle typically urban problems such as gangs, guns, drugs and knives. Over in Leicester, where these are less of an issue, clubs and pubs have welcomed the Pastors, incorporating their details into projections and leaflets so that young people know that the Pastors are out there when they leave.</p>
      <p>"So often we see young single women out alone late at night," says Eustace Constance, Street Pastors' head office co-ordinator. "A common request is 'Would you just walk me home?' " In Southend, the focus is more on weekend drinkers and boy racers hanging around along the seafront. "Wherever you have crowds and alcohol," Constance continues, "you have the potential for violence. The Southend Pastors are very proactive."</p>
      <p>What seems to be common to each of the operations is the focus on young people.</p>
      <p>Mike Royal is a church minister and the co-ordinator for Birmingham's initiative, which serves the Handsworth, Lozells and Aston areas: "There is a lot of youth that is not engaging, listening or connecting," he says. He recounts the story of a 14-year-old pregnant girl who had been on a police missing persons list for several weeks. "There are places a Pastor can go that the police can't," he says.</p>
      <p>"Their presence can create tension, people can feel nervous and think they're after them. But we can mix and mingle in these places, we get to know all the faces." The Pastors found the missing teenager in one such establishment, and got her into a safe-house.</p>
      <p>"People might think, 'Oh, they're from the church, happy clappy, they have just come along to Bible-bash," says Isaac, a jovial Pentecostal minister, "but we're not concerned with preaching to people. Our approach is: care, listen, help."</p>
      <p>Even in the corners of some of the UK's scariest estates, Street Pastors have gained the unlikeliest of support. "Drug dealers have come up to me on duty and said, 'Reverend, keep up the good work, you're doing a good job'."</p>
      <p>Comparisons with the Guardian Angels and recent Street Warden initiatives are hard to avoid, but Isaac says that they are different: "We are not vigilantes. We don't have the power to fine people." Instead, the emphasis, he explains, is on the practical: a holistic approach to problems in troubled inner-city areas. This is made possible by what Isaac calls the "urban trinity" -a unique relationship that he has helped to create between the Church, the police and local authorities.</p>
      <p>Not that the relationship came easily to the Street Pastors. Despite letters to police chiefs and council executives before they were launched, there was little interest initially. Until Isaac persevered and asked police to compile statistics focused on the nights when one of his teams was out on the street (shifts typically run from 10pm to 4am, Fridays and Saturdays). The results were dramatic.</p>
      <p>In Southwark, South London, a nine-month police evaluation recorded up to a 95 per cent reduction in calls relating to public disorder whenever the Pastors were deployed.</p>
      <p>"We're very impressed with their work," says Inspector Simon Smith, of Southwark Police. "I think their secret is their ability to communicate to the community.</p>
      <p>They're able to engage and divert people and -because they are independent - there are none of the barriers that people might associate with the police or social services. I admire what they do; I wouldn't go out there with no protection."</p>
      <p>Around 70 per cent of Street Pastors nationwide are women. Why does Isaac think that is? "The truth?" he says with a chuckle. "I think that the guys are scared.</p>
      <p>Whereas women have that maternal instinct to respond and look after people."</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard has now sent out a nationwide memo endorsing the Street Pastors.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Harry Doyle, of Scotland Yard, central co-ordinator of the Pastors across London, , says: "The Pastors can help and give advice to people who may be taking illegal drugs, for example, because they are not police officers. And by careful sharing of certain intelligence we can deploy the Pastors to local hotspots, and have given them access to officers who are on duty 24 hours a day. In certain circumstances they can request support if the situation requires it."</p>
      <p>As a result, the police now lend their expertise to the scheme's training sessions all over the country, using a set of working practices and procedures devised centrally at Scotland Yard. In four-hour Saturday afternoon sessions, someone from the local station will come along to the church hall with a PowerPoint presentation and handouts to teach skills such as crowd control, anger management and police protocol. It's very much an introduction, though; a foundation course rather than a PhD in street life. And new recruits are let loose to patrol after just the first couple of sessions.</p>
      <p>Most conspicuously, there is no training in self-defence. "Yes, people have mentioned that," Isaac says. "Someone even suggested we wore stab vests. But the minute you go down that road, perceptions change."</p>
      <p>It's an attitude that's had the scheme described as "leading lambs to wolves". But Isaac makes no apologies: "We're not blind to the risks, but we feel that our training, policy and common sense protect us."</p>
      <p>So far, he's been right.</p>
      <p>One wonders if things have changed since July 7 for the Pastors. "Like everyone else," says Constance, "we're going to be more vigilant when we go out there. But our purpose hasn't changed at all. When we're out there, we'll talk to people about a variety of topics, from the theological to politics and unemployment.</p>
      <p>Sometimes people just want to vent -and, while we haven't had specific briefs following July 7, we are very aware that there is a real potential for certain people to misdirect their energy."</p>
      <p>In East London, Marilyn Garber's six-strong team is preparing for the long night ahead. It's been a hot and humid day in the city and the streets are simmering with energy -not all of it good. "Hackney seems busy tonight," says someone ominously.</p>
      <p>It seems almost reckless to be preparing for such an outing simply by standing in a circle, holding hands and singing prayers together. The group meets in a local evangelical church; a small, modern, strip-lit room with rows of white plastic garden chairs facing a yellow nylon curtain in front of which there's a little stage and a portable wood-effect lectern. "Hallelujah! Oh yes! Lord we pray for the homeless...for those going through so much pain ..."</p>
      <p>They sing enthusiastically: "We pray for Hackney and the people we will be healing tonight!" Suddenly, the blare of live punk rock drumming crashes into the reverent atmosphere from the warehouse building next door. Twentysomethings clutching bottles of beer giggle as they peer through the window from the adjacent backyard.</p>
      <p>"That's tame for one of their parties," says Garber with a cheerful laugh as prayers are concluded. She turns, smiling warmly, and gives a little wave to the faces staring in.</p>
      <p>Everyone puts on a high-visibility Street Pastors baseball cap and jacket, and we're off.</p>
      <p>"The thing we get the most," says Maryann Wallace, a 29-year-old council traffic manager, as we set out along the busy Lower Clapton Road, "is 'How much do you get paid?' People think we're mad when we tell them that we don't."</p>
      <p>Garber stops to talk to a middle-aged Asian man waiting for the bus with two women in hijabs. "Good evening, sir!" As is the case with most people they will greet tonight, he looks over his shoulder, puzzled as to who she's speaking to. "Hello!"</p>
      <p>she persists. "No, we're not the police, we are from the church, we're just patrolling the streets to make sure everyone's OK ..." goes the well-practised introduction. They chat about which bus they're getting, the weather, where they've been. And then we wave them goodbye and move on.</p>
      <p>A few metres up the road, a guy is sitting outside a late-night convenience store on a crate, sipping a can of beer. Behind him a jumpy young woman starts laughing as the team approaches to strike up a conversation. She speaks in disjointed bursts and is unable to stand still. One second she's laughing hysterically, wanting to be photographed, then angry, making her hand into a gun shape and telling the Times photographer she'll shoot him if he takes her picture.</p>
      <p>Wallace has been a Street Pastor for only two months and has yet to complete her training. She takes her colleague, the more experienced Demetrius Immanuel, 40, to one side and says quietly: "I can't smell alcohol on her breath. Would you say she's on drugs?" Immanuel, who's studying to be a primary school teacher, says she has issues.</p>
      <p>"Stop chatting about me!" the young woman demands aggressively, striding towards us. Wallace doesn't flinch: "Sorry darling," she says soothingly, "Sorry." The warm -never patronising -tone is surprisingly calming; you start to see why people say that they feel safe when there's a group of Street Pastors around.</p>
      <p>As we walk off, Wallace writes down: "Sarah, can be aggressive, possibly homeless, possible issues." Equivalent information from each of the team will be shared in a debrief and collated to build up local profiles (teams work on a rota, each doing one night a month). If someone needs something tangible, say a local drug rehab service or housing help, Pastors will ask for contact details and the office will follow up the conversation on Monday. When an appropriate course of action is agreed, a Street Pastor will be on hand to help the person follow it through, making calls and taking them to appointments.</p>
      <p>Though it's not always about direct help, often it's just a matter of connecting with people. "We met one young lady and all she wanted from us was a hug," recalls Pastor Anwar Bourazza, 33, who's a retail manager in his other life. "It was raining really heavily but she was just standing there in the middle of the street. We asked if she was OK and she just burst into tears."</p>
      <p>One of the women in his team that night obliged with the hug, and discovered she was having domestic issues. "She just felt very unloved," Bourazza says. "You see how people are hurting. A lot of people we meet say that they don't feel any love in their lives and so we're out there to try and change that."</p>
      <p>"I think they can influence people a lot. People who don't have self confidence," says 19-year-old Jay, who's a Muslim. It's 1am and he's hanging outside another late-night shop further up the road. "I usually wouldn't want to chat to people if I didn't know them, but the way they came up to me was, 'Hello, how you doing?' I thought it was nice."</p>
      <p>Jay says he's been kicked out of two separate colleges for smoking cannabis. He would love to be a graphic designer or join the police force but, right now, he's working full-time at Burger King. The Pastors have been encouraging him to resume his education. "I'm happy to know they're on the street. They're like a little boost."</p>
      <p>So what will they do next time they see him? "Hopefully we'll get him round," Wallace says. "We'll just be like, 'All right Jay, how's the college thing going, signed up yet?' " It's around 1.45am and Wallace and Immanuel debate whether to move up the road when a boy on a bike wearing a cap and long, baggy shorts who's gone past a couple of times stops in front of them. "Are you the police?" he asks. Forty minutes later he's still there. Despite his baby face, he's 21 and has two toddlers and a "babymother" to support. It turns out he supports them by selling drugs.</p>
      <p>He's seen his mum go through hard times, he doesn't know where his dad is but he wants more for his children, he wants to be a good father, has dreams of running his own company, but he's stuck in a difficult cycle. His mobile rings constantly: "I can't sort you out now. Stop, you're making me feel shame. I'm trying to talk to some nice respectful people now." He hangs up, shakes his head and laughs: "See? I've got to stop all this s***."</p>
      <p>He says he stopped selling for two weeks to go to write a business plan and that he's stopped hanging around with boys, preferring girls because they're a better influence. But that it's still hard. He needs the money. And then there's the temptation …</p>
      <p>"We still feel temptation!" Wallace tells him, laughing. "There's no magic solution," Wallace says. "It won't change overnight."</p>
      <p>But with some positive guidance, a "boost", perhaps things at least have a better chance of changing at all.</p>

      <title>ALL HAIL THE VACCINE KING</title>
      <subtitle>Adar Poonawalla has all the trappings of a jet-set lifestyle - including an office in a refurbished plane. But he's also the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, with an audacious plan to supply the covid jab to half the planet by this time next year. What's more, he's doing it at $3 a dose, which barely covers costs. interview by Martin Fletcher</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>By the start of 2020, Adar Poonawalla's company, Serum Institute of India, was comfortably the biggest vaccine manufacturer by volume in the world. It was making 1.5 billion doses of vaccines annually against diseases such as polio, tetanus, diphtheria and hepatitis B at its state-of-the-art 100-acre campus in Pune, a city</p>
      <p>90 miles west of Mumbai. Roughly two thirds of all the children on the planet were vaccinated with one or more of its products. At 39, Poonawalla was truly the "vaccine prince" (his father was known as the king) not just of India, but of the world, with a jet-setting lifestyle and exceedingly glamorous wife to boot. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
      <p>"My immediate reaction was that one way or another we'd have to play a significant</p>
      <p>and very crucial role, leveraging our capacities to make vaccines available to the world," Poonawalla tells me over Zoom. He is sitting in a plush white leather chair inside a disused Airbus A320, which he has lavishly refurbished into a swanky office with a lounge, boardroom and bedroom. It was here that he just hosted Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, and made a virtual address to the United Nations general assembly.</p>
      <p>He did not wait for vaccines to be developed. Instead, he immediately embarked on a dramatic expansion of his manufacturing facilities so they would be ready to go the moment a vaccine was approved. "The alternative was to do nothing and just wait for about six months to see which vaccines worked and then invest in capacity," he says. "Countless lives would have been lost."</p>
      <p>Poonawalla invested £270 million of his company's money, and another £300 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to increase Serum's manufacturing capacity from 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion doses a year. He imported giant 4,000-litre, 15ft-tall bioreactors costing £1.5 million each from Europe, and machines capable of filling 500 glass vials a minute. He added 700 new recruits to his 6,000-strong workforce. And in the midst of the global lockdown last April, long before he knew whether or when a vaccine would be forthcoming, he agreed to produce one billion doses of whatever the Oxford University- AstraZeneca research team eventually came up with.</p>
      <p>"It was a huge gamble - huge, huge, huge? People said I was crazy or stupid doing such a big bet at that time," Poonawalla tells me. Even after vaccines enter trials, the chances of them being licensed are little more than 30 per cent, he says. To hedge his bets, he struck similar agreements with three other companies pursuing Covid-19 vaccines: Novavax, SpyBiotech and Codagenix.</p>
      <p>He had sleepless nights as the Oxford team pursued its elusive goal. "I don't know how much hair I've lost - probably more than in the past four years," he says with a laugh. He nonetheless took another big risk in September, when the Oxford vaccine was still at an early stage. He began actually to manufacture it in the hope that it would be licensed, and has already stockpiled at least 50 million doses.</p>
      <p>Happily, his gamble looks likely to come off. Despite some setbacks, he is confident the</p>
      <p>Oxford vaccine will be approved, and as soon as it is he will start churning out 100 million priceless doses a month in an effort - to coin a phrase - to "send the virus packing". He also hopes to start producing the Novavax vaccine in March, and the other two by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>Poonawalla says that he is not concerned that the Pfizer vaccine was approved first.</p>
      <p>"They may have a good vaccine, no doubt about it," he said. "And it may be 90 per cent effective. But 90 per cent of the world will not be able to use it because of the price and the fact it has to be stored at minus 70C."</p>
      <p>By contrast, the Oxford vaccine is easy to store and distribute - and cheap. Under the terms of his agreement with AstraZeneca, Poonawalla will be producing it for 67 developing countries in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), including India and most of Africa. Indeed, his overarching ambition is astounding. It is to supply Covid-19 vaccines to fully half the world's 7.5 billion people in very short order. "If you talk to me this time next year we will probably have achieved, or be on our way to achieving, that target," he says.</p>
      <p>Poonawalla insists his primary motivation is not to make money, but to save lives. That is not just public relations spin. For the duration of the pandemic, the Serum Institute will mostly be selling the AstraZeneca vaccine at $3 a dose, which will barely cover its costs. To meet the demand, moreover, it has suspended production of other types of vaccine destined for Europe and America that it would have sold for $20 or $30 a dose (£15-£23).</p>
      <p>"You can see the sacrifice," says the man who hopes to deliver humanity from the scourge of this pandemic.</p>
      <p>The rise of the Serum Institute of India is a remarkable story of vision and enterprise, and of tables turned.</p>
      <p>Back in the 19th century, or so the story goes, a distant ancestor of Poonawalla's worked as a "billiard marker" in a British officers' club in Poona, as Pune was known in colonial times. He would retrieve the balls, keep the score and fill glasses. He used the connections he made with colonial administrators to win building contracts, and eventually became such a big landowner that people started calling him "Poonawalla" - the fellow from Poona.</p>
      <p>Adar Poonawalla has no idea whether that tale is true or not. His forebears were certainly property owners, but his grandfather</p>
      <p>was one of 14 siblings, so his father, Cyrus, inherited only 40 acres, which were used to breed and race horses.</p>
      <p>His father saw little future for the stud farm in particular, and horse racing in general, in quasi-socialist, post-independence India. To generate extra income, he began selling horses to a government institute in Mumbai so their blood serums could be used to make a tetanus anti-toxin and an anti-venom for snake bites. He then decided to "up the value chain", Poonawalla says. "He said, 'Why should we sell them the horses? Why don't we do this ourselves?' " In 1966, his father set up Serum Institute at a time when most vaccines were imported</p>
      <p>from abroad and far too expensive for hundreds of millions of ordinary Indians. It was also a time when lots of new vaccines were coming on stream, and the business took off. Cyrus Poonawalla, 79, is now the sixth richest man in India with a fortune of roughly $12 billion, just behind the Hinduja brothers but eclipsing the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal.</p>
      <p>By the Nineties, he was wealthy enough to send his only son to St Edmund's School in Canterbury, where young Poonawalla captained the tennis team for two years but earned only middling A levels. From there the boy followed friends to Westminster University, graduating with a second-class business degree. "I was never that good at academics," he admits, but very soon he was demonstrating a considerable flair for business.</p>
      <p>In 2001, he returned to India to join Serum Institute's sales team, travelling around the country to learn the business from the bottom up. He then started developing an international market, cutting the price of vaccines by producing them in huge quantities and focusing on developing countries that the big western pharmaceutical companies ignored. Soon, he says, "we were not able to service the demand".</p>
      <p>In 2011, he became Serum Institute's chief executive and set about doubling its production capacity, not least because he heard Bill Gates give a TED Talk in 2015 in which Microsoft's cofounder warned that a pandemic posed a much greater threat to humanity than nuclear war because the world was so unprepared for one.</p>
      <p>Expansion on that scale was a huge risk that Poonawalla could only take because the company was privately owned and he had no shareholders or investors to constrain him</p>
      <p>- just his father, who on occasion took some convincing. But by the time a global pandemic did finally strike this year, Serum Institute was five times bigger than when Poonawalla joined in 2001, selling vaccines to 170 countries and generating annual revenues in excess of $800 million. It was also a partner of the World Health Organisation, and saving millions of lives. "The contribution it has made to global health has been phenomenal," said Gates.</p>
      <p>Poonawalla now enjoys all the trappings of great wealth, and is quite unashamed of the fact. "We like to enjoy our life, because we're not afraid of retribution or anyone who could question us, in the sense that we've made our wealth legally and properly and ethically," he says. "A lot of people in India have always been fearful of enjoying their wealth, because perhaps some of them have not really done it the right way."</p>
      <p>He has his own 200-acre stud farm with a stylish ranch house near Serum Institute's Pune campus, and breeds many of India's top racehorses. He is trying to finalise</p>
      <p>the purchase of Lincoln House, the former Maharajah of Wankaner's sprawling seafront palace in Mumbai, which later became the US consulate, reportedly for a record price for an Indian residential property of $113 million. He goes to the World Economic Forum in Davos, sails on the French Riviera, attends grands prix and calls the Prince of Wales "a close and very dear friend".</p>
      <p>He has private jets and a helicopter to ferry him between Pune and Mumbai. He owns paintings by Picasso, Dalí, Rembrandt and Rubens. He has a collection of 35 classic cars that includes vintage Silver Cloud and Phantom Rolls-Royces which, in pre-pandemic days, he would sometimes drive around Pune. "I enjoy them more than modern Ferraris and Lamborghinis, which I have a few of, but I hardly enjoy them now because they are so common. It doesn't excite me that much."</p>
      <p>He met his wife, Natasha, in Goa in 2001 at a New Year's Eve party hosted by Vijay Mallya, another Indian business tycoon. They have two sons. She is a highly photogenic favourite of India's glossy magazines. She has been a Vogue cover girl and mixes with Bollywood stars and other glitterati. She counts Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas among her best friends and goes to - and sometimes hosts - the best parties. She models the latest designer clothes and</p>
      <p>has been labelled "India's first lady of fabulousness" by Elle magazine.</p>
      <p>But she is no trophy wife. Soon after Poonawalla gained his modest degree from Westminster University, she earned a master's from the London School of Economics. "She's more qualified to run Serum Institute than I am," Poonawalla says with a laugh.</p>
      <p>She actually runs the Villoo Poonawalla Foundation, Serum's charitable arm, which is named after Poonawalla's late mother. Its immodest ambition is to turn Pune, with a population of six million, into a model Indian city. It finances 7 schools and a hospital, provides clean drinking water at 35 locations, and has hundreds of full-time employees backed by 250 trucks collecting refuse from the streets for conversion into biogas.</p>
      <p>Poonawalla - named India's philanthropist of the year by Indian GQ in 2016 - says he pumps $20-$25 million into the foundation each year. "I feel our impact should be at scale, otherwise there's no point."</p>
      <p>But it is Serum Institute's provision of vaccines to the world's poor that he is most proud of.</p>
      <p>"It's the single biggest motivational factor every day I wake up and I'm feeling lethargic to go to the office," he says. "Everyone here at Serum feels and knows that purpose, and I think what's driven us in the past few years is to know you're making a difference in people's lives and actually saving millions of lives every year."</p>
      <p>Poonawalla expects to be making Covid-19 vaccines for another five or ten years or more, not least because people may need booster jabs and today's largely immune children will grow into more vulnerable adults.</p>
      <p>He is also working with another Oxford University team on a pioneering vaccine for malaria that is in late-stage trials, and with other researchers on vaccines for dengue fever, meningitis and human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer in women.</p>
      <p>Vaccine manufacturing was once a niche industry. Now it is crucial for the future of mankind and, thanks to Covid-19, governments around the world finally understand that.</p>
      <p>Thus Poonawalla plans to increase Serum Institute's manufacturing capacity by a further one billion doses within three years.</p>
      <p>"We have no choice," says the man on whom much of the world depends for its future wellbeing. "If I believe what I'm saying</p>
      <p>about future pandemics and vaccine demand growing, I'd be foolish not to reinvest all my capital."</p>
      <p>He expects global pandemics to become more common as the human population grows, encroaches on animal habitats and travels more, and as climate change creates conditions more conducive to the spreading of disease. "It's a melting pot, a stirring pot, just waiting to churn out more of these kinds of terrible viruses," he says.</p>
      <p>He believes that we were "lucky" with Covid-19. "Can you imagine if ebola were as infectious as coronavirus? We would probably not be having this conversation. One of us would probably not be alive." n</p>
      <p>He began making Oxford's vaccine in September and has stockpiled 50 million doses ahead of its approval He sails on the French Riviera, attends grands prix and calls Prince Charles 'a dear friend'</p>

      <title>I stand in terror on the edge of the ice. What have I got myself into?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Ginny Dougary went to the Antarctic to fulfil a lifelong dream of experiencing the purity and isolation that enticed Scott and Shackleton. Here, in the first of two reports, we follow her diary as she learns the ways of penguins and has a close encounter with whales</p>
      <p>JANUARY 21: The British stiff upper lip is an admirable, indeed possibly a requisite, mechanism for those who wish to cope with the extreme rigours of the resting place and spiritual home of Captain Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton. But in my case, unfortunately, the upper lip stood no chance against the extreme wobbliness of the lower when I was first deposited on the great white continent of the south.</p>
      <p>The noise was tremendous as the Russian cargo plane, an Ilyushin, reverse acceleration at full throttle, landed on the blue-ice runway marked out by a line of snow-weighted black rubbish bags. The plane screamed to a halt, its wide back opened out in two arcs and an extraordinary commotion ensued.</p>
      <p>Large green drums were rolled down ramps to be caught, in what looked like an elaborate game, by teams of men and women, some adorned in brightly coloured comical hats, who harnessed themselves to the containers while seemingly racing one another to deliver their booty to a finishing line on the opposite side of the runway.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere -standing, talking, gazing -were as many as 30 or 40 men, scattered across the turquoise ice. A Korean (could he be the same gentleman who had drunkenly dismantled parts of the stranded DC3 at the edge of the camp the previous year?) kept hurling himself on to the runway and sliding on his belly while whooping loudly. Half a dozen Skidoos -motorbikes on skis -thrummed on and off the ice, pulling sledges piled high with gear.</p>
      <p>More and more people emerged from a point in the distance, walking down a long snow-path which appeared out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>Here is Babs Powell, my favourite dancer from Pan's People when Top of the Pops was a boarding-school highlight of the week. She is arm in arm with Rosie Stancer, who has just walked to the South Pole on her own and looks frighteningly thin, with scabs hanging off her lips and nose. Now comes a man on a throne of a wheelchair strapped on top of a sled: Mike McGrath, who has muscular dystrophy and who has, in walking upright a short distance to the Pole, achieved the equivalent of a double triathlon in an able-bodied man.</p>
      <p>I stand on the edge of the ice, terrified that I'm going to slip over and bash my head. I feel fragile and raw, aware from the frenetic activity of the people around me that I will be expected to be self-sufficient in an environment where I am least equipped to be so. Camping, for goodness' sake, in well-below freezing conditions, with primitive lavatory facilities and no washing, where there could be katabatic winds -that accelerate downhill -which knock me down, and white-outs so dense that I may be uanble to see the tent next door, let alone walk to the dining tent. My confidence has been further undermined by a representative of the company that is allegedly looking after me -a bully and a boor, he turns out to be totally unrepresentative, but at this stage I don't know that.</p>
      <p>The skies are an intense, otherworldly powder-blue, and even the clouds look like no other clouds I've seen before. The nearby monochrome mountains of Patriot Hills, starkly black and white, give way to a blurry, soft-focus range and at the far end of the horseshoe become an electric navy and cream. Beyond, the lone and boundless snow stretches far away. Welcome to Antarctica. What the hell have I got myself into?</p>
      <p>JANUARY 1, 2004: They say that whatever you're doing at midnight on New Year's Eve will dictate the direction of the rest of your year. I spend it working: writing about my fears now that I am actually on my way to Antarctica -a place I've dreamt of visiting for almost a decade.</p>
      <p>Why on earth would you want to go there, some people ask. And, as the observation goes: if you need to ask the question, you will probably never understand the answer.</p>
      <p>I am drawn to the stories of the impossible valour, the largeness of spirit, the gentle manners of the Edwardian polar explorers who "did not forget the please and thank you" even when they were on the point of death.</p>
      <p>The challenge of getting there when it's so damn difficult, either by boat or plane, appeals to me; its associations with danger and death make me suspect that there is nowhere else where you feel so bracingly alive. When I look at photographs of spectacular icebergs -the old, really turquoise ones -I feel a surge of awe and joy. They are like the most beautiful sculptures. How thrilling it would be -will be -to be on the water at their level, weaving in and out of them in a rubber dinghy.</p>
      <p>I'm attracted to extremes and Antarctica, as the well-known litany goes, is the coldest, highest, driest, windiest continent in the world. Its minimalist canvas - huge expanses of white, with occasional lines etched across it -reminds me of certain American abstract canvases that I love. Where other people would say, "What's the point? It's a picture of nothing", I always felt that the conscious absence of things was not the same as no thing. The purpose of the works was that they had been pared back and emptied; transformed into an act of visual meditation.</p>
      <p>Even at quite a young age I would stand mesmerised, finding something suggestive and beguiling where others might merely see a blank. Abstract expressionism tends to polarise people: you either get it or you don't -much, indeed, as do the polar regions.</p>
      <p>Antarctica is a clean slate at another level: a place so empty and pure, the only place in the world that is not owned by anyone, that you feel you might emerge from it cleansed in some odd way, or at least imbued with a fresh way of looking at your old life.</p>
      <p>It is a metaphor, too. For Shackleton: "We all have our own White South." For Thomas Pynchon: "You wait. Everyone has an Antarctic." When my late mother was very ill, too ill for me to risk sailing to Antarctica as I had planned five years ago, it seemed to me synonymous with a merciful oblivion. When I felt trapped and constrained by work and domesticity, it represented the most desirably far flung of escapes.</p>
      <p>And here I am, on the opening day of the year, at midnight on a plane on the first leg of my journey, bound for Buenos Aires.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 2: Emerging from the airport, the warmth feels as welcoming as an embrace.</p>
      <p>I'm staying in the Four Seasons, all luxe, volupte and not a little charme, either. I am stalked, however, by the spectre of Madonna. She stayed in the extremely elegant old palazzo in the grounds of the hotel in a suite opposite mine; the manicurist who comes to my room was also summoned by Madge and found Madame very haughty, judging by her rather good impersonation. And on a whirlwind tour, my favourite building is the presidential palace -delightfully pink where Madonna was granted permission to sing to the people from the central balcony in her role as Evita.</p>
      <p>When in Argentina, eat steak. And I do, with relish. I also have my last proper (full, not midget-length) bath for more than a month.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 3: First travel trauma. My ticket from Buenos Aires' local (as opposed to international) airport to Ushuaia -the end of the world, as it calls itself accurately if rather melodramatically -is not recognised, and I cannot understand why or even begin to make myself understood. A lovely family from Mexico City intervene, interpret and give me some local currency to make phone calls.</p>
      <p>Ushuaia, when I do get there, is a cross between a cowboy frontier town, an out-of-season ski resort and a hippy mecca. It is also a former penal colony. The houses are brightly painted shacks with corrugated roofs, the backdrop is ice-capped, jagged mountains. A boy rides down the main street on a horse.</p>
      <p>Everywhere one looks there is a profusion of poppies and bleached peach lupins.</p>
      <p>I stay at the unfortunately named Albatross hotel (very basic but clean, at least). My copolar correspondent, Jonathan Gornall, finds the combination of the Albatross and my Antarctic Russian cruise ship, the Orlova -or the It's All Over for Dougary, as he likes to call it -absolutely bloody hilarious.</p>
      <p>Solitary dinner in carrillo (grill, pronounced carri-jo) with gaucho theme. I end up joining a pilot and his wife for coffee. He has met Jennifer Murray -wife of Simon Murray, who this year, at 63, became the oldest man to walk to the South Pole -after her helicopter crash in Antarctica. He tells me that she was incredibly lucky to have escaped so lightly -something I am to hear many times in Patriot Hills.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 4: Board "All Over" at 4pm, after interviewing Simon on his satellite phone. He seems far more concerned with how I am going to cope camping in Antarctica than with his own expedition woes. He and Pen Hadow make Patriot Hills sound like Cold Comfort Colditz; Martin Hartley, the photographer, makes it sound like Club Med-sur-snow. Have my own dark suspicions about which version will prove more accurate.</p>
      <p>The ship is not in the first flush of youth; its "forward lounge" has the faded aura and mirrored ceiling of a Seventies bordello. My cabin is quite appealing, largely because I'm not having to share it with anyone.</p>
      <p>I am surprised to find myself in a gang of sorts already -all American. There is a Californian doctor whose regular house guests when he lived in Alaska were Ted Hughes and his son, drawn by the fishing; a lawyer; a foot specialist; an illustrator; and a Manhattan commercials director who reminds me of a (less dizzy) Grace from the TV series Will and Grace.</p>
      <p>Sadly, she and I concur, there don't seem to be any Wills on this boat -on which point we are both happy, a day or two later, to find ourselves proved quite wrong.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 5: O woe! My first experience of sea-sickness crossing the notorious Drake's Passage. It may be a Lake rather than a Shake, ie, relatively calm, but the lurching motion is horrible. Unable to walk in a straight line. Sweat profusely. Attempt to stagger along the corridor -plastic bags adorn the rails at convenient heaving distance -and crawl up the stairs to the main deck, which is like the Mary Celeste.</p>
      <p>Retire for the day, like most of my hundred-odd fellow passengers, emerging at tea-time for an excellent Shackleton lecture in the bordello lounge, where many of us favour the velveteen pouffes at floor level (less queasy-making) over the circular banquettes. Note that no matter how many times I hear the Endurance story, in whatever form, I find it enthralling and moving.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 6: First iceberg spotted just before lunch, looking ghostly in the mist.</p>
      <p>By the time we are sitting in the dining room, the sun has scorched through the fog to reveal dazzling blue water and more and more bergs, some quite monumental.</p>
      <p>We are to have a landing to view a chinstrap penguin rookery at Half-Moon Island, and go through elaborate drill for embarking on Zodiac dinghies. First we have to tog up, which is a real palaver in Antarctic conditions, especially where water is involved: thermal leggings and top, layers of fleeces, thin socks and thick socks, level-four goggles or specs (to protect eyes from massive hole in ozone layer), wellies, waterproof trousers and jacket, inner gloves, waterproof outer gloves, spare gloves and socks in case of soaking which will then freeze, causing frostbite and loss of digits, rucksack with waterproof inner lining to carry camera, sunblock, lip block, etc, hat and neck tube...queue to get into Zodiac; turn key to show one has departed (turn back on return); avoid falling into Antarctic water (on previous trip several people did not); when disembarking into shallow water, legs must be pointed down towards fellow passengers but not thrust into their faces, and so on.</p>
      <p>The first passengers off tread a path through the snow, and those of us who follow find that if we deviate from it we are liable to sink through the soft layers up to our knees. When this happens we have to turn round and fill each hole with snow to prevent penguins falling in and getting trapped.</p>
      <p>Olle, our masterful Swedish expedition leader, has gone to great lengths to explain to his shipful of tourists that we must do everything we can to make a minimal impact on the environment. Here, for instance, the penguins rule: if you see one making towards you, remember that it has right of way.</p>
      <p>The penguins are so humorous with their self-important, busy waddling. I love it when they trip over and then look round to check that no one noticed before resuming their ascent or descent along their penguin highway. High up in the rocks, we watch as the males steal pebbles from the females' flinty nests and deposit them on other nests. Why? Seemingly just because they can. Olle tells us that a group of scientists placed bright-coloured stones on the nests and watched in amazement as the stones were transported all over the rookery.</p>
      <p>Mike, a middle-aged American pilot with a cautious smile and melancholy eyes, lies down on the snow next to "the highway" for a full 30 minutes and is rewarded by having several penguins peck at the back of his head before leaning over and staring him straight in the face.</p>
      <p>At dinner, "Grace" decides that our first real day in Antarctic waters deserves a celebratory toast and buys the gang a bottle of Moet. Afterwards we play Scrabble and my partner -a banker from Las Vegas -disappears to the bar, then goes crazy when I make a move without him, bellowing: "I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU DID THAT! HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? YOU JUST THREW THE POINT AWAY!", resuming the tirade at regular intervals. As justification for this, he explains that he is a member of Mensa "which is both my blessing and my curse" -the curse obviously being having to deal with quotidian morons like myself.</p>
      <p>My Manhattan gal-pals inform me that his peculiar behaviour is par for the course back home; most American men are as angry as hell and don't care who knows it.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 7: Good weather has momentarily deserted us and a landing has to be cut short because of fears that winds may soon prevent us returning to the ship. This did happen last year at this same spot on Turret Point, King George Island, and six passengers had to huddle under a Zodiac for 21 hours before they were rescued.</p>
      <p>I fall for one particular Adelie penguin that looks terribly lost and lonely and keeps swivelling round as though to say: "Oh, oh, where's me mate?" Penguins, you see, are sociable creatures. I watch him, trying to put on a brave face, as he takes off as fast as he can to catch up with the other Adelies in the far distance, waddling too fast, falling over, scooting along on his belly until he finds his pal -and then off the two of them go: waddle, trip, sliding along.</p>
      <p>The wallowing elephant seals lumber out of the water and give us baleful, accusatory looks.</p>
      <p>Go to bed to the sound of Olle's voice on the loudspeaker: "Come on deck to see the beauty of it all, the sun caressing the snowy peaks ..."</p>
      <p>JANUARY 8:...and wake up to the sound of Olle's strangulated cockerel impersonation. "Cerkle derkle dooooooo!" Landing on a black volcanic Deception Island. Very dramatic but doesn't feel Antarctic at all.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 9: Best day so far, and hardly a penguin in sight. But oh, what glorious blue icebergs in Paradise Bay. I see castles, the Sydney Opera House, mating polar bears, the grandest of arches above pools of phosphorescent turquoise light.</p>
      <p>The sun glints on the water, there is a lone white yacht at the edge of the bay, the silence...well, actually it's not silent because of all the camera and video activity. At times the whirring and clicking can seem like a Tourette's affliction. The beauty is not being enjoyed and experienced here and now but for some time hence. Not trusting the mind's eye to recreate the moment in private, the camera's eye will collect evidence of paradise to be witnessed later by friends and family and neighbours.</p>
      <p>But I appreciate the photographs that people are kind enough to send me when I get home much more than the ones I feel impelled to take myself. And anyway, who's to say that setting these experiences down in words doesn't reduce them. I make a note of seeing a group of penguins at the top of an iceberg: one slides gingerly down into the water, then -most tentatively -another and another until suddenly, whoosh! They're all tumbling over one another as they fall in, and it's a glorious and hilarious sight. The grey, fluffy newborns with their touching mini penguin forms, being fed while still in their shells. The unexpected elegance of the penguins' movements once they are in the water. The furry, wrinkled faces of the seals as they gaze back at us with their round, solemn eyes. The words trigger the memories but also dilute them in some way, making them seem less real as they move from private to public domain.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, another landing. This one, Olle has announced in his deadpan mode, should bring out the inner child in us. We are to hike up a glacier, then fling ourselves down it (much like the penguins, but hopefully not into the water). Once again I am struck by the gusto and fitness of the over-sixties brigade. There are people in their eighties ascending the mountain, fleet as gazelles. I have to push myself to keep up. And there are at least four disabled passengers with sticks way ahead of me.</p>
      <p>The climb is vertiginous, the views sensational, and there are far too many of us perched on a narrow rocky ledge. I am really scared -disliking heights and speed, let alone a combination of the two -but grit my teeth and set off on my behind down the run we have made. And I like it so much I do it again, albeit from the halfway mark -this time on my belly like my new penguin friends. Is it worrying that I have started walking like them too, stomach out, extending my arms stiff behind me for balance?</p>
      <p>JANUARY 10: Visit the old British base of Port Lockroy, which has been charmingly restored (primary-coloured tongue and groove, red gingham curtains) by British Antarctic Survey. Find pile of old Woman's Weekly with first short story by Barbara Cartland: "As gay as St Moritz!" reads the promo line. Penguins tend to their newborn chicks and kleptomaniac rituals on the steps of the hut.</p>
      <p>In the evening the BAS chaps come to shower and barbecue on the deck of the Orlova while the Russian staff dance to Dancing Queen. Much later, around midnight, there is a wonderful blaze of pinks and blues on the horizon: the icebergs look as though they have been brushed with mercury.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 11: It has been agreed that Kara, the whale expert, will take me on a private Zodiac cruise on which there will be no quips or clicks or whirrs or shrieks, and no sound of revving engines. Finally, just tranquillity as we float and reflect.</p>
      <p>I'm not even all that interested in the wildlife, but you can't help but respond when you see a crab-eating seal sunbathing on an iceberg. We hear a whoosh in the distance which Kara thinks may be another seal breathing. Then we see the spume rising not far from the surface of the water, and seconds later another arc of spume alongside. So there are two! We make our way towards them and as we get close, Kara exclaims: "Oh my God! They're humpbacks and they're sleeping. I have never, ever seen this before." We are now very close indeed. White-ish stripes glow under the water and the heads are crusted with barnacles. Not having done my whale homework, I'm wondering if what is visible -sort of log-like shapes with a fin -is the extent of their size. "Oh no, humpbacks are immense," Kara says.</p>
      <p>"Maybe 45 to 50ft long." This is both thrilling and terrifying to hear. We seem to be in a dream with no will of our own. We're drifting dangerously close to them now but neither of us wants to turn on the engine and wake them. It feels weirdly as if we're sharing their bed; the gentle sound of their intermittent breathing is soothing. They are less frightening because they seem to be unaware of our presence.</p>
      <p>Before we actually collide, Kara comes to and, as quietly as she can, revs the engine. The whales react immediately but we are able to follow them and keep at a sensible distance.</p>
      <p>All is calm again until one of the pair makes a circular motion and it swiftly dawns on us that he is coming straight towards us. Kara is jumping up and down with excitement. Five years of studying whales and she has never been this close, at this level, to a large whale.</p>
      <p>Humpbacks don't attack unless they are in a mating or a feeding frenzy, she says, and this one doesn't appear to be in any kind of frenzy. Nor is he likely to overturn our little Zodiac because whales have good spatial awareness. They don't bang into icebergs, for instance. But the closer it comes, the more aware I am that if the dinghy capsized and we were trapped underneath it, our lifejackets would automatically inflate and we'd drown.</p>
      <p>But just at this moment, I don't care. Kara starts banging the rim of the Zodiac, and I follow suit. The other whale is staying away but this one now circles us - Oh my God, he is actually alongside us. We could reach out and touch him. With one flip of his magnificent tail, he could …</p>
      <p>The adrenalin is absolutely pumping. He circles us again and then disappears. Now we are really alarmed. What if he were?...Could he be? …</p>
      <p>Kara sees it first, the blue whiteness of the sides of his belly; the white flecked with grey under the tail; the whole great, beautiful being of him gliding right under us.</p>
      <p>We are both euphoric and overwhelmed when we finally return to the shore. I am being asked to keep this extraordinary experience to myself, in case other passengers are put out.</p>
      <p>The staff, however, all know. Brendon, a fellow whale worshipper, lends me his arm to steady me as I step out of the Zodiac and grins beatifically: "Welcome to my church," he says.</p>
      <p>JANUARY 12-14: Not surprisingly, after that the rest of the cruise was unremarkable. At night Kara kept dreaming about the humpbacks and didn't even bother to go on deck when the waters were teeming with them, as though she were afraid of cluttering the purity of our encounter with other images.</p>
      <p>Some hours after dinner on the final Sunday, I go up to the deck by myself and take in the last white, ghostly form of Antarctica. The winds that will make the return crossing of Drake's Passage such a nightmare -Perfect Storm waves bucking our ship around like a child's plaything -are already picking up. The dining room chairs are strapped down, the white tablecloths dripping wet to prevent plates and cutlery falling off -to no avail. The Orlova turns into the Mary Celeste once again, and then we are back in Ushuaia.</p>
      <p>Later that day I fly to Punta Arenas on the tip of Chilean Patagonia, where I am to wait -and wait -for the go-ahead to take off for Patriot Hills and the mainland of Antarctica.</p>

      <title>HANG A HOCKNEY ABOVE THE BED, PUT A POOL IN THE BASEMENT</title>
      <subtitle>Home! Interiors special How one couple transformed a London family house into a vast shrine to modern art - complete with an installation in the downstairs loo</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>On the kitchen wall of Mehves and Dalinc Ariburnu's west London home hangs a gargantuan photograph by Marina Abramovic, entitled The Kitchen I: Levitation of Saint Theresa, which shows the saint in flight above a stack of pots and pans. Like the Officine Gullo island unit that sits beside it - David Beckham popped round when he was considering buying one because it was the largest of its kind in London - or the enormous 4,500sq ft basement built beneath, much about this house is oversized. The structural renovations took two years to complete and included moving the central staircase and excavating the entire garden so that the kitchen now sits at ground floor level.</p>
      <p>The London-based Turkish couple's home has seven bedrooms (and two staff bedrooms), a basement swimming pool, gym, lift and artwork from Antony Gormley, David Hockney, Gerhard Richter and Tracey Emin, among many others.</p>
      <p>It is Mehves Ariburnu who masterminded the transformation of the five-storey house with the help of Shalini Misra, an interior architectural designer and old friend.</p>
      <p>"Shalini has a background in architecture and is a magician with spaces, but what she really understood was that, as well as somewhere to showcase our art collection, it is first and foremost a home for my husband and three teenage children, and extended family who often come to visit," says Ariburnu.</p>
      <p>Tonally mismatched furnishings and textured fabrics - velvet, linen, leather - dominate the series of open-plan living spaces in this Italianate-style house. They are spread over several storeys: a kitchen and dining area opens onto the garden and there are two sitting areas on the first floor.</p>
      <p>A former banker and investor in the Hussein Chalayan fashion house, Ariburnu caught the art bug after she left banking. With the encouragement of an art consultant, she would visit art fairs and go on studio visits. It wasn't long before she decided, with her banker husband, Dalinc, to open an art gallery in her native Istanbul to promote the local art scene.</p>
      <p>Ariburnu's favourite piece is an installation of dinner dishes that look as if they have just been dumped in a pile, in the garden. And there's more as you walk through the front door: visitors are greeted by a Mummy sculpture by Polish artist Pawel Althamer.</p>
      <p>It's a polarising piece of art. The bronze doors embroidered with thick grey wool threads that disguise a lift as well as the coat cupboard are typical of Misra's predilection for decorative flourishes.</p>
      <p>The cubic marble flooring in the hallway and steel figure by Antony Gormley set a monochromatic palette that is also in the sitting room. On the ornate inlaid marble floor sits a swirl-shaped table by Massimiliano Locatelli from Milan's Nilufar Gallery.</p>
      <p>Hanging above are bronze pendants by lighting maestro Michael Anastassiades.</p>
      <p>It is important to Ariburnu how all the pieces interact with each other: "That, I think, is when you can call your art a collection."</p>
      <p>Opposite the dining table hangs Tracey Emin's Beautiful Girl etching, beside a series of 12 double-exposure photographs by Robert Heinecken. A pale grey Daniel Arsham sculpture, Thinking Glass Figures, adds a textural element, as does Michael Raedecker's slate-coloured wall hanging.</p>
      <p>The relocated staircase now sends you clockwise between all floors, a decision influenced by Vastu Shastra principles - a traditional Hindu system of architecture that Misra follows, which is intended to bring harmony to a home.</p>
      <p>Does Ariburnu's husband have much of a say in all this? She laughs and says, "If you look around and think, what is that piece of art doing over there, then that's probably him. He buys at auction, which I don't. Perhaps that is a working in finance thing."</p>
      <p>In the basement hall, a Pedro Reyes mixedmedia series of photographs and paintings, Los Mutantes, is hung vertically, column by column, creating a narrative opposite the pool. Even the gym room has collectible, albeit functional, designs - an original Charlotte Perriand shelving unit from the Fifties lines the back wall.</p>
      <p>Upstairs in the main bedroom and bathroom, the palette - and materials - soften. The flooring combines tan leather tiles laid in a herringbone pattern. Another Vastu Shastra principle that Misra adheres to is that headboards should never face north.</p>
      <p>The house is like a lived-in art gallery.</p>
      <p>Above the bed hangs David Hockney's painting Study for the Emperor's Palace, from his opera set for Igor Stravinsky's The Nightingale. And there's even an artwork - a music installation - in the downstairs loo. n www.shalinimisra.com</p>

      <title>The most grimly familiar tale in US history</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>* The alleged plot to kill Barack Obama fits a dramatic pattern that began at a theatre 140 years ago in Washington</p>
      <p>A few months ago Doris Lessing, the novelist and Nobel laureate, was discussing the life-expectancy of Barack Obama, should he win the race to the White House: "He would probably not last long, a black man in the position of president," she mused. "They would kill him."</p>
      <p>Lessing was roundly criticised for insensitivity, but in the light of the arrests in Colorado yesterday, her remarks now seem grimly prescient.</p>
      <p>When I heard that a group of men had been arrested on suspicion of plotting to kill the Democratic presidential candidate in Denver, my first reaction was not shock, but rather a thudding sense of deja vu - for the narrative of presidential assassination has become deeply embedded in American culture, the most grimly familiar story in American history.</p>
      <p>Mr Obama has been stalked by the possibility of assassination since he declared his candidacy. After all, Colin Powell, the last African-American to contemplate running for president, pulled out because his wife apparently feared his assassination.</p>
      <p>Every few weeks during the campaign, the possible threat to Mr Obama has bubbled to the surface, often inadvertently. Hillary Clinton was savaged in May for remarking: "We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California."</p>
      <p>Mike Huckabee, a former contender for the Republican nomination, apologised after joking, in a speech to the National Rifle Association, that a sudden noise offstage had been Mr Obama diving to avoid a gunshot. The boxer Bernard Hopkins was blunter: "They won't let him become president, but if they do, it will be for a short time, maybe less than a month."</p>
      <p>The colour of Mr Obama's skin, obviously, makes him a target, but beyond the violent racism that still festers in the sump of American society is the extent to which the long and bloody tradition of presidential assassination looms over US politics. There have been at least 17 assassination attempts against presidents, and four of the 43 presidents were murdered in office.</p>
      <p>The alleged would-be assassins arrested this week do not strike me as historians. They are unlikely to be conscious of following in the footsteps of John Wilkes Booth, the killer of Abraham Lincoln, and less likely still to recognise the name of Charles Guiteau, who murdered James Garfield in 1881. But they will most assuredly know of Lee Harvey Oswald, the enduring role model for the disgruntled American assassin.</p>
      <p>The motives of presidential killers vary widely. Some provide a rationale. "I did it for my country," Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian, said after killing Bobby Kennedy over his support for Israel. Others, such as John Hinckley, who attempted to kill Ronald Reagan in 1981, are deranged.</p>
      <p>But most president-killers share certain characteristics: resentment, a desire to get even, a yen for fame, a determination to shape history or to reverse its tide.</p>
      <p>Usually the assassin is young, and American - Oswald was 24 when he killed John F. Kennedy, Booth was 27. Often they summon up the base courage to kill under the influence of drugs or drink. The word "assassin" derives from "hashish", the drug of choice for the Nizaris, the 11th-century Arab sect whose members acted as political contract killers. The men arrested in Denver allegedly had methamphetamines in their car, along with their high-powered rifles.</p>
      <p>There is also, crucially, a copycat element to American assassinations. Sirhan was obsessed with the murder of President McKinley in 1901, and had been reading about the killing of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914. Arthur Bremer read books about Sirhan, Oswald and Booth before shooting the presidential candidate George Wallace in 1972.</p>
      <p>Hinckley had a biography of Oswald, but was also fixated by the film Taxi Driver, in which the deranged and alienated main character is inspired, in large part, by the diaries of Bremer. Assassins feed off one another.</p>
      <p>The first presidential assassination took place in a theatre, and political assassination in the US seems to follow a set dramatic pattern: a killer opens fire in a public place, brings down supreme power with a bullet; brief evasion, then capture. As the American psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton wrote: "What turns out to be most consistent about American assassins is the structure of the act, so consistent in fact, that we may begin to think of it as a theatrical convention."</p>
      <p>The assassination plot has engrained itself into American popular culture - numberless television re-enactments of the murders, countless conspiracy theories, anniversary memorials, even a Broadway musical, Assassins, by Stephen Sondheim.</p>
      <p>Assassins kill for the thrill of fame, for political ends, and because the gun, so thoroughly saturated into American life, is such an easy way to erase the difference between the powerful and the powerless. In a flash of self revelation after his arrest, Hinckley remarked: "Guns are neat little things, aren't they? They can kill extraordinary people with very little effort."</p>
      <p>Assassins also kill in imitation of earlier killings. Political murder has changed American history in the past, and would-be assassins know it, however blinkered, insane or ignorant they may be.</p>
      <p>With the extraordinary security surrounding Mr Obama, only the most expert assassin could realistically hope to get within range of the candidate, yet the unimpressive group arrested this week apparently believed that it was worth taking up that well-rehearsed role. In practice, presidential assassination may be next to impossible; but in psychological terms, it is an ever-present in American life.</p>
      <p>This is surely what Ms Lessing, a novelist uniquely attuned to the power of narrative, meant when she referred to the probability that "they" would attempt to murder Mr Obama: the saga of American presidential assassination is so familiar, so often rehearsed, that someone will always be angry or mad enough to try to write another dreadful chapter.</p>
      <p>On this occasion, a tragedy seems to have been averted, but the threat of political assassination remains rooted in American culture; and that is the enduring tragedy.</p>

      <title>In for the long haul with the tech funds</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Mark Colegate says that some investors will be in for a shock when the shakeout comes in tech stocks</p>
      <p>Web fever has reached British shores, pushing technology stocks to new highs. But though technology may be all the rage with investors, they must be prepared for a bumpy ride - this is a volatile sector.</p>
      <p>The most important point, hammered home by the managers of technology funds themselves and leading independent financial advisers, is that the sector is a long-term play and should not be seen as a short-term punt.</p>
      <p>Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lans-down, an independent financial adviser, says: "Anyone buying a fund should be taking a ten-year view. Everyone likes technology at the moment because the shares are going up but only when they drop 40 per cent will some investors really realise what the downside can be."</p>
      <p>David Magliocco, a member of the team that runs the Henderson Global Technology unit trust, is very much in agreement with this. He cites the characteristics of a US technology index, the SoundView IT 100, as an example of how these stocks behave. He says: "This has everything from large to small companies in it. Since 1990 the average year included a 24 per cent sell-off. Despite that, the typical annual return was still 41 per cent."</p>
      <p>In 1990 the index recorded its largest fall of the year, with investors selling off 38 per cent. Over the year, the total index fell 4 per cent. But in 1999, the index jumped 130 per cent and the sharpest drop was just 14 per cent. It has been these sort of returns, accompanied by the booming interest in the Internet, that has helped to whet the appetite of investors.</p>
      <p>At the same time, investment houses have been quick to try to service that need. Aberdeen Asset Managers, Henderson Investors and Scottish Equitable have long records in the sector but there are plenty of newer players in the market, including SG Asset Management, Framlington and Premier Portfolio Managers.</p>
      <p>Last autumn Close Fund Managers brought out a UK index tracker fund, the techMARK, and this year big name groups such as Jupiter and Gartmore are looking to launch into the market while Aberdeen is converting an existing unit trust into a European technology fund.</p>
      <p>Under Pep regulations, an investor could only put Pounds 1,500 a year into a technology fund but the rules covering Isas are far broader - allowing an individual to put in up to Pounds 7,000 in this tax year and Pounds 5,000 in subsequent years. With strong returns being generated by the market and with the prospect of large lump sum investments in the run up to April 5, groups are very keen to tempt potential investors.</p>
      <p>While there is plenty of advertising and marketing spend to encourage investors, it is worth remembering that the phenomenal growth figures quoted in the advertisements are all gains made in the past.</p>
      <p>Wai Man Cheung, principal at WMC Investment Managers, a Southampton IFA, says investors should consider previous markets that offered high returns and then went badly wrong, such as Japan for most of the 1990s. Even so, he says that the long term tecnology outlook is compelling.</p>
      <p>The investment principle is simple: technology is becoming more and more prevalent so it makes sense to invest in businesses that provide the tools that transform the economy and our way of life. These, after all, should be able to create huge new markets for goods.</p>
      <p>Ben Rogoff, part of the technology team at Aberdeen Asset Managers, says: "We think of technology in a broad sense so it includes electronics, biotech, medical products, semi conductors, hardware companies, software businesses, the Internet and telecom stocks."</p>
      <p>This year newspapers have been full of examples of Internet businesses, the so-called "dot.com companies", that are valued in millions of pounds despite having little or no revenues. Rogoff is keen to stress that technology fund managers as a breed tend to avoid most of these companies like the plague and see this part of the market as a bubble that will sooner or later burst.</p>
      <p>At Aberdeen, one investment strategy the team is using to play the Internet theme is to invest in businesses that provide services to the dot.com companies. The argument is simple: some dot.com companies will survive, others will go bust, but all of them will need to pay for expertise to get them on to the Internet and functioning properly.</p>
      <p>The majority of tech companies are in the US and the asset allocation of funds reflects this. Mr Magliocco says the Henderson unit trust has 60 per cent exposure to this market with about 20 per cent in Europe including the UK and the rest in Asia and Japan. The Premier Technology fund has similar weightings with 64.5 per cent in the US, 19 per cent in Europe, 7 per cent in the UK, 7 per cent in Japan and Asia and 2.5 per cent in cash.</p>
      <p>Mr Rogoff says that while technology is a global theme, North America is ultimately the market leader. He says: "In Asia the companies are mainly manufacturers. They are producing products but the benefits are flowing to somewhere else in the world."</p>
      <p>While there are plenty of technology funds, several investment houses are bringing out broader-based themed portfolios that include, but are not entirely dependent on, technology. Investec Guinness Flight has launched its Wired Index fund. This invests in so-called "new economy" companies, that are anticipating the changes to the way business works and are taking advantage of them. The fund, which tracks an index set up by US magazine Wired, buys into companies that use technology effectively rather than the technology companies.</p>
      <p>Philip Saunders, director at Investec Guinness Flight, says hotels group Marriott is a good example of such a business, as it has huge information databases on its customers allowing it to tailor its hotel chains to their needs.</p>
      <p>Whatever the attractions of technology, anyone who goes into a technology fund really has to consider where it fits in with their overall portfolio of investments, says Mr Dampier. He adds that it could be worth investing in the higher risk/reward fund at the same time as putting an investment in a more sedate vehicle with a proven track record of good equity returns.</p>
      <p>In his case he says he has tended to buy the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, a Pounds 2.3 billion portfolio which allocates shares across all the world's markets, as a useful ballast for a tech fund.</p>

      <author>David Aaronovitch; Body; The Great Pretender The Undercover Mission That Changed Our Understanding of Madness; by Susannah Cahalan; Canongate, 400pp; £16.99; We have a linear idea of medical progress. Each year medical science makes a new discovery. Each year we develop a new treatment. Each year we improve. And by and large that's true. But not always. Progress can not only be slow, it can sometimes be halted or even reversed for a while if the medical establishment commits itself to a course that turns out to be mistaken. And in one field in particular, psychiatry, where it is the mind that seems to be ill, the terrain is littered with failed treatments, professional disputes, unresolved controversies and - above all - a lack of confidence in diagnosing disease.; The world of postwar American psychiatry is the backdrop for Susannah Cahalan's The Great Pretender. Cahalan, a former journalist on a New York tabloid, has a particular interest. A few years ago she suffered a prolonged psychotic episode including hallucinatory bedbugs and persecuting nurses, was diagnosed as being mentally ill and prescribed anti-psychotic drugs. Fortunately, a new physician thought to give her extra tests and discovered that her condition was a product of a physical illness. She wrote a book about her experience, Brain on Fire, "but once you've come face to face with real madness and returned," she writes in her new book, "once you've found yourself to be a bridge between the two worlds, you can never turn your back again".; So what she has done here is essentially to write a brief history of psychiatry, its difficulties and missteps. She reminds us of some of the bizarre and even cruel treatments that doctors would inflict on their patients. From a century and a half's distance it is almost possible to laugh at "baths of surprise", where the afflicted was put in a room and the floor would collapse, pitching them into a vat of very cold water. The idea being to shock them into their wits, apparently.; The trouble with laughing is that the principle of such a treatment does not seem that far away from early forms of electroshock therapy and the much more recent practice of lobotomisation - cutting part of the brain out.; Looming over all, of course, is the dark image of the asylum - a horror of the imagination in which the insane and the wrongly diagnosed are incarcerated with each other and, essentially, left to rot by an embarrassed world. This living hell was penetrated by intrepid journalism as early as 1887, when the reporter Nellie Bly got herself committed to the asylum on Blackwell's (now Roosevelt) Island in the East River in New York. When she managed to get out she told a story of minor sadism and major neglect.; These are more enlightened days. For the most part psychiatry's mistakes have been committed in the earnest desire to improve the lives of those who suffer. But the problem has always been to decide what exactly it is that they are suffering from. We know what measles is. You know what a bacterial infection is. You can see a cancer. You can measure the electrical storm that is an epileptic fit. But what do you see in the microscope or the biopsy when someone is suffering delusions? To open up this question Cahalan decided to follow up on an experiment that changed the face of American psychiatric practice. This experiment began in February 1969 when a psychologist called David Rosenhan presented himself at a psychiatric hospital claiming to be suffering from auditory hallucinations. Specifically he said he heard a voice repeating the words "empty", "hollow" and "thud".; Rosenhan was diagnosed with schizophrenia, admitted and given anti-psychotic drugs. Over the subsequent days he acted completely normally, took notes on what happened and how he was treated, and how long it took him to be allowed to leave.; At the same time seven other "pseudopatients" linked to Rosenhan were doing exactly the same thing at other institutions. In 1973 Rosenhan wrote up their experiences in a paper for the highly regarded journal Science under the title of On Being Sane in Insane Places. It was both an attack on the diagnosing practices of the psychiatric profession and on the conditions in psychiatric hospitals.; The publication was a sensation and, as Cahalan points out, On Being Sane in Insane Places is still taught in Psych 101 in the US. Rosenhan's revelation also benefited from being at one with the mental health zeitgeist. The "anti-psychiatry" movement was in full swing. In 1962 Ken Kesey had published his extraordinary book One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which became an award-winning film in 1975. For many people Kesey's nightmarish vision was to constitute all they really knew about psychiatric hospitals.; As I read Cahalan's account of Rosenhan's experiment I became uneasy. After all, what symptoms would someone suffering from the collection of symptoms dubbed "schizophrenia" exhibit other than self-described ones? Was it so preposterous for the pseudopatients to be admitted based on their own accounts? Even so I wasn't really prepared for the story Cahalan ends up telling. That she discovered the truth about Rosenhan is a testimony to her dogged research. That this truth was inconvenient for her own outlook on psychiatry is a compliment to her integrity. She writes it all very well too, with clarity, economy and style.; And the truth is that Rosenhan was a fraud. What Cahalan's research showed was that there were probably only two "pseudopatients" (Rosenhan and one other), that the accounts of their hospitalisation were fabricated, and that in one case where a genuine pseudopatient had experiences that did not fit with Rosenhan's thesis, he was excluded from the study.; Cahalan's tone is gentle and she quotes friends of Rosenhan - who was obviously a charismatic figure - defending him. Was it really so bad? Wasn't he right, after all, even if he cut a few corners? It won't do. One of the most influential postwar pieces of writing about psychiatric treatment was a fraud. A con. And furthermore it was a con that was instrumental in intensifying the process of closing down America's psychiatric hospitals. When Rosenhan began his "experiment" there were half a million beds in more than 300 state and county mental hospitals. Today there are 45,000.; And if some dark, bad places have gone, so too have some good and enlightened ones. And in their place - nothing. Or worse than nothing. What has happened has not been "deinstitutionalisation" but what some American academics have called "transinstitutionalisation". In 2017 the US justice department estimated that nearly 40 per cent of prison inmates were suffering from mental illness and more than a quarter were actually psychotic.; If ever there were a place for a new Bly to discover the modern horrors of mental health treatment, the American prison system is likely to be it.; Patients were pitched into a vat of cold water to shock them into their wits</author>

      <title>The Bulldozer gains election by a landslide with pledge to lift economy</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The man known as The Bulldozer swept into power in South Korea yesterday, dealing a humiliating blow to the left of centre liberals who have ruled the country for more than a decade. The conservative Lee Myung Bak, a former executive with Hyundai, overcame allegations of financial fraud to gain almost half of all the votes cast, a feat unseen in South Korea since the rigged elections of the former military dictatorship.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee has promised to take a sterner approach in engaging Kim Jong Il, the Stalinist dictator of North Korea, and to rebuild Seoul's strained friendship with the United States. Above all, his victory is an expression of the anxieties of South Koreans about their economy, as they struggle to compete with China.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee gained 48.7 per cent of the vote, compared with 26.2 per cent for his closest rival, the liberal Chung Dong Young. "I will serve the people in a very humble way," he told supporters of his Grand National Party last night. "In accordance with the wishes of the people, I will save the nation's economy as it faces crisis."</p>
      <p>A menacing shadow hangs over Mr Lee's triumph -an investigation into persistent allegations of fraud that relate to a company once run by the president-elect and a former business partner who faces prosecution. Mr Lee denies any wrongdoing and South Korean prosecutors decided recently that he had no case to answer.</p>
      <p>South Korea's parliament, however, has commissioned an independent investigation that could lead to charges of manipulating the price of shares. If charges were made later than Mr Lee's inauguration on February 25 then, as a sitting president, he would technically be immune to prosecution.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee's victory came on his 66th birthday and his 37th wedding anniversary. He was born in 1941 in wartime Japan, the son of poor parents who lived for a few years as economic migrants in Osaka. The Korean War in the 1950s brought more suffering to the family after their return home, including the deaths of his two siblings. As a schoolboy, Mr Lee had to fill himself up with water to fend off the pangs of hunger; later he worked as an ice-cream seller. He worked his way through the elite Korea University in Seoul, joined the Hyundai Group and by the age of 36 had become head of its construction arm, where he acquired his nickname "The Bulldozer" for his ability to overcome obstacles.</p>
      <p>He promises to raise annual economic growth by 7 per cent, to increase annual per capita income to $40,000 (£ 20,000) a year and to make South Korea the seventh-largest economy in the world, from its current position as number 11.</p>
      <p>Internationally, he will attempt to improve the awkward relationship with George Bush that has developed under Roh Moo Hyun, the outgoing President. He has promised to demand more in return for South Korea's investments in North Korea. In practice, though, negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons programme are going unprecedentedly well, and no incoming president can afford to jeopardise them.</p>

      <title>Bin Laden -- the wrong target?</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>By concentrating all its energy on Osama bin Laden, the West is in danger of overlooking an enemy who could as easily be in Ealing as in Kandahar, argues Paddy Ashdown</p>
      <p>What frightens me more than anything else in this crisis is our dangerous obsession with simplicities. Let us assume for the moment that "Osama Bin Laden" was responsible for the atrocities in the US last week and that we must take this "war" to where he is -in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>I shall explain the reasons for the quotation marks around Bin Laden's name later.</p>
      <p>But first of all some facts about Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>We talk of Afghanistan as though it were a single, unified country -a sort of Netherlands with mountains and a lot of mad mullahs.</p>
      <p>Nothing could be farther from the truth. Afghanistan is fractured, divided and, when not at war with outsiders, has been almost permanently at war with itself.</p>
      <p>Imagine Afghanistan as a box. Now draw two horizontal lines through it, dividing it into three equal portions. The top band is the home of the Tadjiks who speak Farsi (Persian) with Mazar-e Sharif as their principal town. The lower band is mostly Pashtuns who speak Pushtu, look south to Pakistan and have Kandahar as their capital.</p>
      <p>In the central band, draw a dot in the middle and around that draw a circle which touches the lines above and below. This is the Hazarajat. Hazarajat means "land of the thousand" and its people derive from a quirk of history. Genghis Khan's warriors roamed in bands of a thousand horsemen known as Hazara. Unfortunately for their descendants (who are Shia Muslims, unlike the majority in Afghanistan), the Mongol tide withdrew, leaving them trapped in the high plateau of central Afghanistan. The Hazara are physically different from other Afghans, being of Mongol appearance. They have no major town and are the underdogs of Afghan society.</p>
      <p>To the left of the Hazarajat circle is the great city of Herat, which belongs to the Tadjiks. To the right is the capital, Kabul, which belongs to the Pashtuns. In the middle is a muddle of the two of them.</p>
      <p>Historically, power in Afghanistan belongs largely to the Pashtuns, but the Tadjiks are the educated elite and hold many of the administrative posts.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan's politics are, if anything, even more fractious and divided than its ethnic mix. And one of the reasons for this is Western policy.</p>
      <p>During the Soviet-Afghan war, the West sought to hide its hand in Afghanistan by using Pakistan as our "front". We secretly provided weapons and cash to the guerrillas (including bin Laden) and left it to Pakistan to handle the day-to-day administration of the war: cash, arms distribution, etc. It was a task that the Pakistanis carried out with enthusiasm -and an appropriate share of the cash as it passed through their hands.</p>
      <p>After the Soviets left, the West lost interest. But Pakistan, with severe enough problems of its own, was left to cope with the backwash of chaos and conflict in its volatile neighbour. It decided that it had to have a hand in who won the civil war which followed. It chose an incompetent, anti-Western Islamic fundamentalist, Gulbadin Hekmatyar, as its instrument and actively encouraged the involvement of Arabs from the Middle East with money (eg, bin Laden). Note: Afghans are not Arabs. Arabs, too, are foreigners in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Despite massive logistical and material support (including manpower) from Pakistan, Hekmatyar failed.</p>
      <p>Pakistan tried again, this time through the creation of a new group called the Taleban, which in Arabic means "the seekers", so cloaking Pakistan's agenda in a new Islamic coat.</p>
      <p>Now go back to our "square" map of Afghanistan. The right-hand side of the square represents the border with Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Colour in a series of red dots as close to this edge as possible, but no higher than the first horizontal line marking the northern limits of Pashtun territory. These are the bases, some of them academies of death, of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist organisation, al-Qaeda. They contain about 10,000 men.</p>
      <p>It is no accident that these red spots are close to the border with Pakistan. Establishing them depended on Pakistani help. You should not be too shocked, if you arrived at one of these camps for tea, to find not only a mix of Arab students from many nations, but also Pakistanis preparing to meet Allah in Kashmir.</p>
      <p>But al-Qaeda is not just a suicide organisation. It also has a private army, the 055 Brigade, numbering perhaps 2,000 to 3,000. These shock troops are used frequently by the Taleban in their war against other factions, most notably the United Front, whose moderate, pro-Western leader, the gifted and charismatic Ahmad Shah Masood, was assassinated by suicide bombers just before the attack on the USA last week (probably as part of the same operation).</p>
      <p>But what is important is that al-Qaeda's agenda differs significantly from that of the Taleban. It is not concerned with creating an independent Afghan Islamic state. In the long term there can be no room for the Taleban in its ambitions. Having being artificially introduced to the region, it has grown in confidence and stature. It is important also to understand that while members of 055 Brigade might serve with Taleban forces, they are not, in any Western sense, integrated. They remain rather like an international brigade, different in their language, habit, interpretation of Islam and vision of the future of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Contrary to Western received wisdom, fundamentalism of the sort practised by the Taleban is rather alien to the majority of ordinary Afghans, who wear their attachment to Islam lightly, enjoying music, dancing, radio and sports. But if the ordinary Afghan has mixed feelings about the Taleban, he will feel even more ambivalent about bin Laden's private army, who are mostly foreign Arabs. If there is one thing an Afghan dislikes more than being told what to do by another Afghan, it is being told what to do by a foreigner, even if he is a fellow Muslim. This, and the growing rivalry with the Taleban, are bin Laden's Achilles' heels.</p>
      <p>So, if we have to act militarily against bin Laden (and I suspect that we now do), then we should: a) make it big enough to satisfy the desire for retribution which has been generated in the US, but b) make it limited enough to prevent further destabilisation and, most important of all, c) make it in a way which widens the fissures between bin Laden and his Afghan hosts (including the Taleban), rather than welding these over in a common front against an external enemy.</p>
      <p>The safest way to do this would be by helping other Afghans who already oppose the Taleban, and their temporary alliance with al-Qaeda, to clean up their country. And there are plenty to choose from.</p>
      <p>There was an uprising against the Taleban in the city of Khost last year. There are 50,000 Shia Muslims who live around Bamian and have no love for the Sunni Taleban.</p>
      <p>And there are pockets of outright resistance, too: one bordering Iran to the west of Herat; another next to Turkmenistan, centred on Faryab and controlled by an Uzbeki warlord, Abdul Dostum, who has a long history of swapping allegiances; a further small pocket, allied to Ahmad Shah Masood's United Front, around the town of Asadabad. And there is, finally, the United Front itself, now led after Masood's assassination by General Mohammad Fakhim.</p>
      <p>But if "attacking Afghanistan" requires a little more subtlety than the easy simplicities sometimes represented in our papers, what to do in such an attack is even more difficult.</p>
      <p>I am not going to speculate on military options. We should leave the military a decent area of obscurity to get on with their task. But one point is worth making. Bombing alone would simply rearrange the rubble, which is all that is left of much of this desperate country.</p>
      <p>Some say we should "bomb Afghanistan back to the Stone Age". The problem is, this has already been done by the Soviets. Can we make them suffer? Not much more than they already do. Can we level their houses? Turn their schools to rubble? Eradicate their hospitals? Destroy their infrastructure? Too late. Someone has already done that, too.</p>
      <p>This time, I fear, if we are serious, we will have to part company with the comfortable concept of fighting a casualty-less war from 15,000ft.</p>
      <p>Next we need to consider the name on everyone's lips: that of Osama bin Laden. The presumption on behalf of almost everyone (encouraged, probably unintentionally, by Western leaders) is that this man is a kind of Muslim Dr No -the evil mastermind planning, funding, executing and directing a campaign of worldwide terrorism.</p>
      <p>That bin Laden is not the kind of man you would like to have dinner with, I have no doubt. But to presume that he is the single directing intelligence behind all this is fatally to underestimate our difficulties and the complexity of the action we have to take.</p>
      <p>Osama bin Laden may well be the major funder, perhaps even spiritual guru, of the terrorist networks we are fighting. But beyond that, his is merely the name which has floated to the top of a witches' brew of organisations which are diffuse, decentralised, appear and disappear, change their names and composition, and have occasional contacts with states but can act alone, though they more often do so in constantly shifting alliances with others. It is perfectly possible that bin Laden knew neither the date nor the nature, nor even the target, of the horrors of last week.</p>
      <p>What we are dealing with is not a single, supremely evil "mad mullah" sitting in a cave in Afghanistan and plotting to destroy the world, but rather a widespread network of terror, the tentacles of which probably reach deep into almost all its target countries (remember how much the US helped in training those who attacked it?). The danger is that we have concentrated so much on the name of bin Laden that we believe that if only we can "get him" it will all end.</p>
      <p>It won't.</p>
      <p>I don't much like the language of war which is being so widely used. But if this is a war, it has to be fought on many fronts and at many levels, some visible, some invisible. So far the terror networks have been disrupting our home bases, forcing us to change the way we live and provoking us to overreaction. So far we have almost completely failed to disrupt the areas in which they work -which are not, as so many seem to believe, in a single country such as Afghanistan, but in every country and in none.</p>
      <p>They operate across borders. They will have used the very international systems that they attacked in the World Trade Centre to move the huge sums of money needed to fund last week's horrors. They use our systems of easy and anonymous travel to move the people and weapons to prepare their attacks. They use the Internet to form their alliances and to co-ordinate their actions. This is where they operate. And this is where we have to operate too, using the same underground systems that they use to disrupt them and destroy their means of working.</p>
      <p>Messrs Blair and Bush are right in stressing that this will be a long, hard slog. They are wrong in seeming to place so much emphasis on a single name and a single place. I suspect that our real difficulty will not be how we deal with bin Laden if we can find him, but how we deal with the subversive network operating from a newsagent's in Ealing. Our battleground will be as much about winning the hearts and minds of disaffected Muslim youth in Bradford as about establishing military bases in the Hindu Kush. If we really want to stem the supply of suicide bombers for the future, we need look no farther than the conditions of the 1.9 million Arabs who have been trapped, hopeless, in Palestinian refugees camps for half a century now.</p>
      <p>The question for us will be not just what military weapons we use, but on what civil liberties we are prepared to compromise. The anonymity of bank transactions and secret accounts. Our easy freedom of travel. Whether we will allow our external intelligence services to operate more freely in domestic territory. Whether we permit unbreakable personal codes to be used on the Internet. Identity cards.</p>
      <p>This is going to be a long campaign if we are to win it. But it will not be solved by picking a single man and a single country, or by allowing the belief that victory comes with a single strike, however much people in their pain want it to be otherwise.</p>

      <subtitle>Keeley Hawes tells Andrew Billen how starring in a new drama by JK Rowling has capped the best year of her life</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The best laid plans, and so on ... Keeley Hawes has chosen to meet for coffee in London's coolest garden centre, conveniently near her home in Twickenham. The Petersham Nurseries in southwest London is so posh its café won a Michelin star a few years ago. The actress, however, awoke with a savage cold at 4am and unable to sleep spent the early hours watching House Doctor repeats on television.</p>
      <p>So now here she is, exhausted and full of cold, talking to me over coffee - make hers a Lemsip - in a drafty commercial greenhouse on a freezing morning. The reason we meet is to discuss her role in the new BBC drama, The Casual Vacancy, adapted from a JK Rowling novel notable for its lack of wizards. It was filmed, tauntingly, during last year's endless summer.</p>
      <p>Not even phlegm and January, however, can dim the brilliant memories of the past 12 months. They began with Hawes receiving the notices of her life for her portrayal of Lindsay Denton, the troubled, more sinned against than sinning cop in the second series of Jed Mercurio's Line of Duty. It went on with her playing a villainous intergalactic banker in Doctor Who and a part in the next season of BBC Shakespeare histories. The year ended with her husband Matthew Macfadyen receiving rave reviews as the star of the new season of Ripper Street. "You should never say this, I suppose, but it's been one of the nicest years of my life," she says, "one of the best years of my life, really."</p>
      <p>Now The Casual Vacancy, in which she co-stars with Michael Gambon, Julia McKenzie and Simon McBurney, is about to propel her back into the public imagination. It features Hawes, as they say, as you have never seen her, playing Sam the tarty owner of a Victoria's Secrets-style lingerie shop who likes to model its wares.</p>
      <p>"She is incredibly well-endowed - much more voluptuous than me after three children," she says, explaining that the desired effects were achieved with Marks &amp; Spencer underwear and clothes a size too small. "They used a different lens for different people in the show. It is so clever. Mine was a wide lens to get my boobs and arse into the shot."</p>
      <p>Comparisons with Line of Duty are entirely redundant, except to say that because of Rowling and the big-name cast, expectations will be high. The odds did not look so great for Line of Duty a year ago. It was after all a follow-up to the original hit series two years before - and, as Broadchurch has discovered, that can be hard. The production was hit by casting problems when Robert Lindsay left the line-up citing "mutual creative differences".</p>
      <p>When it started, ratings were lower than for season one. Then they grew and the nation caught on that Hawes was producing an incredible portrait of surly melancholy that was also weirdly attractive. In the 2014 Crime Thriller awards she won the Best Actress dagger; further nominations are surely to come. Does she think she's cracked it now? At 39, she's finally got the recognition she deserves? (I am a fan but as a critic have been hard on her in the past, both in Ashes to Ashes and BBC's Upstairs Downstairs exhumation.) "I don't www.know.No, I wouldn't like to say." Better not push it that far? "No, let's not go mad."</p>
      <p>One of the things about Hawes, although you might not guess it from the way she is habitually cast (an exception was Ambassadors in 2013), is that she is incredibly funny. When I first interviewed her in 2006, shortly after she gave birth to her third child, she was so skittish that I accused her of suffering from postnatal euphoria. Yet she revealed last year that to play Denton she had drawn on her own experience of "chemical", rather than reactive, depression. It descended on her first when she was 17, just after she had left her parents' home.</p>
      <p>So she was alone? "There's no other way really of being depressed. You can't really be depressed with other people. It's not like a group thing. You don't want to be with other people." How long did it go on for? "It is on and off really, but I have learnt the signs. I was never bipolar but you start to know the signs. I just refused to go through that. I went to the doctor then. When there's something wrong with you, you take pills. You wouldn't say, 'Well, I'm just going to see this out.' I've tried that. I thought, 'I don't need this.' And clearly I do and it doesn't mean that I'm out of touch with my feelings. I'm far too in touch with my feelings. And I know myself well enough now to know that it's always great to have a goal."</p>
      <p>small goal, maybe? "It could be going for a walk every day or it could be learning to row, which I'm going to do. So I've beenvery free of it for a while and I'm very happy." I wonder how Lindsay is doing, I find myself saying aloud. "I often wonder how she is. I love that people have said - on Twitter or in letters - 'She was really real to me. How's she doing now?' That's the highest compliment."</p>
      <p>Her success as Denton followed a particular low for her, comparable, she says, to her first attack of depression 30 year earlier. Just before Christmas 2013 she had walked out of a West End show, Barking in Essex, before the end of its run, reportedly after a series of altercations with her co-star Sheila Hancock, who was said to have criticised her vocal projection. Hawes says it would be therapeutic to tell me all, "but there is a code of conduct - there just is, isn't there?" Suffice to say she and Hancock did not exchange Christmas cards.</p>
      <p>"It was one of the worst experiences of my life. You don't walk out of a West End show lightly." How did she get past it? "Time. Time continues to heal. And the year that I've had and working with the people I've worked with." And it became the best year of her life? "It'll be something to remember: how things can just turn on a sixpence. You go from the depths of something to something wonderful. I've got my faith back in people."</p>
      <p>And maybe in herself? "Yes and now I do feel that if people don't like me, they don't like me. I'm much more relaxed about it. We're not curing cancer. Not everything can be a masterpiece and some of the things that aren't masterpieces are some of the best things. Casual Vacancy was so lovely. Nobody ever says something was a nightmare, but it was genuinely a wonderful thing to work on."</p>
      <p>She describes the three-part Vacancy as "Dickens without corsets", loads of characters all slightly heightened. Adapted by Sarah Phelps, who wrote the BBC Great Expectations a few years ago, it is also about class, a clash between Cotswolds wealth and the despised and feared dwellers of the nearby (yet in other ways far distant) Fields council estate.</p>
      <p>As the daughter of a London cabby and the youngest of four children brought up in a three-bedroom council flat, Hawes might be expected to accept my invitation to weigh into the current debate on the dominance of public schoolboys in acting today.</p>
      <p>She is reluctant to do so, pointing out that Abigail Lawrie, who plays Krystal, the daughter of a heroin addict, in Vacancy, is "extraordinary" and was cast without having done a day's acting in her life. When she attended the Sylvia Young theatre school as a teenager her fees were subsidised - "and those grants are out there".</p>
      <p>Perhaps it would be inappropriate for Hawes to claim solidarity with working-class actors when her husband went to a public school and her three children (the eldest by her first husband, cartoonist Spencer McCallum) are being privately educated. Wasn't it a struggle to get to where she is? "I found it a struggle to keep sane to the point where I am now because it's a tricky business."</p>
      <p>The rejection? The criticism? "The rejection. The criticism. Everything. Everybody faces that. I remember once Matthew got a letter saying that a part had been offered to people of the Leonardo DiCaprio level and if they turn it down it will be shown to so-and-so and if they say no, we might consider seeing you." The C-list? "Right." Yet now she is on the A-list, cast in next year's BBC production of Shakespeare's Henry VI and Richard III. She plays Queen Elizabeth, mother of the twins in the Tower.</p>
      <p>Her first scene was with Dame Judi Dench. Beyond an audition speech as Ophelia, she had never uttered a line of Shakespeare in her life. "I owned right up to Judi Dench in rehearsal. I said, 'I've never done this and I don't know what I'm doing.' And she said, 'How have you managed to get away with that?' And actually I could not have been in better hands. I'm completely in love with Judi Dench and I don't care who knows it."</p>
      <p>Who plays Richard III? "Benedict Cumberbatch. Oh God. I just thought if they need to recast me, they'll recast, but here I still am." And never more so. Keeley Hawes is cold. Keeley Hawes is hot. The Casual Vacancy begins on Sunday February 15 on BBC One</p>
      <p>I owned right up to Judi Dench in rehearsal: 'I've never done this'</p>

      <title>Message in a bottle for the NHS</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>As the Government wrestles with the challenge of transforming the National Health Service, it is likely to look around the world in search of best practice. This is unlikely to provide large amounts of inspiration. Examples of high performing, innovative, state-of-the-art state monopolies are few.</p>
      <p>But all is not lost. In their quest for inspiration, Government ministers should sit themselves down in the Commons' bar and order a stiff vodka. For those committed to state-run enterprises, Absolut vodka is the drink of choice.</p>
      <p>Absolut is one of the business success stories of the last 20 years. The Swedish vodka brand has come from nowhere to become a global branding phenomenon. Absolut is the third biggest premium spirits brand in the world -behind Bacardi and Smirnoff -and is available in 125 markets, not bad when you consider that it was introduced in the US only in 1979. Some 400,000 bottles are produced every day.</p>
      <p>Yet, Absolut is owned by Sweden's Vin &amp; Sprit (V&amp;S), which was founded in 1917 to give the Swedish Government control over the country's supply of alcohol. Though the Swedish market is now open and 300 companies have the right to import alcoholic drinks, V&amp;S is still controlled by Sweden's Ministry of Finance. Indeed, V&amp;S brings sizeable revenues to the Swedish state. Its profits for 2001 were the highest ever: 2,159 million Swedish Krona (Pounds 144 million).</p>
      <p>Carl Hamilton, the author of Absolut: Biography of a Bottle, tells a story about a speech in California. His subject was the rise of Absolut and his audience a group of American executives. When Mr Hamilton revealed that the company which produces Absolut was state-owned, the recognition flickered in the audience: every dollar they spent on Absolut actually helped to support the Swedish social welfare system.</p>
      <p>V&amp;S has succeeded largely through its commitment to being different. State owned monopolies are not renowned for their capacity to take risks or be imaginative. V&amp;S has. It acts like a commercial organisation. "Whether it is state-owned or not is not really an issue. We operate like any other company apart from the fact of our ownership," says the Absolut chief executive, Goran Lundqvist. He says Absolut considers the US its home market. "Perhaps that's the secret. Sweden is where we manufacture and make decisions, but we grow from the US out into the world," he says. "You have to be very local when you speak to consumers. You have to understand the market."</p>
      <p>The lesson for the NHS is that thinking differently is critical. If more money is supplied to the NHS and business as usual continues, we are unlikely to witness a transformation.</p>
      <p>The team behind Absolut's creation was fixated with eing different. At the time of Absolut's inception, at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the Eighties, the generic strategy to crack the spirits market was to have a big bottle with a Russian name and a large label with crests and crowns. Absolut did the opposite.</p>
      <p>Instead of a bright and colourful label filled with czars on horseback, Absolut's inspiration was an antique medicine bottle and it decided against having any label at all. Doomsayers in the spirits and advertising businesses warned of the folly. The Absolut team forged on, ensuring as much as possible that the company's board was kept out of the brand development. Herein lies another lesson for the NHS: change is more likely to come from initiatives at local level than from grand, countrywide schemes led by phalanxes of senior managers. A small internal group dedicated to changing ingrained practices is more likely to transform thinking and behaviour.</p>
      <p>The final lesson from Absolut is that the product must be backed by marketing. Absolut's advertising campaign has won plaudits and awards worldwide. It was listed among the ten best advertising campaigns of the past century by Advertising Age.</p>
      <p>The premise of the ads couldn't be more straightforward: an Absolut bottle in an unusual setting with a pithy line beginning with the word Absolut. So, we have Absolut Warhol, Absolut New Orleans (with a trumpet), Absolut Centrefold in Playboy with a naked bottle and so on. So good is the ad campaign that Richard Lewis's Absolut Book: The Absolut Vodka Advertising Story has sold 150,000 copies. When it comes to marketing, the comparisons with the NHS appear limited. But who knows what the NHS's core values are? What does it stand for? And, perhaps most pertinent of all: who is marketing the NHS? Who ensures that the people who work within the NHS and who use its services understand what it is there for and get the maximum benefit from it? Answers in a bottle.</p>

      <title>Dear Gregor, I'm your sister, would you like to meet me?</title>
      <subtitle>A new memoir by the actor Gregor Fisher, written with the Times columnist Melanie Reid, delves into family secrets. Further extracts tomorrow and Wednesday</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Please Note: This Book Extract is restricted to News UK users Only.</p>
      <p>The small boy remembered the day he arrived at John and Cis Leckie's house, at the tail end of 1957. It all seemed so simple, back then. He was only three years old and Cis was his mother. Of this he had no doubt. He remembered the day he arrived there because it was snowy and they drove him up to where she lived, at the very top of the hill. He needed a pee and they had to stop the car on the slope. He remembered the pattern his pee made in the snow.</p>
      <p>He was a sturdy, smiley little chap with heart-melting blond curls and bright blue eyes. That first night, when her husband was at work, Cis carried the child outside to the loo because in 1950s Scotland most people still had outside toilets. The house sat high up to the south above Glasgow and it was a cold, frosty night - he could see the city lights twinkling and he thought he'd died and gone to heaven.</p>
      <p>Safe, really safe, in Cis's arms, looking at the lights. Gregor Fisher, the little boy with the winning blue eyes, landed lucky.</p>
      <p>It was during one of those scones-and-jam family suppers when the mood had lifted because Mr Leckie had gone to work. There must have been a christening in the family because it was the subject of discussion. Churches, godparents, babies.</p>
      <p>Out of the blue, Gregor, unthinking, opened his mouth. "Where was I christened?" An awkward, loaded silence fell over the room; an ear pop of tension. Sensing something, and never slow at coming forward, Gregor repeated his question. Immediately the subject was changed. One of his sisters offered him another scone, his mother chipped in with a change of subject. Uh-oh, he thought.</p>
      <p>Preoccupied with himself, like all 14-year-olds, he picked up on the evasion, the awkwardness in the room. There was a mystery, some secret being withheld from him. Something that pertained to him, which everyone else was party to.</p>
      <p>Nothing more was said and he went to bed as usual. Then came a knock on his door - an unusual occurrence because it was the sort of household where no one locked or knocked on doors. His mother came into the room.</p>
      <p>"You're adopted," she said. She stood there awkwardly, looking at him, unsure what to do next. It was the classic, blunt-edged West of Scotland way of doing things. In the 1960s no one was schooled in communication and child psychology; no one read manuals on how to discuss sensitive issues with children. Unlike today, there weren't numerous books and websites on how to deal with an adopted child.</p>
      <p>What followed was a moment of most extraordinary drama. Cis was not given to physical demonstrativeness, but she reached out with her hand and patted her beloved son on the head. Not once. Twice. A single pat was unheard of. Two was a sign of almost uncontrollably high emotion. Cis was obviously as moved as she was uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>"We look after you now, you know. We wanted you, we love you," she muttered.</p>
      <p>And she turned and left the room.</p>
      <p>The letter arrived, out of the blue. It was summer, 1971. Gregor was still living down in the Borders, bouncing companionably around his Fisher relatives. He'd quit the wool factory and was doing bar work in the town, a goofy teenager killing time until he heard from drama school. The letter was brief.</p>
      <p>"Dear Gregor, I don't know if you remember me, I am your sister. Would you like to meet up at some point?" He was so taken aback that he didn't remember anything else it said. It was signed Maureen.</p>
      <p>He really didn't know anything about a sister. And he wasn't altogether sure he wanted to. In what was to become a lifelong habit when it came to turning over stones to see what was underneath, Gregor's initial reaction was wary. Suspicious. He didn't really know whether he was quite up to it or not. Emotion. Upset. Tears. Stuff. But then he thought, why not? So he borrowed Billy Bell's best suit and cousin Carol put him gently on the train to Glasgow, where the rendezvous had been arranged.</p>
      <p>Central Station, he'd suggested in his letter. But it's a huge concourse. Somehow, between the two of them, gauche teenagers, they chose to meet outside the lost property office. Well, every station has one, doesn't it? The pathos of it completely escaped them.</p>
      <p>So the short, stocky 18-year-old, in his borrowed farmer's suit and tie, green as the grass he'd watched from the train windows for the last 90 minutes, got off and made his way through the crowds.</p>
      <p>He hadn't a clue what she looked like, and they hadn't arranged to wear red roses, or carry rolled-up newspapers. So he stood there, awkward, self-conscious, looking at people, thinking, maybe that's her there ... maybe that's ... what does she look like? www....No, she's walked past.</p>
      <p>Then a little skinny girl approached and he thought it surely can't be her, because of all the things that Gregor Fisher never was, never has been, it was skinny.</p>
      <p>"Are you Gregor?" asked the girl. "Yup, right, that's me," he said. Pause.</p>
      <p>"You must be Maureen." What followed was an awkward, messy sort of hug between the two: the young, daft, embarrassed boy and his slightly older and more emotional sister.</p>
      <p>A mismatch of expectation and affection. Gregor didn't like hugging anyone, let alone weepy girls who were complete strangers. Maureen was hugging the long-lost adored little brother she had been so cruelly separated from. She had recognised him instantly - he hadn't changed from when he was a boy.</p>
      <p>They went for a cup of tea and started talking. Gregor felt awkward. He also felt immediately he was a disappointment to her. Gregor's life contained many stories and he was about to hear a completely new one. As well as getting to know each other again, he and his sister had a mystery to unravel. And Maureen knew far more about it than he did. The more she told him, the more unbelievable it all became, unfolding like a soap opera while their tea grew cold between them.</p>
      <p>She told him she had memories, although very, very faint, of being in a children's home with him - just the two of them, in cots, alone in a room.</p>
      <p>"Do you remember the red wellingtons?" she wanted to know. And to his amazement, out of the fog something stirred. He was in a room somewhere and there was a pair of red wellingtons in front of him. And because he was a little boy, and he needed a pee, he pulled down his pants and piddled in both boots.</p>
      <p>The image was clear in his head, now she had brought it back: the supreme satisfaction of doing something so neatly and cleverly. But he also remembered, afterwards, the repercussions - the sense of trouble and harsh words. So here they were, lost property, brother and sister, strangers to each other. What had been a taboo subject, a large, unwieldy mystery in their past, was no longer secret. Oh, there was still mystery, but illegitimacy was their new, unwelcome label. The stigma was still profound. Now, for the first time, they were forced to address a whole new raft of questions. Who were they? No, who were they really? [Gregor learns that his mother, an unmarried housewife called Kit McKenzie, died of a heart condition aged 38 when he was a baby, leading to his adoption. The subsequent death of his adoptive mother after a fire results in him being taken in by the Leckie family.] When his son Alexander was about a year old, Gregor was doing pantomime in Glasgow and had a free day on his hands. He and his birth sister Maureen decided, finally, to get a stick and prod the past. Together, they set off on an expedition to try to track down their mother's relatives, their unknown family, and find out what had happened. Maureen had got an address for an Aunt Ruby, who they believed was the elder sister of their mother, and they hatched the idea to go and see her. Gregor by this time was driving an ancient powder-blue Mercedes, which he thought was simply the business.</p>
      <p>He picked up Maureen and in their naivety they drove to Alloa, in Clackmannanshire, to say hello.</p>
      <p>Unannounced. It was the way Gregor preferred to do things.</p>
      <p>They went in the hope that Ruby, whoever she was, could fill in some of the blanks. They weren't trying to get written into any will, they just wanted to find out the circumstances of their births. By now they had a sense of a basic human right to know what everyone else took for granted - who their parents were.</p>
      <p>Gregor pulled up outside what he regarded as one of those Scottish "haven't-we-done-well" kind of houses - a semi, but granite, with a porch and pink gravel chips on the drive. He hated those pink chips then, and he hated them even more afterwards. Their feet crunched up the path. There was somebody working up a ladder outside. Christ, maybe that's our uncle, Gregor thought.</p>
      <p>They knocked on the door and a woman answered - smart, tweed skirt, twinset and pearls, sensible shoes with Cuban heels and a gold bar across the front. There were two or three steps up to the door, so they got the impression she was tall, but then both he and Maureen were quite short. They were looking up at her.</p>
      <p>"Yes, can I help you?" Well-spoken. "Er, perhaps you can. We're not here to disturb you in any way but I'm Gregor and this is Maureen. We're, erm, we're Catherine's, er, Kit's children."</p>
      <p>He saw immediately this was a mistake. Across his aunt's face everything registered, everything from shock, horror, guilt, sadness to "what will the neighbours think?" "Well, I'm terribly sorry but, ah, I have workmen in the house," she said and promptly shut the door.</p>
      <p>The encounter was over in seconds. So obviously, that wasn't Uncle up a ladder, thought Gregor drily as the two of them trailed back down the pink chips.</p>
      <p>Maureen burst into tears. "Get in the car, it doesn't matter, in the car, in the car!" he said, shepherding her, chivvying her.</p>
      <p>He helped her in and as he walked round to the driver's side, he glanced up at the house. The curtains twitched. They drove away, clocking up yet one more rejection in lives already shaped by such things.</p>
      <p>[Aunt Ruby eventually reveals that Gregor's father is called Bill Kerr. Gregor decides to find out more about him.] The reception area at the Sheriff Court had a tall wooden counter, and behind it sat an officiouslooking woman of middling years who obviously had to deal with the pretty mixed clientele who attended the court. Gregor got the firm impression she considered him one of them.</p>
      <p>"Ah, I believe I was adopted and the adoption was dealt with at Hamilton sheriff court ..." She looked at him. Maybe it was his imagination, but he got the idea she was less than impressed that some little illegitimate chappie had walked in.</p>
      <p>And she probably went twice to church on Sunday, but maybe that was Just me making more of it than what it was, but I didn't get a friendly kind of, 'Oh, come in, we'll get you a cup of tea,' there was none of that.</p>
      <p>"And I believe it's now possible for me to see my, eh, file. Can you help me in this matter?" he added. She ushered him into a little anteroom that to him felt a bit like a headmaster's office and an envelope was laid out on the table. It was one of those special legal envelopes with a metal catch with string round it and he remembered feeling suddenly, irrationally, furious because the metal was rusty.</p>
      <p>An internal flare of anger. For God's sake, this is my stuff in here! Rust? Could they not have put it in a new envelope? See the state of that!</p>
      <p>Like nobody cared. Like he was forgotten. Then he swiftly chided himself. What difference does it make? Let's be honest, it doesn't.</p>
      <p>The woman unravelled the string and laid out the papers. "I'll leave you to it now, you can take some notes." And with that she gave him a pad with a pencil. He decided she was not unkind.</p>
      <p>Most of it was legal bumf, documents giving details about the couple who had adopted him, Jim and Ellen Fisher. He skipped that to begin with. He wanted a name. And what stopped him, pinned him to his seat, in a moment that remains crystal clear with him to this day, was the sight of a single sheet of blue Basildon Bond notepaper. I never liked Basildon Bond. It signifies the worst tightness and conformity of the bloody Scottish aspiring working class, you know - as in 'Basildon Bond, it's got a watermark on it.' And on the blue paper were two short lines, written in fountain pen. It was dated March 1956, and said: "I, William Blake Kerr, do hereby promise to pay the sum of £3 per month towards the keep of Gregor McKenzie in the care of Clackmannanshire County Council until such time as he is adopted." It was signed WB Kerr.</p>
      <p>The writing was deliberate, clear - a well-practised signature. An educated hand, but Gregor got the impression of somebody who was trying very hard to keep it steady. The signature was a big "W", in that oldfashioned way with a flourish, then a big, pregnant "B". Gregor stared at it for a very long time: William Blake Kerr, his father's name.</p>
      <p>But it would only have taken a minute for him to sign that bit of Basildon Bond. To sign away his son.</p>
      <p>He thought about it for a bit more; thought of his own son, Alexander.</p>
      <p>Three pounds a month - that's £1 6s a fortnight. Nine shillings a week. Nine shillings. Not a whole lot more than me and my pals used to spend on crisps and chocolate at the Pavilion on a Saturday. Nine shillings for my keep. For me.</p>
      <p>Gregor turned to the other documents. WB Kerr had been back at his solicitors in November 1956. Here was the official legal document giving his consent for James and Ellen Fisher to adopt Gregor McKenzie: "I, William Blake Kerr, Officer of Customs and Excise, 2 Park Terrace, Tullibody, being the father of said child, hereby state that I understand the nature and effect of the Adoption Order for which application is made and that I understand that the effect of the order will permanently deprive me of my parental rights."</p>
      <p>He had signed it, a larger signature - WB Kerr - with a certain authoritative flourish in the slanting line he drew under the "Kerr".</p>
      <p>It would only have taken a minute to sign that too. To sign away his son. To sign away ... me.</p>
      <p>William Kerr went back to his solicitor one more time, on March 22, 1957, to fill in the blanks on the final document consenting to permanent adoption and giving up his parental rights. This time his writing is a little more crunched, less deliberate, more hurried. "I, William B. Kerr," it begins, but in the space "being the . . . . . . of the child", the space where he should have written "father", he wrote nothing. The word has been added later in the handwriting of the lawyer.</p>
      <p>Was William Kerr in a hurry that day, or simply agitated? Or did he just want the whole embarrassment over and done with, couldn't bear to be dragged back once again? And couldn't bring himself to acknowledge paternity one last time.</p>
      <p>You weren't hanging around that time, WB, were you? Gregor walked out of Hamilton sheriff court into the fresh air. He felt peculiar. It was another of those moments, just as when Cis died. Normal life was going on all round him, but everything had changed - that sense of dislocation again. Didn't people realise what had happened? The world had slipped a bit, shifted, but nobody realised. Now he had proof of who his father was. He knew his name. Knew where he lived and what his job was. But somehow he felt even emptier, and knew even less.</p>
      <p>[Gregor later learns his father was almost twice the age of his mother, and had a wife and family at home. He never learns how his mother and father met but there was surprising evidence of a genuine love affair. His research leads him to discover other blood relatives, including a half-brother, John. Their father W. B. Kerr died in 1965.] ong! Pause. Bong! Pause. Bong!</p>
      <p>BUpstairs in his old farmhouse in the southwest of France, the noise stirs Gregor Fisher half-awake. Outside, the barn owls are calling and he can hear the frogs in the nearby stream. It's about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
      <p>Bloody clock, he thinks. And pulls up the duvet, hoping it will shut up and he can get back to sleep.</p>
      <p>Bong! With a curse, he rolls out of bed, trying not to wake Vicki, and then, stark naked, pads downstairs to the living room where the old mantelpiece clock sits, silent now, smug. The clock that keeps no time and is not wound up, but every so often comes to life and starts chiming.</p>
      <p>"You effing thing", he tells it, but very affectionately. Picking it up gently, he tilts it to stop it chiming anymore.</p>
      <p>Then goes back upstairs to bed, reflecting on the strange and unknowable things in life.</p>
      <p>It's WB Kerr's clock, you see. William Kerr, the father he never knew. When his half-brother John died, the Kerr family wanted to pass on to Gregor some of the old man's possessions.</p>
      <p>One was a dark wood mantelpiece clock presented to the young officer when he left the Belfast Customs &amp; Excise station in 1928 and transferred to Clackmannanshire. His name and the dates were engraved on the back.</p>
      <p>And that clock, that effing clock ... I have to say, I'm sure people will think I make these things up, but at any time of the day or night that clock could spring into action. You try and ignore it and then, bong, it's off again and you think, 'Oh, God, come on! Give me a break, WBK'</p>
      <p>'They chose to meet outside the lost property office. Well, every station has one, doesn't it? The pathos of it completely escaped them'</p>
      <p>'On the blue paper were two short lines in fountain pen. 'I, William Blake Kerr do hereby promise to pay the sum of £3 per month towards the keep of Gregor McKenzie''</p>
      <p>Gregor Fisher, aged about four, with Cis, right, and his sisters Una, centre, and Margaret. The marriage of his adoptive parents Ellen Sellars and Jim Fisher, said to bear a likeliness to Gregor. Above, Fisher's mother, Catherine McKenzie, alongside a young Gregor in his first year at primary school, and his full sister Maureen William Blake Kerr, pictured here in the 1920s signed away his parental rights to Gregor Fisher, forgetting to fill in a space on the adoption form which should have read "father"</p>

      <title>The aroma of fresh prawns on a hot barbecue transports us city dwellers to holidays by the sea</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>There are few things better in life than eating freshly grilled seafood with your fingers on a warm, sandy beach. For most of us city dwellers, the smoky aroma of fresh prawns on a hot barbecue is enough to transport us to relaxing holidays by the sea.</p>
      <p>But before you fire up the barbecue, here are a few tips on grilling fish.</p>
      <p>The first thing to remember is that seafood requires less marinating time than meat.Twenty minutes is plenty for the flavours to infuse. Any longer and the acids in the marinade (in the form of citrus juice or vinegar) will "cook" the fish.</p>
      <p>The barbecue itself should be clean and oiled. A long-handled metal brush is ideal for cleaning the grills, but I prefer to use a scrunched-up piece of foil to sweep along the grates. Wipe off any remaining dirt with an oiled piece of kitchen paper. (It's much easier to remove burnt food from the grill while it is still hot, so make it a habit to clean the barbecue each time after cooking, using a pair of long-handled tongs to avoid burning your hands.) Light the barbecue 15 to 20 minutes before you start to cook. The fire will eventually die down, leaving hot red coals covered more than two-thirds by white ash, which is when you should add the food. Delicate fillets of white fish can be placed on a piece of foil to prevent them breaking up but firm fish like mackerel and monkfish should not stick to the cooking grate if well oiled and cooked for just the right amount of time. Try not to turn any fish more than once. If it sticks, leave it to cook for another minute or two and it should be easier to turn.</p>
      <p>Cooking times depend on the size of the fish and the heat of the barbecue so the timings I give here are only guidelines. Take the prawns off the barbecue just as they turn orangey-red and opaque -they'll continue cooking with the residual heat. For a whole fish or thicker fillets, insert a knife between the layers of the flesh and turn it slightly to look inside. If the fish is still translucent in the centre, give it a minute or two more.</p>
      <p>Salt and Garlic Prawn</p>
      <p>Skewers with Sweet Chilli Dipping Sauce</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>Keeping the prawns in their shells makes grilling much easier as the shells prevent the flesh from sticking to the grill. You will need 4-5 skewers for the prawns, preferably metal ones which conduct heat and will help to cook the prawns from the inside. If you want to be fancy you can use lemon-grass stalks as skewers, but do remember to soak them for at least an hour beforehand or they'll scorch very quickly.</p>
      <p>16-20 king prawns, shell on</p>
      <p>Olive oil, to drizzle</p>
      <p>3 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced</p>
      <p>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
      <p>For the dressing</p>
      <p>6 tbsp sweet chilli sauce</p>
      <p>1 tsp grated ginger</p>
      <p>1 small red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped Juice of 1 large lime</p>
      <p>11/2 tbsp fish sauce</p>
      <p>Handful of mint and coriander, leaves chopped</p>
      <p>1 Preheat the barbecue or grill. With a pair of kitchen scissors, cut along the back shell of the prawns to remove and discard the dark vein. I prefer to keep the heads on but you could choose to remove them.</p>
      <p>2 Thread 4-5 prawns on to skewers. Place in a single layer on a large dish or baking tray. Drizzle over the olive oil, then scatter over the sliced garlic, salt and pepper.</p>
      <p>3 Mix together all the ingredients for the dressing and divide among four small dipping bowls.</p>
      <p>4 Cook the prawns on the barbecue until they turn red and opaque, turning over once. Serve immediately, with the dipping sauce on the side.</p>
      <p>Griddled Tuna Steaks with Coriander and Grilled Corn Salsa</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>Ask your fishmonger for thick slices of tuna as you don't want them to overcook. Well-done tuna is a complete waste of good-quality fish -always aim to get it rare or medium rare if you can. If you don't like tuna, fresh salmon steaks would work equally well with the marinade and grilled corn salsa.</p>
      <p>4x 3cm thick tuna steaks (about 250g each)</p>
      <p>2 tbsp coriander seeds</p>
      <p>2 tbsp black peppercorns</p>
      <p>Sea salt</p>
      <p>2 tbsp sesame oil</p>
      <p>2 tbsp groundnut oil</p>
      <p>Small handful of coriander, chopped</p>
      <p>2 limes, cut into wedges to garnish</p>
      <p>For the salsa</p>
      <p>2 medium corn on the cob, trimmed</p>
      <p>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra</p>
      <p>for drizzling</p>
      <p>2 red peppers</p>
      <p>2 spring onions, trimmed and chopped</p>
      <p>1 red chilli, trimmed, deseeded and finely chopped</p>
      <p>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
      <p>Juice of half a lime</p>
      <p>Handful of coriander leaves, roughly chopped</p>
      <p>1 Pat the tuna steaks dry with kitchen paper and place in a wide bowl.</p>
      <p>Lightly toast the coriander seeds and peppercorns in a small, dry pan. Tip into a pestle and mortar and coarsely crush with a little pinch of salt.</p>
      <p>Mix in the oils and chopped coriander, then rub over the fish steaks. Cover with clingfilm and leave to marinate for about 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>2 Meanwhile, heat up the barbecue or grill. Brush the corn with a little olive oil and place on the hot grills with a pair of tongs. Turn over occasionally and cook for about 15 minutes until tender and browned on the sides. Place the red peppers alongside the corn and grill until the skins are blistered and charred all over, turning occasionally. Remove the peppers to a bowl and cover with clingfilm. Leave to cool for 5-10 minutes.</p>
      <p>3 When cooked, carefully remove the corn and allow to cool slightly. Using a sharp knife, slice along the cob to remove the kernels, then place in a large bowl. Peel off the blackened skins from the peppers and remove the seeds. Roughly dice the flesh and add to the corn along with the chopped spring onions and chilli. Season with salt and pepper and toss with the lime juice and olive oil. Right before serving, stir through the chopped coriander.</p>
      <p>4 Transfer the tuna steaks on to the barbecue and cook for about 2-21/2 minutes each side until browned. It should be medium rare in the centre.</p>
      <p>Rest the steaks for a couple of minutes and serve with sweetcorn salsa and a wedge of lime.</p>
      <p>Barbecued Whole Mackerel</p>
      <p>Serves 4</p>
      <p>Mackerel spoils quickly and you should really cook them on the day of purchase, or if you're lucky enough to live by the sea, freshly caught. It is much easier to grill a whole fish on the bone, rather than filleted, but you do need to score the thick flesh to ensure even cooking. Oily fish always go well with robust herbs such as rosemary, which is what I'm using here.</p>
      <p>4 whole mackerel, gutted</p>
      <p>Handful of rosemary sprigs</p>
      <p>1 head of garlic</p>
      <p>Rosemary-infused olive oil, to drizzle</p>
      <p>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
      <p>2 lemons, halved</p>
      <p>1 Preheat the barbecue or grill. Wash the mackerel well and dry both the inside and outside of the fish with kitchen paper. Score the skin of each fish with a few diagonal slashes on both sides and stud the cavities with rosemary sprigs.</p>
      <p>2 Break the garlic into individual cloves and push the cloves through four long sprigs of rosemary. Stick a sprig inside each fish and season all over with salt and pepper and a generous drizzle of rosemary-infused oil.</p>
      <p>3 Lay the fish on top of the hot barbecue or grill and cook for about 5 minutes until the flesh is firm and opaque. Carefully turn over the fish and grill for another 4-5 minutes until cooked through. (Don't worry if a few rosemary leaves fall into the hot ambers -they will provide an aromatic smokiness to the fish.) Add the lemon halves to the barbecue, cut side down, for a couple of minutes until lightly caramelised.</p>
      <p>4 Serve each fish with a caramelised lemon half and a drizzle more of rosemary oil.</p>

      <subtitle>The Queen struck a chord in referring to the diversity of national life</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Change is a constant, and managing it is an expanding discipline. That paradoxical observation was made by the Queen when she addressed parliament in her golden jubilee year of 2002. It may have been in her mind when she made her traditional Christmas address to the nation, broadcast yesterday, in which she made extensive reference to the diversity of British society.</p>
      <p>It was a novel theme compared with previous Christmas broadcasts, and it was aptly chosen. Britain has changed markedly in the 68 years of the Queen's reign. Among the reasons that she commands popular respect, even in an age when habits of deference have long since been eclipsed, is that she is attuned to the way Britain and the Commonwealth are in reality rather than in myth. That awareness helps to bind the nation amid the adversity wreaked by the global pandemic.</p>
      <p>In her remarks, the Queen noted that Britain's faith communities had been unable this year to celebrate festivals and high holy days as they would have wished. She referred to the spectacle of fireworks lighting up the sky around Windsor last month as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated</p>
      <p>Diwali, the Festival of Lights, while scrupulously practising social distancing. She mentioned Mary Seacole, a Crimean War aid worker of Jamaican origin, alongside Florence Nightingale as a pioneer of nursing. And, citing the parable of the Good Samaritan, she referred to the outpouring of selfless service in modern Britain, "regardless of gender, race or background".</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Queen's words were prompted in part by controversy concerning the role of the Duchess of Sussex. It is possible to cavil about Seacole's relative significance in medical history. Yet these speculations are beside the point that the impulse of simple humanitarianism in crisis is to be honoured, and it has been practised by Britons of all backgrounds. That's what the nation is like.</p>
      <p>A constitutional monarchy is only as strong as the regard in which it is held. This in turn requires the monarch to have a strong sense of duty. It has not always been thus. When George IV died in 1830 a Times leader, noting his notorious profligacy, averred that "there never was an individual less regretted by his fellow creatures than this deceased king". The prospect of a monarch more preoccupied with gilded hedonism than public service dogged the reputation of Edward VII in his decades as heir to the throne. It has afflicted the Queen's second son to this day.</p>
      <p>In a democratic age the monarch might have been regarded as an anachronism. Yet the Queen has exercised her ceremonial role with unfailing dignity. The immense social shifts of her reign have only once wrongfooted her, when her natural reserve seemed to many inappropriate after the death of Princess Diana in 1997. Yet she swiftly acknowledged public feeling and has invariably called correctly the balance between approachability and decorum. She even managed to pull off a fine joke by pretending to parachute into the Olympic Stadium alongside James Bond in 2012.</p>
      <p>Those Games are fondly recalled as showing Britain at its most generous and welcoming, and for the ethnic diversity of its athletes. In a year of immense hardship the Queen's message has emphasised the cohesion of British society. It is not a mere platitude but a source of wisdom and encouragement, reinforced by the knowledge that she has seen much in her long reign.</p>

      <p>Citizen McCain faces his High Noon in California.</p>
      <p>It is fitting that the struggle for the Republican presidential nomination should reach a climax in Los Angeles, the celluloid city, for this has been an epic, full Technicolor, Dolby-stereo primary season.</p>
      <p>California is just one of more than a dozen states going to the polls on "Super Tuesday" next week, but the result in the West Coast primary will almost certainly seal the fate of John McCain's remarkable bid to wrestle the nomination from George W. Bush. On Thursday the two rivals clashed testily in a last debate, held just a tantrum's throw from Hollywood at the Los Angeles Times building, and set the stage for the</p>
      <p>final scene.</p>
      <p>McCain's Mutiny on the Bounty has not been crushed yet. He may yet win the popular vote in California, if not the state's vast clutch of delegates, and thus continue to argue that he is the most electable candidate in November. But more likely California will be the setting for a Braveheart defeat, when McCain finally succumbs to overwhelming odds and is then put on the rack by the Republican Party.</p>
      <p>Like all the best movie spectaculars, this one has been action-packed, rousing and thoroughly unpredictable, with actors who have consistently declined to stick to the script laid out by the pundits and pollsters. It was billed as The Sound of Music primary race, with some familiar tunes known to all and a rousing foregone finale.</p>
      <p>Instead it turned into Rocky, with the challenger slugging the champion to the mat in one round, only to be flattened by his opponent in the next. Whenever the bell seemed about to ring, the downed man staggered bloodily back on to his feet.</p>
      <p>From New Hampshire to Virginia, every fresh reel offered a new plot twist. McCain was supposed to take an early bow, but instead he filched, if briefly, the leading role. Bush's multimillion-dollar production was expected to sweep the box office, but instead he has spent almost</p>
      <p>all his money fighting off a low-budget, B-movie tale about war, guts and "gooks", cobbled together on a shoestring.</p>
      <p>Bush was supposed to triumph as the Leonardo DiCaprio of Republicanism, but instead he has been crammed into an uncomfortable role on the right of the party, tarred as a creature of the evangelical lobby, an old-style conservative and even an anti-Catholic bigot. None of this is deserved, but Bush will spend the months between now and November struggling to shed such damaging type-casting.</p>
      <p>There was even a time when it seemed that Bush might one day invite McCain to co-star with him as a running-mate. If they met today, after another long Hollywood tradition, they would probably throw drinks at each other and start clawing.</p>
      <p>McCain has risen swiftly to astonishing heights, and he may be brought down not by fate but by his own flaws; an idealist betrayed by his own temperament and ambition. He may be Citizen McCain.</p>
      <p>The defining, perhaps fatal moment of his campaign came when the Senator ascended a Virginia stage and denounced leaders of the Christian Right, those pillars of the Republican establishment, as manipulative bigots, with Bush in their pocket. It was a hugely audacious gamble, which may win him moderate Republican votes in New York and California while surely destroying any hope he had of winning in the South.</p>
      <p>But McCain went too far. The righteous anger that is his greatest strength and signal weakness bubbled over when he called the Reverends Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson "the forces of evil". Even those who share his views of the Religious Right began wondering why he was suddenly speaking their apocalyptic language. McCain's temper let him down, and for the first time he looked like a rebel without a cause.</p>
      <p>McCain's supporters may cite a High Noon moment, a stand made for principle rather than self-preservation; his detractors might refer to The Caine Mutiny, the story of a brave naval officer who begins to crack up and endangers his ship.</p>
      <p>It's not over until the credits roll, and a once-straight race that has revealed more unexpected kinks than Hugh Grant on Sunset Boulevard may surprise us yet. But if, as polls predict, McCain wins in the New England states on Tuesday yet fails to make a breakthrough in New York, Ohio and above all California, then his moment in the limelight must be over, after a performance that not only upstaged his Republican rivals but relegated</p>
      <p>the Democratic race to a sideshow.</p>
      <p>Bush, who came with ranks of supporters and glowing reviews, now seems set to take the trophy. Indeed, his closing remarks on Thursday night had an oddly Oscarish ring: "I'd like to thank my friends here in California, my mother . . ." Yet he has been impoverished, bruised and toughened by his tangle with McCain. The Arizona Senator has ensured that there will be a sequel, to be released in the autumn, more gripping than anyone could have predicted.</p>
      <p>The Texas Governor once expected to waltz into the White House, but no longer. The prospective race with Al Gore has tightened dramatically and Bush, if he finally emerges with the nomination, will have to reunite a fractured party, restock his coffers and reclaim the centre ground. He badly underestimated his Republican rival; he will not make the same mistake about Gore. Take your seats for Clash of the Titans.</p>

    <text>
      <p>NOW that the Scottish Premier League is looking for a new sponsor, it could do a lot worse than to get Berlitz to replace the Bank of Scotland. What better for a league that has a multi-national workforce than a company that could hand out free booklets around the dressing-rooms of the Premierleague demanding the abolition of diving?</p>
      <p>Berlitz would not need to use up all of its 30 languages, but its specialist skills would be required. Including one in Scots. Diving has suddenly become the hot topic in the Premierleague after the public outcry about Heart of Midlothian's recent affliction to the disease.</p>
      <p>Rudi Skacel was the subject of so much scorn from the Falkirk players last Saturday after his dreadful playacting -perhaps he was playing charades? ("it's a film, two words, second one sounds like clown; that's it, Falling Down) -that the club's management team are to have a word with the Czech Republic player about his future behaviour.</p>
      <p>"Rudi has been a massive part of what we've done so far but we know there's a wee bit of baggage that comes with him that might need to be addressed," John McGlynn, the assistant coach, who is now joint caretaker with Valdas Ivanauskas after the sacking of Graham Rix, said. "It's up to Valdas what he says but it's maybe the right thing to do."</p>
      <p>Skacel is not the first Hearts player to get into trouble for diving. His compatriot, Roman Bednar, was sent off in the Tennent's Scotttish Cup quarter-final against Partick Thistle -he misses this weekend's semi-final against Hibernian as a result -for diving as he rounded Kenny Arthur, the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Edgaras Jankauskas was sent off in a derby at Easter Road for collecting two yellows, one of which was for diving. Deveidas Cesnauskis, another Lithuania international, was also booked at Dunfermline Athletic earlier in the season for the same crime.</p>
      <p>Now, before Tynecastle fans begin to roar about their team being the victims of a media campaign, it has to be said that this is an issue that been simmering all season and has only now boiled over because it has become such a frequent backdrop to Hearts games.</p>
      <p>Jankauskas, Cesnauskas and Mikoliunas are the three worst offenders but the Czech pair have come to the fore recently. Worse than that, it has spread to Scottish players, too.</p>
      <p>Steven Pressley sparked outrage at Dundee United when his dive won a late penalty.</p>
      <p>Andy Webster has recently incorporated this into his game, part of the trend of diving defenders -more of which later -who go down on cue in their own box to win a foul and alleviate pressure. The Scotland centre-back feigned injury against John Hartson when television clearly showed there was no contact, but hitting the deck against mighty Partick Thistle of the second division in the recent cup tie took the new philosophy to extremes. "It's a preconception that foreign players come here and dive about all over the place. That is something that goes on in all games," Craig Gordon, the Hearts and Scotland goalkeeper said yesterday, as he defended Skacel. "To say it's just a foreign thing, I don't think that's true."</p>
      <p>Too true, Craig. The Times conducted a vigorous antidiving campaign in the Barclays Premiership two months ago, with "No To Diving" posters being put up in several languages at various clubs.</p>
      <p>The SPL would not just need Czech and Lithuanian but also Greek, Japanese, Danish and even Aussie. It would also need one in its native tongue -what about "Gonnae naw dae that!" -to cater for the local miscreants.</p>
      <p>Skacel was not the only one diving last Saturday. A quick look at the Premierleague highlights saw Barry Wilson con a penalty against Hibernian at Easter Road. The Inverness Caledonian Thistle forward was so adept at making it look as if he was brought down by Gary Caldwell, but the trick is to look at the forward's feet -if they go together before take off, he's dived; no one who is tripped unwittingly ever goes down so cleanly.</p>
      <p>The old line about there "being contact" is as out of date as Mitre Mouldmasters. The game has come a long way. Players are now as capable of engineering that contact by falling at the right moment or sticking a leg out to brush the defender they are going past.</p>
      <p>Twenty years ago, players who could curl the ball over a wall were few and far between; now everyone can and the same applies to simulation.</p>
      <p>If Scotland can stamp out smoking, surely it can do the same to diving. It's time to name and shame some of the worst offenders in the Premierleague: in no particular order, step forward -and, please, don't fall when you do so -Scott McDonald, Peter Lovenkrands, Barry Robson, Edgaras Jankaukas (with nominations to Skacel, Webster, Bednar and Cesnauskas as best supporting actors), Shunsuke Nakamura and Sotirios Kyrgiakos.</p>
      <p>McDonald takes a lot of rough treatment leading the line for Motherwell, but the fiesty little Australian also hands it out -he got away with a barge in Gary Caldwell's back in the lead-up to a goal against Hibernian two weeks ago that a larger man would have been punished for. McDonald favours the sniper method, going down when brushed from behind.</p>
      <p>Lovenkrands is currently a man on a roll, in terms of his goalscoring, but the Rangers winger is another who cannot stay on his feet when he goes past defenders.</p>
      <p>His reputation as an actor goes back to that Old Firm derby last season when he got Alan Thompson sent off for a headbutt that was more Glasgow Miss than Glasgow Kiss.</p>
      <p>Barry Robson, of Dundee United, is a gifted dead-ball specialist, one of the best in the Premierleague. Unfortunately, he wins most of the free kicks himself in and around the box. For an endorsement, you have to only look to his peers -Robson was condemned by his former Inverness team-mates on the final day of last season as he collapsed to win the penalty that ensured United's survival. He was surrounded by an angry Highland mob that made Braveheart look tame.</p>
      <p>Jankauskas, we've dealt with. Suffice to say that his time at FC Porto saw him learn the black arts under Jose Mournho. The Times has been on his case ever since his dive for Lithuania in Kaunas from a non-existent tackle from Jackie McNamara cost Scotland three points in the Euro 2004 qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>Shunsuke Nakamura is one those strange cases who are both victim and offender.</p>
      <p>Celtic's elfin playmaker looked out of his depth, physically, when he first came to the Premierleague and there is no doubt, as Gordon Strachan continually points out, that the Japan player takes a bruising amount of sly kicks to his slender frame. However, he also drops far too easily and perhaps Stilian Petrov -a rehabilitated offender who has cast aside the bad ways he grew up with in Bulgaria -should have a word in Nakamura's ear.</p>
      <p>Last, but not least, Kyrgiakos. The man who crashes to the floor quicker than plates at a Greek wedding, is the Premierleague's most addicted diver. The Rangers defender will dive anywhere on the pitch -one of his three dismissals this term, at Dundee United, included the habitual yellow for diving -but it is the former Panathinaikos player's persistent use of the new curse, diving while in possession of the ball and running towards your own goal, usually with a forward just behind, that is the most irritating.</p>
      <p>Alex McLeish had to tell one of Kyrgiakos's former Ibrox colleagues, Gregory Vignal, to stop diving last season. One can only assume the long-haired Greek did not listen in this season. His repetitive simulation has become tiresome. If Roberto Baggio was the Divine Ponytail who embodied the beautiful game, it is Kyrgiakos, the Diving Ponytail, who is helping to scar its face.</p>
      <p>Correction</p>
      <p>MISTAKEN IDENTITY IN AN ARTICLE entitled "Named and shamed: the divers who blight football in Scotland" in yesterday's Times, we made reference to the fact that Edgaras Jankauskas, the Heart of Midlothian forward, was involved in a diving incident in the Lithuania v Scotland game in April 2003. That fact was incorrect: the Lithuania player who went down to gain the penalty on that occasion was Darius Macielivcius. Jankauskas had been substituted 11 minutes earlier and The Times is glad to correct this case of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>However, contrary to some claims, Jankauskas has been booked this season for diving while playing for Hearts. The Scottish Football Association has confirmed that he was cautioned at Falkirk on October 11 for simulation. He was also sent off against Hibernian later that month for two yellow cards, the first of which was issued in 44 minutes for "persistent infringement of the laws of the game". This is a catch-all category, not necessarily for the last foul for which it was obtained, ie: persistent.</p>
      <p>In Jankauskas's case, this included simulation and dissent as the Times match report of October 31 referred to: "The former FC Porto striker dived so frequently in the first half that he tried the patience of John Underhill before the referee booked him for persistent fouling. When Scott Brown later came in from behind and clipped him, Jankauskas went theatrically into the air. Underhill awarded Hearts the free kick, but as he did so, the Lithuanian retaliated with an angry two-handed shove on his marker. Underhill was left with no alternative but to issue a red card for violent conduct."</p>
      <p>Two other Hearts players have been cautioned for simulation this season. Rudi Skacel at Motherwell on November 26 and Roman Bednar against Partick Thistle in the Tennent's Scottish Cup last month, for which he received a second yellow card.</p>

Rooms are bright with high ceilings and chic furnishings, and there's a café-bar with a modern take on retro styling.

      <title>The Mexican revolutionary who's conquering Hollywood</title>
      <subtitle>Gael García Bernal's acclaimed film about the toppling of Pinochet is up for an Oscar. Rhys Blakely meets him</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It seems fair to assume that Gael García Bernal shares an affinity with revolutionaries and agitators.</p>
      <p>The Mexican actor has played Che Guevara twice and has named his baby daughter Libertad - "Freedom" in Spanish. He's producing a film on the iconic Chicano labour rights activist César Chávez. In 2003 he denounced the Iraq war on stage at the Oscars and a decade before that he marched in support of Mexico's Zapatistas, a band of leftist rebels who had declared war on the government.</p>
      <p>In Hollywood terms, he's an unusually political pin-up. "In Latin America, politics is very present in everyday life," he shrugs. "It's not like in other parts of the world, where participation in politics is like playing tennis - where you do it and then go back to your everyday life."</p>
      <p>We meet in Los Angeles, in a bland conference room at his publicists' headquarters where Bernal is surrounded by the trappings of celebrity: the snapper who's just photographed him for The Times; the grooming team drafted into ensure he looks his best (as if he wouldn't have looked like a million dollars if he'd just rolled out of bed); the aide delivering his espresso.</p>
      <p>And yet, despite the entourage, he carries himself like an interloper. He may have the matinee-idol looks, the millionwatt smile and the retinue, but when he refers to LA, he calls it "this place" with the most minuscule hint of a sneer - just enough to distance himself from what others have called "the bogus hustle of the movie business".</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he is here to hustle: to promote his latest project, No, a critically fêted period piece by the Chilean director Pablo Larraín. This month it became the first work from Chile to be nominated for best foreign film at the Oscars. But viewed through the lens of Hollywood it is an oddity - cerebral, complicated, weirdly funny - and Bernal is delighted with it. "I usually have a kind of critical barrier that never allows me to fully say I love something that I did," he says. "With No, it's not there."</p>
      <p>Set in 1988, the film tells the true story of how the Chilean dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, sure of his control of the country, allowed Chileans to vote on the future of his regime. Bernal plays René Saavedra, a young, advertising hotshot and recently returned exile, who is persuaded to work for the leftist anti-Pinochet "No" campaign. While his colleagues fear that Pinochet will rig the voting, Saavedra (an amalgam of two men who worked on the No campaign's daily television adverts) sets about hawking the prospect of political transformation. Using television jingles and snappy branding, he sells the promise of an end to years of political murders and abductions and intimidation as if he were launching a new fizzy drink.</p>
      <p>The film is strident in its criticism of Pinochet, painting a chilling picture of a thuggish regime - a characterisation that Bernal is clearly comfortable with. Several members of the actual "No" campaign appear on screen, but none of the pro-Pinochet "Yes" movement would participate.</p>
      <p>"They were in hand with a dictator," he says. "Nobody wants to show that."</p>
      <p>Shot using rebuilt U-matic video cameras from the 1980s, one critic has described No as "an ugly looking movie - literally - for an ugly time". That may be true, but it misses the point. The blurry tones and the obscuring lens flare allow the acted scenes to meld with the archive footage taken from the real "No" television ads. The result is anti-Hollywood; a beguiling anomaly of a movie with a guerilla vibe. As Bernal puts it, just as "the whole world is turning to 3-D ... the best way to watch No is on video".</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the defeat of the villainous Pinochet is peaceful but disquieting. Saavedra, the skateboard-riding hero of the piece, succeeds because he "sells a political ideology as if it's macaroni cheese", says Bernal. A lost soul, Saavedra prefigures the superficial, money-driven political campaigns we live with today. His advertising genius clinches a stunning victory for the good guys, but at what cost and to what end? At the movie's close, you're not sure. "The director said we are going to create a discussion; we are going to create a problem," says Bernal. "And we are going to leave the audience dealing with it."</p>
      <p>If that makes No an intriguing film, then Bernal - in Hollywood terms, at least - is a curious actor. His greatest roles include a Marxist revolutionary and a homicidal transvestite, but in person he's an unassuming blend of bloke and geek. Famously, he's only 5ft 7in (it hasn't stopped him being called the "Mexican Brad Pit) and when we meet he's dressed in a T-shirt and jeans. His manner is just as casual: he describes films he's recently seen and admired as "wonderful, f****n' fantasteek movies!" (He's full of praise for No's Oscar rival Amour). He raves about Tottenham Hotspur -- and "the Premiership, the best league in the world". His English is ambitious but imperfect; when he can't find the right word he has an endearing habit of cursing his way through.</p>
      <p>He has been, he says, phenomenally lucky. The son of two theatre actors, he appeared in Mexican soap operas in his early teens. This, however, was only "play acting".</p>
      <p>The serious stuff would come later and in the late 1990s, he was a teenager at a loose end in London. The university in Mexico where he begun to study philosophy had been shut by a strike; "London was the cheapest air fare to Europe". He crashed on floors, worked on building sites, fixed cocktails at an Islington bar by night and pondered studying drama.</p>
      <p>The break came in 2000, when the director Alejandro González Iñárritu pulled him out of London's Central School of Speech and Drama, mid-term, to star as a feral tearaway in Amores Perros, three stories of love, death and betrayal in Mexico City. He went on to star in a trio of critical hits: Alfonso Cuarón's Y Tu Mamá También, Pedro Almódovar's Bad Education, and Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries. Not only did they make him a cult star (the swooning British press anointed him "a mythical actor" on the back of them) but they also fuelled a renaissance in Latin American cinema.</p>
      <p>In the years that followed, he wore his leftist, progressive political leanings on his sleeve and revealed himself as an actor who would fret about his work. In 2005, he appeared on stage in Lorca's Blood Wedding, at the Almeida in Islington. He played a man driven by sexual obsession - "more an emotion than a character" said one critic. Bernal worried whether he could cut it in theatre - "am I going to have that complexity? That intensity?" (I saw a performance; he was good, but perhaps slightly overwhelmed by the devilishly tricky play).</p>
      <p>Nowadays, he speaks fondly of his years in London, "a place that belongs to me, like I belong to it". That's great, I reply - but hasn't he blasted British films for "their total absence of spontaneous form", dismissing them as vehicles for a "stale identity that you [Britons] sell abroad and buy into yourselves"? He flashes the million-watt smile. The problem, he answers in his broken English, is that we Brits revere our institutions too much. Political films such as the The Queen seemed cowed by the heft of Parliament and the monarchy. If he were British, he suggests that he'd intimately dissect one relatively small event - perhaps something like Robin Cook's resignation speech against the Iraq war in 2003. Bernal, it seems, is fascinated by political debate. "Elections are, in a funny way, very undemocratic," he ventures. "The choice in an election is black and white, while life is grey, is debate - no?" Now that he is 34, he has a few white hairs and two young children with his wife, the Argentine actress Dolores Fonzi. He's just begun to feel his age, he claims. Making No was the first time that he has worked with a director - the 36-year-old Larraín - of his own generation. He adds that fatherhood has brought "a strange sense of freedom - before I was worried about too much bulls***". One product of all of this, it appears, may be a new openness to taking on a big Hollywood film.</p>
      <p>In the past he pitied "those [Hollywood] actors, with their difficult lives, expensive lives." Now, by contrast, he's happy to be linked with a new big-budget reboot of Zorro, rumoured to be under development at Twentieth Century Fox. "Before I used to want to focus on doing films in South America, because that's where I can fly most, in a way," he tells me. "Now I can say it would be fun to do something like Zorro."</p>
      <p>In his earliest pulp magazine incarnation in 1919, the Zorro character strived "to avenge the helpless, to punish cruel politicians, to aid the oppressed". It feels like a role that Bernal, with his Zapatista sympathies, might make his own - even if it seems slightly odd for him to be following in the footsteps of Douglas Fairbanks and Antonio Banderas.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the real test will be whether he can make a big Hollywood action movie that pleases him as much as No, a project that he says has "recovered a little bit of happiness in me for cinema". The odds would seem to be against it. But Zorro famously wears a black cape to disguise his identity - so let's see if Bernal can use him to traffic a little rebellion into Hollywood. No is released on February 8</p>
      <p>'A dramatic chameleon': Bernal's roles Amores Perros</p>
      <p>Alejandro González Iñárritu, 2000 A brilliant, brutal film that kick-started Mexico's cinematic renaissance, as well as Bernal's movie career. He plays the naive Octavio whose desire to win the heart of his sister-in-law leads him into the vicious underworld of high-stake dog fights.</p>
      <p>The Motorcycle Diaries Walter Salles, 2004 For the second time, after the TV mini-series Fidel, Bernal plays Che Guevara - this time as a student who, along with his sidekick, finds himself (and the whole of Latin America) while riding around on the back of a spluttery Norton 500 motorbike.</p>
      <p>Y Tu Mamá También (And Your Mother Too) Alfonso Cuarón, 2002 A coming-of-age tale of two teenage boys who hit the road in search of chicks and dope only to return shell-shocked by their sexuality-bending adventures. Made on a shoestring, the film grossed $17 million in three weeks.</p>
      <p>The Science of Sleep Michel Gondry, 2006 The French arch-surrealist behind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind casts Bernal - vulnerable and doe-eyed - opposite Charlotte Gainsbourg as an artist who has difficulty separating dreams - does he really have giant hands? - from reality.</p>
      <p>Bad Education Pedro Almodóvar, 2004 An intoxicating noir melodrama from the Spanish auteur Almodóvar. The New York Times described Bernal - as a young man masquerading as his dead brother playing a transsexual in a film drawing on his own warped past - as "a transcendent dramatic chameleon".</p>
      <p>'In Latin America, politics is part of everyday life. In other places it's like playing tennis'</p>
      <p>'This film has recovered a little bit of happiness in me for cinema'</p>
      <p>forward march Gael García Bernal above, in LA, and right, in No, as an advertising hotshot who helps to end Pinochet's dictatorship</p>

      <title>'I'm on a megayacht - and I have no idea how to behave'</title>
      <subtitle>Sathnam Sanghera Joins the billionaires for the Monaco Yacht Show, only to find himself completely out of his depth at every diamond-encrusted turn</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The good news is that I am on a megayacht. Physically on board an actual megayacht in Monaco! And it is ... mega. About 73m long, its five decks are being continually cleaned by a team of sunburnt teenagers with provincial British accents. The ceilings of its 12 guest rooms, seven "state rooms", four double cabins and two twin cabins are lined with precious palladium leaf. The thick panels of sycamore that comprise part of the floor have been sandblasted, bleached and polished to such perfection that they feel like carpet to walk on and the corridor walls appear to be lined with leather, making you feel as if you are padding through a giant luxe handbag.</p>
      <p>The bad news is that, coming from Wolverhampton, where the nearest thing to a body of water is a canal, and only just able to swim, I have no idea of how to behave on a megayacht. So while there turns out to be an informal dress code among the select group of people being shown around - the men in chinos with a pastel pullover draped around their shoulders, the women all looking like a version of Princess Stéphanie of Monaco - my cords and lumberjack shirt don't really cut the mustard. Having no idea you had to take your shoes off before getting on board, I am 15 minutes into the tour before I realise that my socks have holes in them. And everything I say is wrong, whether it is asking the price of the yacht ("If you need to ask, you can't afford it," says someone in our group), inquiring about the identity of the owner of the yacht ("That is confidential information," announces a representative of the Italian manufacturer), or trying to determine whether this boat classes as a superyacht, megayacht or gigayacht. "If you want to be elegant, you say it is a 'large yacht'," says one of the party. "Or a 'very large yacht'."</p>
      <p>Who made the mistake of letting me on? Well, I am at the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show, at the invitation of Boat International (BI) magazine, the Vogue of the superyachting world, to work out why sales are soaring. According to a survey by the industry association Superyacht UK, the British sector is seeing a return to order levels not seen since before the financial crash. BI magazine - so thick with high-end advertising and features on £112,500 Richard Mille watches that the postman fails to get it through my letterbox - estimates that, in terms of length, 9,337m of superyachts were sold across the globe in the calendar year to July 2014, up from 6,716m last year, amounting to sales worth some (EURO)1.99 billion (£1.6 billion), up from (EURO)1.39 billion.</p>
      <p>Of course, having read in the newspaper cuttings, during my easyJet flight, about the Emir of Abu Dhabi's 180m-long yacht Azzam, which at $627 million (£389 million) is classed at the most expensive luxury asset of all time, and Roman Abramovich's 163m Eclipse, which caters for 36 guests, requires 92 crew, includes use of a submarine and costs more than $2 million a week to charter, and how even smaller yachts, as a rule of thumb cost $1 million a metre to build or buy, I have put the boom down to a mindless need to keep up with the Joneses among the globally hyperwealthy. And I can't say my 36 hours in Monaco entirely subvert these preconceptions, given (a) some of the yachts parked in the harbour go by names such as My Trust Fund and Privilege One, (b) I find myself at one point listening to someone complain that the font on the monogrammed towels on a superyacht doesn't quite match "the design philosophy of the boat" (which forces me to redefine the entire notion of first-world problems), and (c) the esoteric nature of the goods flogged to superyacht owners in the miles of exhibition stands.</p>
      <p>They include: a glass company selling a (EURO)90,000 clock; a business flogging boat name signs that cost up to $70,000 each ("They are waterproof," says the sales assistant, as if this is some kind of justification); a Dutch party organiser who tells me it is not uncommon for owners to spend £200,000 on one party just for 100 people, 50 of whom the owner might not even know ("I'm not a pimp!" he adds, without prompting), and a $25 million "full ocean depth submarine", which will allow three of your guests to explore the bottom of the ocean while feasting on caviar and drinking champagne ("How many have we sold? None.").</p>
      <p>It is insane, and I find myself crying with laughter when I come across marketing material from one manufacturer that tries to make spending tens of millions on a yacht sound essential. "The simple pleasure of watching your family enjoying themselves," it says. "The quiet joy of observing your friends meet new friends. The delight at the effortless service afforded by the discreetly attentive crew."</p>
      <p>However, I battle with my sanctimony in an attempt to gain a more sophisticated understanding of the market. I remind myself that all wealth and poverty is relative and that the industry supports 140,000 jobs in the UK alone and contributes £6.2 billion to the economy.</p>
      <p>I attend (along with the likes of Tina Green and David Coulthard) the glamorous Boat International Party at the magnificent new HQ of the Monaco Yacht Club designed by Lord Foster, and talk to so many boat owners and board so many yachts that when, at one point, I am told I am being taken to the "King of Norway", I don't know whether it will be a yacht or a monarch. While there is no getting away from the inane bling of some of it, I will concede a couple of things, the first that for some owners, the yachts are a reflection of a deepseated interest in sailing.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, some owners don't use their yachts to explore the world beyond the harbours of Antibes, Capri and Portofino. And some superyachts are packed with fittings that would make Liberace blush, and basically feel like Las Vegas hotels on water. But some of the boats, like the Italian one I tour, are utterly, supremely beautiful.</p>
      <p>I went to the Monaco Yacht Show not even being able to imagine why someone would buy a superyacht, and left thinking that if I were a billionaire, I might be tempted.</p>
      <p>Another concession: for many owners, their superyachts, more than anything else in their lives, are a form of creative fulfilment. The hyperwealthy, of course, have no shortage of outlets of expression for their colossal egos. But while cars are designed by other people and houses are subject to planning limitations and local laws, you can stick almost anything on a yacht and, given the international nature of the waters you are travelling through, you can behave however you want once you're on them.</p>
      <p>The fantasy nature of the world is reflected in the stories of excess: people in the industry are full of tales - uncorroborated - of anonymous (and certainly not British) owners hiring dwarfs to water-ski around their boat; sending dry-cleaning by Learjet to New York; waking up one morning and firing the entire crew without notice; demanding that toilets be cleaned with cotton buds.</p>
      <p>But it is also reflected in the language that manufacturers use to court owners, with yacht builders at the yacht show talking about "visionary owners" and "building dreams" in their marketing literature. And in the relentlessly bespoke nature of the services on offer to yacht owners.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons there are no price tags is that every object, however mundane, is potentially on sale for infinity pounds as a result of being unique, with even a mattress manufacturer telling me that while prices start at $1,000, the potential spend is "unlimited" because "you could have them heart-shaped and made out of gold if you want".</p>
      <p>Then there is the art, which is on sale everywhere at the Monaco Yacht Show, in various degrees of quality, and some of it in a gallery that, for reasons I don't understand, has a massive Porsche parked in the middle of it. But I find myself struck in particular by the work of the Irishman Eoin Turner, whose "commissioned art", according to the literature, is "a blend of the classic and the sophisticated embodied by his unique bond with nature and his raw, evolving talent", and who has on his stand a copy of a lead crystal and cast metal sculpture of Eddie Jordan's yacht Blush, which he sold to the former Formula One team leader and which is displayed in the yacht itself.</p>
      <p>It turns out to be docked in the nearby harbour and the artist turns out to be on the exhibition stand. As he tells me that he is the "first artist to create models of yachts which are a hybrid of a model and a sculpture" - explaining that while the piece cost about (EURO)30,000 other works could be a lot more because they could be "inlaid with diamonds" and that his work appeals to superyacht owners because "they have been highly involved in the creation of their boat, which is an expression of their personality" - I can't get the image out of my head.</p>
      <p>A multimillionaire superyacht owner, sitting on his multimillionpound superyacht, admiring a possibly diamond-encrusted sculpture of the superyacht in question. I guess whether you think this is something to aspire to or a nauseating celebration of inequality, defines not only how you feel about superyachts, but how you feel about life in general.

      <p>Get your Jetty-quette right</p>
      <p>Come bearing gifts and make them count</p>
      <p>Don't even consider stepping on board without a well thought-out gift. Anything monogrammed or personalised will go down a treat. Mug up on the age of your hosts' children; there is little more embarrassing than giving a My Little Pony to a 14-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>Get involved in the actionNo one appreciates an idle guest, but make sure you know how to use the toys. True story: one acquaintance was stranded at sea when her bikini bottoms got caught up in the motor of her Sea-Doo. The hostess was mortified when a crew member went to fish out her marooned, commando-style guest.</p>
      <p>The tipping point</p>
      <p>Every self-respecting yacht owner has a policy on tipping crew. Some encourage guests to show their appreciation, while others deem tipping to be the ultimate insult. Find out where your host stands on the issue and come prepared with a wad of cash just in case.</p>
      <p>Bring your A-game</p>
      <p>Every guest should have a special skill to bring to the party. If yours is conversation, come armed with an arsenal of amusing anecdotes; if it is board games, pack your king-sized Scrabble; if you don't have a skill, find one. Fast.</p>
      <p>Compliment the host Spend at least ten minutes a day extolling the virtues of your host's yacht. A little sycophancy goes a long way.</p>
      <p>Mind over matter</p>
      <p>Avoid the pitfall of dosing up on anti-nausea medication unless you want to spend the entire trip asleep. True fact: on my first superyacht cruise I gratefully guzzled the travel sickness pills on offer and spent the next five days in a state of semi-consciousness, even falling asleep at the table - twice. I was never invited back.</p>
      <p>Drink with caution</p>
      <p>Everyone loves cocktail hour, but do monitor your alcohol intake. True story: one unfortunate friend, having ingested more than her share of wine, stumbled to her cabin only to discover in the morning that she had climbed into bed with the wrong man.</p>

      <p>The Talbot Inn Mells, Somerset</p>
      <p>The war poet Siegfried Sassoon is buried in the churchyard next door to the Talbot in this pretty Somerset village (www.mellsvillage.co.uk). It's also just round the corner from Babington House, the A-lister private members' club, and is managed by Matt Greenlees, who worked at Babington. You're in the middle of great walking country here (horse riding can also be arranged), but if you want to relax, there's a pleasant courtyard garden. The seven chic bedrooms, some with four-posters, are dotted with modern art, and burgers and steaks are served in the Grill House.</p>

      <p>Between the Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons, this seven-bedroom pub with a well-regarded restaurant is in prime walking territory. This is a downto-earth choice, with comfy leather sofas and old stone walls; it's not for you if you're after cutting-edge design. That's all part of its charm, however, and you can expect to find locals in the bar, which serves six local ales. Dishes in the restaurant might include roast mackerel and beef stew. Rooms are cosy and elegantly decorated; dogs are welcome.</p>
      <p>Details B&amp;B doubles are from £155 (01874 620111, www.felinfachgriffin.co.uk)</p>

Many of the ingredients grown in the garden are used by James Mackenzie in his Michelin-starred restaurant, which serves dishes such as salt beef hash cake with fried quail egg and roast breast of guinea fowl with garlic, artichoke and broccoli. Sit at one of the picnic tables at the front and enjoy a pint of York Brewery ale.</p>

      <title>Street fighter Putin is heading for a fall</title>
      <subtitle>Russia's president has the upper hand in Syria but the best he can hope for is a bloody nose</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>At the age of 12, a roughnecked Vladimir Putin was taught a useful lesson on the streets of Leningrad: "If a fight is inevitable," he told a Russian audience last week, "you have to hit first." Well, fifty years on, the Kremlin leader is flailing into his latest brawl, this time in Syria. His adrenaline is high and Russian munitions factories are working full tilt to provide that knockout punch.</p>
      <p>And yet for all his bravado this military adventure is bound to end in failure. At best Putin will get a bloody nose; at worst he will have set back Russian ambitions in the Middle East for a decade and he will go down in history not as a strategic mastermind but as a shallow chancer.</p>
      <p>Putin rightly, if unsurprisingly, calculates that no campaign in Syria will succeed without the use of combined air power and ground forces. The US-led coalition against Islamic State is not making much headway without a reliable and coherent land army. The Kremlin answer is an air campaign fought with 36 fighters flying five sorties a day, backed by helicopters and naval support - plus Iranian troops on the ground. Together Moscow and Tehran share the goal of preventing the collapse of the Assad regime.</p>
      <p>As this odd military alliance limbers up for its first big test - the looming Battle for Aleppo - the number of Iranian soldiers is growing by the day. About 2,000 Iranian troops, including both the elite al-Quds force and regular units, are moving into position near the northern Syrian city. They are being joined by thousands of Shia militiamen, including Hezbollah fighters and trained men from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. Qasem Soleimani, the general who has been leading a covert war on behalf of the Syrian regime since 2012, co-ordinates with the Russians.</p>
      <p>What will happen, though, when this axis is tugged apart by its divergent aims? Moscow's aim is to keep Syria intact, to be ruled by a duly grateful client regime. That entails squashing anyone in the rebel opposition who could lay claim to national leadership. The Russian plan is for a transitional government to rise from the rubble with a defanged President Assad staying in his palace albeit in a purely ceremonial role. A more weighty prime minister - the Sunni nationalist Farouk al-Shura is being mooted by the Kremlin - would be installed; the army defector Manaf Tlass (his virulently antisemitic dad Mustafa was regarded as a great friend of the Soviet Union) would become defence minister. An election could then end up bringing Tlass to power. The attraction for Tlass? He would be able to work with the Russians to prevent Syria becoming an Iranian protectorate. The drawback? He could end up castrated, dragged through the streets and strung up like the Afghan puppet Mohammad Najibullah after the Russians grew tired of that war.</p>
      <p>Russia and Iran are playing against each other. Both Tlass and al-Shura, however, are Sunnis, tainted among fellow Sunnis by their past association with Assad. Iran is not about to shed the blood of its soldiers in order to allow these men to marginalise the Alawites. That might lead, in the Persian imagination, to a grisly massacre. Iran's aim is clear: to promote itself as a nation that spreads revolution, that increases the influence across the region of its fellow Shias and to protect Shia shrines. Tehran does not subscribe to Putin's vision of a Syrian Socialist Republic that would cock a snook at Washington. Rather, it would be satisfied with a segmented Syria in which the Assad-led Alawite lands become a Arc of Destabilisation linking Lebanon to Iraq. "Tehran does not need Syria to function within its old borders," says an Iranian oppositionist. "It's not in the business of writing national anthems for anyone."</p>
      <p>Mutual suspicion already clouds the relationship between Iran and Russia. Eight Iranian generals have been killed in Syria since 2013, the highest losses since the 1980-88 war with Iraq. Nor is the war going smoothly for Moscow, despite the upbeat cockpit videos and throbbing propaganda. The more Russia bombards, the more it melts differences between the Sunnis. Its scrappy war with its broad-brush targeting is spurring Gulf states to step up arms shipments to non-Isis fighters. Suddenly rebels are becoming very effective at destroying the tank columns of the Syrian army. Money is flowing towards Russia's opponents, but oozing out of the Russian treasury. It is costing Moscow a conservative $4 million a day to run this war; soon it will become far more expensive.</p>
      <p>Putin can start wars but not finish them. His champions say this is deliberate strategy, to create "frozen conflicts" in countries deemed to be important to the Russian national interest. In fact, these conflicts have become an embarrassment, the martial equivalent of wrongly assembled Ikea wardrobes hidden in the garage. Putin's street-urchin doctrine of hitting first does not in the end win respect. Some statesmen leave their mark on history as nation-builders. Putin's legacy will be as a nation-breaker.</p>

      <title>Maurice Strong</title>
      <subtitle>Obituaries ; Canadian oil chief who championed the environment and organised the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Adrienne Clarkson, a former governorgeneral of Canada, once said that Maurice Strong had "invented the environment" - a statement that many of those now referred to as climate change deniers would probably accept. Strong, who organised the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, helped to instigate the drumbeat for environmental reform that has echoed ever since the historic event - and that resounds this month at the UN climate change conference in Paris.</p>
      <p>As both UN under-secretary-general and the founding executive director of the UN Environment Programme, Strong forced the issue of global warming to the top of the international policy agenda. His business career as an oilman - with experience in many parts of the world, including Africa - had convinced him that fossil fuels, even more than war and the population explosion, were what most threatened humanity's long-term survival.</p>
      <p>The Earth Summit was a milestone on the road to the general, if still disputed, acceptance that something has to be done if much of the world is not to be rendered uninhabitable within the next 100 years. When he addressed delegates at the summit, Strong was unambiguous in setting out his stall. "It is clear," he said, "that current lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class, involving high meat intake, consumption of large amounts of frozen and convenience foods, use of fossil fuels, appliances, home and workplace air-conditioning, and suburban housing, are not sustainable."</p>
      <p>It was in Rio that the Convention on Climate Change was agreed, providing the framework for subsequent debate and legislation on how governments should collectively address global warming. Strong was frustrated that many protocols that had been "opened for signature" still awaited ratification decades after the event, but he nevertheless took pride in the progress that was made.</p>
      <p>After devising and orchestrating the Earth Summit, he became an adviser to the UN secretary-general Kofi Annan.</p>
      <p>There were some, however, who criticised and even despised him. The oil industry, which he variously served as president of the Power Corporation of Canada and as head of the state company Petro-Canada, among other giants in the energy sector, generally regarded him as a traitor. Politicians in his native Canada blamed him for the failure of massive, transcontinental oil and gas pipeline projects. He was derided for his shadowy UN role as "an international man of mystery", but also acknowledged as "the Michelangelo of networking".</p>
      <p>Maurice Frederick Strong was born in Oak Lake, Manitoba, in 1929. A child of the Depression, he grew up next to the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway, prompting him to dream of a well-connected life different from the one he knew - one in which his college-educated father was regularly unemployed and his mother struggled for years with mental illness.</p>
      <p>At 14, he left school, where he had been a model pupil, to embark on a picaresque life that saw him work as a sailor, a fur trader, a broker and, eventually, a trainee oil analyst. He was still in his twenties when he took over the running of the Montreal Power Corporation and moved to Ottawa where - at the invitation of prime minister Pierre Trudeau - he led the Canada International Development Agency, administering foreign aid in partnership with a web of private companies.</p>
      <p>His introduction to the UN had come in 1947. Aged 18, he was given a job as a security officer at the general assembly, where he met the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt after she had delivered her acclaimed address supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A quarter of a century later, he re-entered the UN headquarters in New York as a key adviser on global warming, charged with organising a breakthrough conference in 1972 in Stockholm at which, by common consent, the vocabulary of environmentalism was born.</p>
      <p>With his first wife, Pauline Williams, whom he had married in 1950, Strong spent the next two years travelling in Africa and the Far East. They divorced, however, shortly after returning from their globetrotting adventures. She wanted a quiet life in which she could spend time with their children, while he still had ambitions left to fulfil.</p>
      <p>He was married a second time - to Hanne Marstrand, a Danish-born academic. They met at a party in New York, at which she told him candidly: "Some people say you're a genius. And some people say you're a fake." Decades after their wedding in 1981, their running joke was that she was still trying to figure out the answer.</p>
      <p>Hanne survives him, together with the children from his first marriage: Fred, a property developer; Maureen; Ken, a partner in his father's business ventures; Mary; and a foster daughter, Alice. He also became stepfather to Suzanne and Kristina, who resigned in 2005 as Strong's personal assistant at the UN after it emerged that he had broken the organisation's rules by hiring her.</p>
      <p>It was not the first time that he had been embroiled in controversy. In 1986, Strong and a group of business associates who had bought a large tract of land in the Colorado wilderness filed for the right to extract gallons of water from a natural underground reservoir and sell it for profit to a growing urban district elsewhere in the state. The Colorado department of natural resources took up the issue in support of local landowners and conservationists, who feared the environmental impact. Strong - who dabbled in Buddhism and later developed the site as a spiritual retreat - contested their assertions and fought the case through the courts, only to lose and face a bill of more than $3 million.</p>
      <p>Further controversy came in 2005 after it was revealed that Strong had endorsed a cheque for just under $1 million made out in his name in connection with the UN oil-for-food programme that allowed Iraq - then ruled by Saddam Hussein - to evade the effect of sanctions by using oil revenues to buy basic foodstuffs for its people. Strong, who admitted that one of his companies had "inadvertently" done business with Saddam, was never indicted, but subsequently resigned from the UN and left for a new life in Beijing, where he spent his last years.</p>
      <p>He was a committed leftist and a believer in good government for all, but he enjoyed his wealth and described himself as "a socialist in ideology, a capitalist in methodology". His extensive network of connections seemed to facilitate his strolls along the corridors of power. He was a personal friend of a succession of UN secretaries-general, governors of the World Bank, CEOs of multinational corporations and world leaders of every political persuasion, not only in the West but in Africa, where he was acquainted at different times with both Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson Mandela.</p>
      <p>It was said that it was Strong who introduced the US vice-president Al Gore to the urgency of saving the planet, and he who encouraged the recently elected Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau - son of Pierre - to make environmental reform one of his key objectives. He was also a fixture over the years at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where, as a former member of the Brundtland Commission on sustainable development, he consistently advocated a unified response to the issues thrown up by economic growth.</p>
      <p>Strong was the recipient of numerous honours, including the Order of Canada. Having long suffered from asthma, he died in China.</p>
      <p>Amid the global economic turmoil of 2009 - the year of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen - he declared: "The climate change issue and the economic issue come from the same roots. And that is the gross inequity and the inadequacy of our economic model. We now know that we have to change that model. We cannot do all of this in one stroke. But we have to design a process that would produce agreement at a much more radical level."</p>
      <p>Maurice Strong, environmentalist and businessman, was born on April 29, 1929. He died on November 28, 2015, aged 86</p>
      <p>His enemies despised him. The oil industry regarded him as a traitor</p>
      <p>He made it clear that current western lifestyles were not sustainable</p>

      <subtitle>Will Hide heads well off the beaten track on a thrilling ski adventure, and stays in an unusual mountain hostel</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>If you want an Alpine mountain to yourself, you don't have to spend thousands hiring it for the weekend like some dotcom billionaire. Call part of it "Ravine of the Dead"; that really thins the crowds out. They say that the luxury trend in travel for this year is escaping your fellow man. If that is the case, at almost 2,500m approaching the Great St Bernard Pass on the Swiss-Italian border, I was on the Lamborghini or perhaps Ferrari of peaks.</p>
      <p>The whole point of ski touring - strapping sticky "skins" to the underside of your skis, donning bindings that hinge at the back and then climbing high, away from the piste-clogging masses - is magnificent isolation, alone with just the snow and your thoughts.</p>
      <p>For me, ski touring is a reminder that there is more to life than whizzing downhill as quickly as possible while trying to avoid teenagers filming themselves using a selfie stick. It is a reminder to look up, not down, to pause and listen, to breathe deeply and exhale slowly, to absorb your surroundings. It is a reminder that you are Mother Nature's guest.</p>
      <p>Clouds swirled, but blue sky broke through every so often to reveal jagged peaks and, in the lee of them above us, a small cluster of squat, black-roofed buildings hunkered down against the elements.</p>
      <p>This was my goal: the thousand-yearold Great St Bernard Hospice, which was founded as a refuge for weary travellers passing over the treacherous mountains between the canton of Valais in Switzerland and the Aosta region of Italy. Napoleon came this way, as have smugglers, pilgrims, traders and, more recently, tourists. It was a place of religious contemplation from the start, and many people come to escape modern life for a night or two. In summer it is an important stop on the Via Francigena pilgrimage route from Canterbury to Rome.</p>
      <p>It is also a rescue centre. The worldfamous St Bernard dogs were stationed here until they were replaced by helicopters and German shepherds (thinner and better suited to being bundled into a chopper). The first mention of the former breed was by monks at the hospice in 1707, and the most famous was Barry, who, in the 19th century, saved more than 40 lives.</p>
      <p>The hospice is cut off by snow from mid-October to June, when the only way up is on skis or by snowshoe. The three-hour climb is not particularly arduous but can be treacherous. Two years ago, four Italians making their way here deaths by an avalanche. heed weather forecasts experienced guide, such as François who accompanied me. can use it as a base for or touring into Italy.</p>
      <p>e were swept to their e. So it is essential to s and use an experirançois Perraudin, e. Once there your off-piste skiing the small parked o the Berped We drove up from town of OrsiÈres and near the entrance to 5,798m-long Great St Bernard Tunnel. Equipped with avalanche transponders and shovels, we set off.</p>
      <p>sy I always mean to get fit for ski touring but somehow that never happens. While François effortlessly powered on, I got into a rhythm more slowly as we followed the route of the summer road, several metres below us. Every so often I would stop, partly to rest and partly to soak up the scenery, in turns bleak and breathtaking.</p>
      <p>I hummed a few tunes as we approached the steeply walled Combe des Morts, or Ravine of the Dead, as the wind whipped ice crystals around us. From here it is not too far to the hospice but, later in the season or on a day when conditions start to warm up, a crack of loose ice can send thousands of tonnes of snow hurtling at up to 80mph towards the ravine. Trapped under the snow you can be dead in 15 minutes, or www.less.No tot of brandy from the barrel of a slobbering canine will save you.</p>
      <p>François seemed relaxed, though. "On a scale of one to five of probability, we're only at a two right now," he tells me. "A lot of the winter the avalanche risk has been around three. Anything more than that we wouldn't have set off."</p>
      <p>ants " I quickened my pace as best I could; the thin oxygen made every effort seem double. There was no sound except for the crunch of snow. In another 20 minutes of rhythmic left-right, left-right climbing and grunting we reached the solid-looking, fourstorey hospice and the smiling face of Canon Raphaël Duchoud. He stood at the front door, which was partially blocked by drifting snow and has remained unlocked since 1050, when someone lost the www.key.No one has botheredmake a new one.</p>
      <p>sw b an un wke to ma Fran altoge the outs is in François and I entered an altogether cosier world from one swirling around outside. The reception desk in the dining room, turn next to the compact kitchen from which delicious smells wafted. Food - meat, fish, pasta, cheese - is delivered in bulk to the hospice in September, with an extra delivery of 650kg of bread dropped off by helicopter in March.</p>
      <p>At the end of the corridor is an ornate baroque chapel where services are held throughout the day, starting just after 7am ... after you have been woken up by Enya's Orinoco Flow, which is piped along the corridors. A small treasury houses artefacts such as a bust of St Bernard from the 13th century and a copper hand warmer from the same period. Along the corridor there is a lounge where guests gather in the evening, with a few battered magazines and board games.</p>
      <p>Upstairs are the bedrooms, dorms - functional, no frills, an air of musty socks - and private rooms, with shared showers and toilets. Up to 130 can be accommodated, and in summer there is a posher hotel next door.</p>
      <p>Outside, a small, rather macabre stone building houses some of the corpses of those who could not be rescued many years ago. It was too cold for burial.</p>
      <p>The next morning, with the sun and blue sky visible through frosted windows, I chatted to Canon Raphaël, who is helped by only four others throughout the winter. "I much prefer this season to summer," he says over coffee, bread and jam. "We are alone, and solitude is very good for us, to be quiet in the mountains. Skiers just come up for lunch then go back down before nightfall. At weekends we get a lot of people who stay for a night, and then there are those who come for a spiritual retreat, for up to a week."</p>
      <p>I could have stayed longer and climbed to some of the peaks above the hospice, soaking up the tranquillity while gazing down on Italy. However, I had to get back to OrsiÈres for a train down the mountain. My three-hour climb up was only a 30-minute ski down. We passed no one. The wind whistled through the Ravine of the Dead, protecting its history and keeping the crowds away.</p>

      <p>Marcus Binney savours the splendour of a chateau in the Loire valley</p>
      <p>For anyone in love with France, the Chateau de Magnanne is the ultimate dream, opportunity and challenge. First, you have to be able to drum up the substantial asking price of Euro 2.95 million (about £2 million) for the chateau and 145 acres. Second, according to the level-headed English owner, Nicholas Hodgkiss, you need a budget of Euro 500,000 to invest in careful repair and modernising.</p>
      <p>From the start, if you wish, you have a business based principally on weddings which can, he says, bring in £50,000 a year -at about £3,000 a time.</p>
      <p>"I provide the chairs and the tables. The caterers do the rest. There are about 30 of them around here providing food you would never see in England. They do dinner parties too," he says, adding that several hospitable neighbours give excellent lunch parties. Further income is generated from the gite sleeping 12 in a barn beside the house that can be let to wedding guests at weekends.</p>
      <p>The beauty of it all is that the weddings take place in the pavillon d'abondance - a glorified 18th-century barn -leaving you in privacy in the chateau. Magnanne, named after the silkworms once cultivated here, is said to be designed by Jules HardouinMansart, the architect of Versailles. Although there is no documentary evidence to support this, it is decidedly an essay in the grand manner of Louis XIV, ranked as a monument classe, the equivalent of a Grade I listed building in England.</p>
      <p>It stands as a noble island in a moat, which today continues round two sides, and in the classic form of a 17th-century chateau has a corps de logis, or main range, just one room deep with steep roofs, the centre and ends breaking forward for emphasis. A perron or horseshoe of stone steps leads up to the grand entrance. The front doors are exquisitely carved with garlands of fruit and flowers, knights' helms and angels' heads with wings. They open into a soaringly vertical staircase hall with stone flights arching out from the walls and carrying elegant iron balustrades.</p>
      <p>The main apartments form an 80-yard enfilade running the length of the house, with all the doors exactly in line. The glory of these rooms is the wood panelling, as rich and delicate as the best in contemporary aristocratic mansions in Paris. In style these panels are Regence -early 18th century and dating from the minority of Louis XV -with trellis work and delicate foliage. Unusually, they are never painted or gilded. The best are in the large and small salons inset with landscape scenes attributed to Lancret, somewhat ravaged by time, with carved dragon tailed birds on top of the arches. Beyond, dating from 1730, is a small chapel in one of the pimples that project from the corps de logis at either end.</p>
      <p>Part of the fun of walking round Magnanne is to enter the realm of back corridors and staircases behind the grand rooms that allow servants (and lovers) to enter rooms discreetly. The secondary stairs are all wonderful pieces of carpentry. The best is an ingenious spiral rising round an open well all of 2ft across with massive handrails formed into delicate curves from the bottom to the top of the house.</p>
      <p>The formal garden at the back of the house is framed by two projecting wings: one an orangery, the other a pavilion for hunting parties. This latter is in a completely unmodernised state with tiled floors similar to those found in a Venetian palazzo and fine stone chimneybreasts and yet more 18th-century panelling. The old kitchens in the slightly submerged ground floor are another time-warp with an ancient water pump and a vast Victorian oven. A vaulted staff room is used for parties. At the top of the house the attics are another marvel - open to the rafters from end to end with stone fireplaces that suggest they were used as large dormitories for servants. Roofs on a French chateau are huge this one is akin to the upturned hull of a ship with an inner hull of rafters within.</p>
      <p>Having seen all this, I was wondering about the first-floor bedrooms. These, six in all, open off a broad east-facing corridor and look over the garden. They are all handsomely panelled, painted in the pearl greys that were de rigueur in the second half of the 18th century but are not used at present. If you are ready to move in en tout simplicite, as the French say, with rather elementary bathroom arrangements, you can have parties of friends to stay, roaring log fires and hearty meals served from the modern kitchen and work out by degrees how to use and decorate the house. A number of pieces of fine 18th-century furniture come with the chateau, while others can be bought from Mr Hodgkiss.</p>
      <p>The marvel of Magnanne is that it is so untouched. An immediate £1 million makeover would need to be very well done indeed to avoid damaging the wealth of untouched detail. The chateau is 35km (22 miles) north of Angers on the River Loire, set in open rolling country. At the bottom of the newly planted quadruple avenue leading up to it is the River Mayenne. "You can walk the whole way to Angers along the towpath, or step into a boat and sail out to sea at Nantes," says Mr Hodgkiss.</p>
      <p>Before he bought Magnanne in 2002, the chateau had belonged to the Racappe family since the 1400s. Ownership was divided among various family members and Mr Hodgkiss spent a year establishing full title. He is now concerned to find a buyer for the chateau who will respect it for the marvel it is and give the commitment in time and money to restore it. Substantial historic buildings grants are available for repairs, he says, as well as 100 per cent tax relief on mortgage interest if you become resident in France.</p>

      <author>Andrew Billen; Body; My throwaway remark last week about the "old and easily-pleased" and their liking of Death in Paradise and New Tricks did not please older readers. I really should have made clear that the categories "old" and "easily pleased", while overlapping, were not coterminous. One of my least enamoured correspondents predicted that I would do a hatchet job on Legacy, as I had on Romola Garai's previous project The Hour, thus showing how "out of touch" I was. I really, therefore, tried to like this one-off Cold War spy drama, by Paula Milne out of Alan Judd's novel. The most I can say is I did not dislike it and that Garai as an unhappily married spy was pretty good, although she did not have enough to do.; Riskily, since BBC Four has been showing the excellent 1979 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, this was a thriller in the Le Carré mould. Others will recall Simon Russell Beale, who was the spymaster Hookey last night, only four years ago played George Smiley in radio adaptations of the Smiley novels. In the Le Carré world of espionage you should never trust a spy, especially those on your own side. So it proved on Legacy. Hookey was a sophisticated liar. The husband of Garai's character, Anna, was a sweaty adulterer called Hugo (very well done by Christian McKay). Our thoroughly good hero, Charles Thoroughgood, discovered that his father was a double agent.; Milne's dialogue hammed home the salient themes but the problem was as much with Judd's plot. It was as silly as Spooks. It involved a box of secrets about nuclear power stations buried in a golf bunker, for goodness sake - a nuclear bunker perhaps. Set in 1974 (although the aural montage at the top of the show included Jim Callaghan's voice from four years later), some tenuous connection was being made between electrical power and military might. First the trade unions plunged Britain into darkness through power cuts. Next thing it would be the Ruskies by sabotaging our generators. Playing opposite the scarily good Andrew Scott as a Soviet spy, Charlie Cox as Charles did well to make us care, even a little.; Getting Rich in the Recession is a two-part series that already seems a little out of time in allegedly booming Britain, but Lucy Wilcox's film Scrappers did make you think anew about the scrapyard trade. With demand for metal ballooning in India, China and Brazil, the owner of the Sydenham scrapyard to which the film had gained "unprecedented access" drove a Merc and wore almost as much metal on his wrist as there was in his yard. A little more care, or a less formulaic structure, could equally have turned this into a tale of recycled lives, since many of the scrappers had found work and a vocation after a previous life not of grime but crime. One of the exceptions was a charming black guy called Trevor who had faced racial bigotry when he started. He too had reclaimed his life after his days as a music manager had come to grief. He was earning more now, some weeks, but that gold disc on his wall, for Gabrielle's Find Your Way, was not what it seemed, however. When he tried to trade it in for scrap, all that glistens turned out not to be gold at all. andrew.billen@thetimes.co.uk</author>

      <p>Had Max Mosley descended those steps in Chelsea to pursue le vice anglais in the company of half a dozen French maids murmuring sweet nothings - rather than barking orders in German - it might all have been put down to a bit of a giggle. As it was, the alleged link to Nazism put it in the grey area of the law where public interest is in conflict with the right to privacy.</p>
      <p>That conflict is the topic of this year's Times Law Awards, sponsored by One Essex Court: Should people in the public eye have a right to privacy? Entrants, who must be students, law trainees or pupils, are invited to submit an essay of up to 1,000 words analysing the issues and suggesting a way forward.</p>
      <p>At stake are two conflicting principles: first, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that everyone has "the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence". On this basis, Max Mosley, the president of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), was entitled to claim his rights were abused.</p>
      <p>But that ignores Article 10 of the same Act that states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression. Hannah Brown, a barrister with One Essex Court, points out that the exercise of these freedoms "carries with it duties and responsibilities and may be subject to conditions and restrictions; for example, in the interests of the protection of the reputation or rights of others".</p>
      <p>So Article 8 emerged the winner. But, as Brown says, it was an outcome determined by the particular facts of the case. What swung it Mosley's way? In short, because the News of the World's case - that there was a political/Nazi element to the story justifying Mosley's exposure - found no favour with the judge on the facts. Mr Justice Eady indicated that he might have ruled differently had he been satisfied that there was a Nazi theme to the "party". And many might well say that in such a case, Mosley's behaviour called into question his suitability as FIA president, such that it was in the public interest to reveal it.</p>
      <p>Even then, would publication of the video on the internet have been a step too far? The judge disagreed that the alleged immoral nature of the S&amp;M activities was itself a matter of genuine public interest.</p>
      <p>What if Mosley had been a bishop? The "fact-specific" weighing of competing interests is at the ruling's heart, Brown says. "This judge was not persuaded that there was any legitimate public interest to justify either the secret filming or the publication of the 'party'. He was rightly at pains to emphasise that the weighing-up exercise must be an objective one."</p>
      <p>So what now for tabloid exposes of the goings-on of celebrities, politicians or others in the public eye? How can the media know where safely to tread? The privacy/right-to-know debate goes wider than the activities of public figures to the justice system itself. Many family courts operate in private. But, subject to children's anonymity being protected, there is a compelling case for more hearings to be in public - if only to show justice being done and answer critics.</p>
      <p>Then there are the criminal courts. Ministers have taken emergency laws to ensure the anonymity of witnesses after the law lords expressed concern over the widespread use of orders to protect the identity of witnesses otherwise fearful of reprisals. Here, the right of defendants to know who is accusing them, and of the public to see justice done, is weighed against the administration of justice and the aim to secure convictions. There is a strong case that justice must be administered in public; but others argue that ensuring justice is done in the first place is more important. Should the "right to know" be the price?</p>
      <p>In all this, judges are often the arbiters. The public may feel that a ruling was influenced by his or her age, class and views. Would a Jewish judge have decided the Mosley case differently? Journalists must try to conduct their own balancing exercise, in the hope that a judge will agree.</p>
      <p>So who should be the arbiters of this right to privacy and what falls within the "public interest" defence? Is a new framework needed to guide judges and journalists in this embryo minefield? We await your answers.</p>

      <title>SEXISM AND THE CITY: THE BROKER WHO BEAT THE 'BUNGA-BUNGA' BANK</title>
      <subtitle>Isabel Sitz earned six-figure sums in the City until her new male bosses slashed her responsibilities - and her salary. She tells Louise Carpenter how she fought back</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>This article is the subject of a legal complaint from Max Lami and Oppenheimer Europe Limited</p>
      <p>Earlier this summer, 42-year-old Isabel Sitz was competing in a fencing competition in Bruges. Although agile, fit and a good fencer, she lost. However, during the competition she learnt she'd won a far more significant fight, scoring in the process a fundamental and lasting victory for all women, but particularly those working in the City.</p>
      <p>On June 11 last year, as a former top-class stockbroker earning around £250,000 a year with bonuses, Sitz was sacked from her job at Oppenheimer Europe, a 125-year-old brokerage. Her triumph that day in Bruges was the ruling of the London Central Employment Tribunal that she had been sexually discriminated against and unfairly dismissed from her prestigious job. The ruling is extremely rare - apart from one other case, there have been a run of recent losses - mostly for the fact that so many women, already broken by their experience of discrimination, shy away from the gruelling and expensive process of going head to head with their well-resourced employers. On top of that, as Sitz herself says, sexual discrimination is so hard to prove because it is often so gradual.</p>
      <p>In 2008, her old employer, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) in London, was bought by Oppenheimer. In 2009, Massimiliano Lami, chief executive of Oppenheimer Europe, was brought on board and Sitz's female former boss later moved to a new position in the company. The office, Sitz says, changed overnight. Robert Van Den Bergh, managing director of the US equity sales team and captain of the UK client team, arrived, followed by a string of "male hires".</p>
      <p>Sitz is no stranger to how tough the City is - she seems very tough herself. Until it started going wrong at Oppenheimer, Sitz had been a stockbroker for 17 years in London and New York, building up a stellar "franchise" of clients, who, following her advice on which stocks and shares to buy in the US equity market, earned her and her various banks a great deal of money. At the same time, they ensured that pension funds and investments continued to grow, often out-performing the market.</p>
      <p>She was always fiercely clever and driven: a degree in economics followed by a master's in financial markets from the University of Madrid. At 24, she left her native Spain and her family for a firm in Washington, moving quickly to Deutsche Bank on Wall Street, New York, before transferring back to London to climb the ladder here. By the time Oppenheimer bought CICB, she had a reputation for being one of the best brokers.</p>
      <p>As Sitz is the first to point out, her discrimination was a gradual process. Slowly, she says, the subordination chipped away at her confidence. It's hard to imagine Sitz getting to that position where she couldn't look up at the sky, but that's what happened.</p>
      <p>Her eventual case was helped beyond measure, she says, by the fact that from mid 2009, whenever she went into meetings with her new male bosses, she secretly hid a tape recorder in her jacket pocket: "I wasn't doing it for any other reason than for myself," she explains now. "I used a tape to record my own thoughts at home, sometimes to help me with ideas, and because of what was starting to happen. I felt I had to keep a record almost to prove to myself that I wasn't getting it wrong, that I had a record just for my own sake. It was outrageous what they were doing to me but, you know, it chips away, so, by the end, they take your confidence, and you do think to yourself, 'Maybe they are right.'''</p>
      <p>Those early meetings, back in 2009, demonstrate the beginnings of aggression towards her. Sitz, over the period, was told to be "more humble" and that she "had an attitude problem". (She tried to bring a case that she was also discriminated against because of her race - she was told at one point that a client found her accent hard to understand - but that was not upheld.)</p>
      <p>The transcripts, which were part of the evidence presented at the tribunal, make for extraordinary reading. They were presented by Sitz's lawyers, Stone Joseph, along with the most detailed spreadsheets of comparative earnings of the male and female US equity brokers in the Oppenheimer London office.</p>
      <p>Sitz, with the help of her two lawyers, had worked "through the night, week after week", listing figures for each of the brokers, breaking down the re-allocation of lucrative accounts and, in turn, they argued, demonstrating how the male bosses at Oppenheimer Europe had, over time, stripped Sitz, plus two other female brokers, more junior to her, of those same accounts, given them "reduced coverage" or, in Sitz's case, often no "coverage" at all. (This basically translates to less commission.)</p>
      <p>In very crude terms, the best sweets were gradually taken away from her and put into the hands of her male colleagues. When she asked to share the sweets, the bosses said no - or, at best, she was allowed a paltry amount. All this had a diabolical effect on her income.</p>
      <p>The numbers were colour-coded on the spreadsheets that went before the tribunal: blue for men, pink for women. "Sorry about that," says Ruth Neil, Sitz's lawyer. "It seemed the easiest way of making it clear to the tribunal."</p>
      <p>In Sitz's case, her male bosses forbade her from contacting her old clients ever again, and then failed to provide the opportunity of earning from similarly lucrative accounts. She was given "sham" accounts instead, and then penalised for not being able to make the same kind of money as before.</p>
      <p>All the while, she alleged, there was blatant favouritism towards the new "male hires", including one of them getting 30 per cent "coverage" on an account to cover his own salary shortfall. In Sitz's case, no such arrangement was offered. Her salary was due to be slashed down to £6.08 an hour, the minimum wage, before she was finally sacked.</p>
      <p>She wasn't the only broker who was experiencing shortfalls, and this proved helpful in the tribunal. As it ruled about another male broker who "had poor trading": it was not suggested to him that he should accept the minimum wage or that he would be made redundant… "We do consider his treatment assists us in constructing a hypothetical comparator and considering how the Claimant would have been treated had she been a man." Can't get clearer than that.</p>
      <p>With her income down, and not much left to work with, Sitz remembers that she started not being able to sleep. "I'd lie awake at night with it all going round and round in my mind. I had a permanent stomachache. My head was pounding. That beautiful London sky I used to look up at, I just looked down, I didn't see it.</p>
      <p>"I remember saying, by 2011, 'I am sorry I'm not trading more.' You do just feel it's your fault, but the numbers prove that it's not your fault… when you are only left with three clients you can call."</p>
      <p>She remembers one piece of bad luck with a client who switched brokers through an overall policy change, rather than in response to her work: "The client said to me, 'We want to tell Mr Lami it is nothing to do with you.' And when I told Max Lami they wanted a conversation to reinforce that, he went, 'Oh, bad luck, Isabel.' He couldn't care less. He had a smile on his face. That image is locked on my brain. That was a terrible moment.</p>
      <p>"I'm 42 years old. You need to be assertive and positive because you are a frontperson, but I began to see the glass half empty, not half full, and that has never happened to me. I wanted to go into the office the next day and be positive, but you can't, you just can't.</p>
      <p>"Listen," she says vehemently, "this is not just about me. This happens to any woman in any job. You love what you do, you are good at it, you know it, and then suddenly you begin to doubt your own ability. There is nothing worse for a person who has worked with all their heart to have it taken away from them slowly."</p>
      <p>It was at the very end - May 14, 2012 - after she was first told that her basic £95,000 salary would be cut to the minimum wage of £6.08 an hour because she wasn't making enough, that she took time off through stress. "Every day I had gone in there thinking, 'OK, I'm gonna fight. I'll do better. I wanted to prove to them that despite this and that, I can do it. You kind of don't believe that this is happening to you, and you keep on working. I am not a quitter. They were playing mind games, too. In December 2009, I was being told I was the brightest salesperson and yet they were taking accounts away."</p>
      <p>On May 16, Sitz pleaded for more time to consider the salary slash to the minimum wage. She needed to speak to her bank, think about her options. The head of legal and compliance told her that two weeks "would be unattractive to them". After that, she didn't go in. On May 25, she told them she'd been signed off due to stress.</p>
      <p>On Friday, June 8, during a conference call, with her lawyer present, she brought up what she calls "the d-word", saying effectively that she had been discriminated against because she was a woman.</p>
      <p>On the Monday, she was fired. The tribunal ruled that Oppenheimer Europe had made no attempt to fully and independently investigate the discrimination claim: "Neither Mr Lami nor Mr Van Den Bergh were able to point to any significant steps that had been taken to implement the [equal opportunities] policy." And that, "The Claimant's allegations of discrimination were not investigated properly… Instead, they have falsely claimed that there was a real investigation."</p>
      <p>On top of that, in its ruling the tribunal made a point of saying that Robert Van Den Bergh had given "a misleading account" of why he favoured yet another male broker with an extra "30 per cent" coverage. He originally told the tribunal it was only a 10 per cent coverage and that is was "a tip".</p>
      <p>"A tip!" Sitz shouts, as we sit discussing the case today. "I mean, the tribunal judges were like, 'What? You did what? That seems an extraordinarily big tip.'"</p>
      <p>Today, with her victory behind her, Sitz seems strong and resilient. She certainly looks amazing. She has a firm, toned body; as well as the fencing, she runs and swims - once, while working on Wall Street, she swam 26 miles in the Hudson River, the only woman in a school of men.</p>
      <p>Her style is almost French - chic, understated tweed fitted shifts, nude courts and black cigarette pants. She doesn't drink, save for the odd glass of champagne (this was relevant at one stage, because there was a suggestion that the Irish client "boyos" were "mostly about beer and rugby", and that a man should take them to a rugby match).</p>
      <p>Sitz says, "I love what I do. I'm good at what I do. I have always had excellent ideas and my clients liked me. I don't want to come across as arrogant, but I'd spent 17 years working on my franchise and they took it away from me. It was like, 'I can do whatever. I can destroy the franchise of a woman. It doesn't matter, I can get away with it.'"</p>
      <p>Even looking purely at the tribunal evidence, one can't help drawing the conclusion that Sitz's US equity team was operating on a jobs-for-the-boys basis. Quite apart from how Sitz's position at the firm was being undermined, there was also insidious and casual verbal sexism. When one female broker offered to drive the staff to a barbecue at Van Den Bergh's house in Sussex, an e-mail went round featuring a cartoon of a female driver looking crazed behind the wheel. Some of the men in her office also referred to the firm as "Bunga-Bunga Securities", a play on Silvio Berlusconi's immoral and sexual shenanigans and the fact that Oppenheimer, too, was headed by an Italian, Massimiliano Lami.</p>
      <p>During another conversation, Van Den Bergh (the man who gave the new male broker the 30 per cent "tip") referred to Irish clients as a "bunch of lying, cheating, stealing, time wasters". (One wonders how he got himself out of that one.)</p>
      <p>By stereotypical City standards, perhaps such bunga-bunga jokes are schoolboyishly ridiculous. When news of Sitz's victory broke, one female City worker, unconnected to Oppenheimer, posted her own experiences in a comment online: in her office, she'd been made to sit through a meeting with male colleagues while they enjoyed a noisy video of a male friend having a threesome.</p>
      <p>The "Bunga-Bunga Securities" gag bandied around Oppenheimer Europe made headlines, of course, in just the same way as the "Crazy Miss Cokehead" insults were trumpeted in stories detailing the discrimination case recently won by Svetlana Lokhova, another former equity saleswoman, this time at OAO Sberbank's London unit. Her male colleagues wrote disparaging e-mails about her. Her tribunal ruled she was subjected to harassment and victimisation and been unfairly fired.</p>
      <p>In her case, Sitz says she was incredulous at the verbal sloppiness, although it was not directed at her in the same way. "I mean," she says, "in this day and age, you cannot say things like that [about the Irish]. And Italians don't think Berlusconi and bunga-bunga is funny. This is a company dealing with other people's money; it's a serious business."</p>
      <p>But it wasn't the jokes that almost broke her. It was the way her job, the very job her bosses told her she was so good at, was systematically undermined and her livelihood threatened while the men around her were elevated and protected.</p>
      <p>It was her friends and family who supported her, she says. Despite the evidence in the tribunal hearing, she is tight-lipped about her private life. "I'm sorry," she says. "I've always kept it very separate and very private. People have always respected me very much for that. When I work, I work; when I go home…"</p>
      <p>Children? How awful if she'd made that compromise for her career only to have the career ruined in her early www.forties.No, she says, no children, although she qualifies this with, "Maybe I will, maybe I won't. It was just something that didn't happen. Believe me, I'm very focused; if I'd wanted it to have happened, I would have made it happen."</p>
      <p>She explodes with laughter, and her lawyer, who is her personal friend and with her today, joins in. I don't doubt it.</p>
      <p>Sitz does not wear a wedding ring and confirms she is not married. But she will not elaborate. Why should women in the City still feel the need to be quiet about the emotional side of their lives, when the men are talking about their wives and having it both ways? "It's just what works for me," she replies.</p>
      <p>"I have always wanted to be judged purely on my work and on the results. I feel comfortable that way."</p>
      <p>She tells me the rest of her family are back in Spain. Her stay-at-home mother - "She's been my biggest supporter throughout this" - and German entrepreneurial father and siblings have all been a massive support.</p>
      <p>Once fired, Sitz says the decision to take Oppenheimer Europe to court was terrifying. "Of course, I was worried. I knew it would be difficult, because you don't know the outcome. I knew my career would be affected no matter what, and that it would be extremely emotional, costly and painful.</p>
      <p>"I completely understand when women say, 'Oh, it is too much, I cannot do it.' You are up against your firm; you are just one person and they throw all their lawyers at you."</p>
      <p>She says that it has never been about the money, despite Massimiliano Lami's comment to the tribunal that, "Increasingly, I think the reality is that Isabel's claim against Oppenheimer is a deliberate and cynical attempt to extract money from Oppenheimer."</p>
      <p>"It was always about highlighting the injustice. I have a close friend who has six daughters. She asked me what I would tell them." She pauses. "I don't have daughters, but if I did, I'd want them to know they don't have to put up with it."</p>
      <p>As Sitz's case became more and more complicated with the request for figures and earnings, her funds started to run out. By the end, her two lawyers, Neil and Andrej Pungerl were working virtually for free. Pungerl developed a chronic illness, which was kept from Sitz for fear of panicking her. "I couldn't have done it without them," she says, looking at Neil. "They were just… incredible. They are the most fantastic lawyers."</p>
      <p>Sitz testified for two days. "She presented us with all these Excel spreadsheets of male and female earnings," Neil remembers, "and I said, 'Isabel, we're lawyers. We are going to have to get that into some form that people understand.'" "I am very good with detail," Sitz says, smiling. "It's why my clients liked me."</p>
      <p>"I knew she'd win," says Neil, "and when she did, I was just so very delighted for her."</p>
      <p>Two other female Oppenheimer executive directors - the very women whose earnings became part of Sitz's evidence - testified against her, one saying, "She was not an easy person to deal with and someone who could not accept her own failing or bad luck."</p>
      <p>That must have been a bitter pill. "You work it out," says Sitz. "They had to admit I was a hard worker, a top stock picker. I had nothing but empathy for them. What could they do? The whole of the London office was brought out to testify against me."</p>
      <p>Right now, four outcomes face Isabel Sitz. The first is that Oppenheimer Europe will offer her a settlement that she accepts. The biggest sexual-discrimination payout so far has been £400,000, which does not sound very much given it's unlikely she will be hired as a salaried broker again.</p>
      <p>The second is that the company will offer a settlement that she will reject. The third is that it will go to a remedy hearing for the tribunal to decide a settlement. The fourth is that Oppenheimer will appeal the tribunal ruling, a route that has been mentioned.</p>
      <p>"Look," says Sitz, "if this was about the money for me, do you think I'd have gone through with all this emotion? It's about the principle. It's about the message that there need to be more senior women in the City, there need to be women whom other women can go to for help. There need to be proper routes and channels… What's wrong with wanting to be at the top, wanting to be in the same place as the men? Why not?"</p>
      <p>She is currently working on some private equity projects, which she is enjoying. Getting back into the same game, her lawyer tells me, would be virtually impossible: "Let's be honest. She's 42 now, and she'd have to start all over again, building up her client base."</p>
      <p>But Sitz says she's happy. "There is nothing better than knowing you've done the right thing. I want the truth to come out. I want people to know what happened. I hope other women will see what happened to me and know they can stand up to it, too." She beams.</p>
      <p>WHAT SHE TAPED...</p>

      <title>Piecing together the puzzle of Venetian master 'Big George'</title>
      <subtitle>exhibition ; Giorgione was a superstar in his day but few works survive. Now a Royal Academy show reveals Just how influential he was, says Michael Prodger</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The Venetian painter Giorgio da Castelfranco (c 1477-1510) was nicknamed Giorgione, "Big George", by his contemporaries because of his size. According to Vasari, the pioneering chronicler of the artists of the Renaissance, the artist also earnt his moniker because of his "moral and intellectual stature". George was big in reputation, too. During his short life he was regarded as one of the greatest painters of the age and his renown has only deepened over the centuries. Even Vasari, an unashamedly partisan cheerleader for Florence and its artists, admitted that the Venetian could "represent the freshness of living forms more convincingly than any other painter".</p>
      <p>Since his death at 33 from the plague, Giorgione has been recognised as the man who transformed Venetian art by introducing a new poetic and psychological mood into portraiture and including atmospheric landscapes in both his sacred and profane subjects that infuse them with mystery and an elegiac mood.</p>
      <p>What his enigmatic paintings actually meant often escaped his contemporaries and they continue to evade explanation even now. Giorgione was among the first painters to work in small-scale cabinet pictures for private, highly educated patrons rather than for the church or state. He influenced, too, the artists of the Venetian golden age, among them Titian, Sebastiano del Piombo and Palma Vecchio.</p>
      <p>The bigness of his name, though, belies almost everything else about him. While we know much about the lives and careers of, say, Leonardo, Michelangelo and Titian, next to nothing is known about Giorgione. Vasari, some 50 years after Giorgione's death, records only a couple of anecdotes. He was said, Vasari reports, to be gentle, courteous, amorous (he caught the plague from "a certain lady" with whom he was having "a very pleasurable affair") and an accomplished lutenist but otherwise his personality is a void.</p>
      <p>It has long been claimed that he trained in the studio of the pre-eminent Venetian painter of the time, Giovanni Bellini, but no hard evidence exists. There are only two documented commissions attached to him and both have been destroyed. He left no signed paintings and just two have roughly contemporary inscriptions on the back identifying them as his. While there exist innumerable Giorgione-esque paintings there are only a handful, according to some scholars perhaps as few as six, that are universally accepted as by him.</p>
      <p>For such a towering figure, Giorgione left a tiny footprint. So elusive is he that there are times when one doubts that he existed at all. In the absence of information myth flourishes: a challenge for the Royal Academy's new exhibition, In the Age of Giorgione. Wisely, it recognises many questions are unanswerable; it offers instead a survey of Giorgione-esque painting from the first decade of the 16th century, the span of his working life. It is an exhibition about attribution, beauty and the power of a name to affect the way we look at works of art.</p>
      <p>The 50 or so paintings include eight that are strongly attributed to him, of which four are almost certainly his. These four, the Terris Portrait (from San Diego), La Vecchia (Accademia, Venice), Il Tramonto (National Gallery) and a Virgin and Child (St Petersburg), offer a snapshot of his range.</p>
      <p>The man in the Terris Portrait, whoever he is, is undoubtedly a real person who scrutinises the viewer just as much as we scrutinise him; the old woman - La Vecchia - has sometimes been called Giorgione's mother but she could equally well be an allegory of age; Il Tramonto is a suffusing sunset landscape with two small figures, one strangely examining the other's leg; the Virgin and Child contains another landscape but with the tender interchange between mother and child the proper subject.</p>
      <p>Also included are five pictures by the young Titian - a decade Giorgione's junior - whose early style was so similar that the pair have been locked in a game of attributional ping pong ever since. Paintings such as the Louvre's Le Concert champêtre have been ascribed to one then the other in succession (it is currently thought to be a Titian). There are pictures too by Bellini, Sebastiano, Lorenzo Lotto and highly skilled but unfamiliar artists such as Giovanni Cariani and Giulio Campagnola.</p>
      <p>Most of the paintings in this exhibition have at some point been called a "Giorgione". The name itself was a growth industry: during the 16th century about 40 paintings were thought to be his. That had grown to some 250 in the 17th and thousands in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Any portrait of a young man with a melancholic expression, any mellow landscape with some uninterpretable human action, any painting of dream and lyricism, saturated colour and mood was called a Giorgione.</p>
      <p>This exhibition highlights the way a name influences how we look at a painting. Pictures that were revered as being by his hand suddenly seem lesser works for losing his name. The paintings haven't changed but something in the viewer's mind has. A great painting should be a great painting whoever painted it but, of course, things don't work that way.</p>
      <p>The paintings with the best claim to be real Giorgiones were listed by a contemporary, Marcantonio Michiel, who, 20 years after the painter's death, visited the most notable Venetian collections and listed some 11 paintings by the artist. Among the pictures in his catalogue are The Tempest (in the Accademia), The Sleeping Venus (Dresden) and The Three Philosophers (Vienna). Several of the others, though, have disappeared. To complicate things further, Michiel also stated that the landscape in The Sleeping Venus was painted by Titian and that Sebastiano del Piombo finished The Three Philosophers.</p>
      <p>Two commissions for which there is documentation are also gone. In 1507-08 he painted a work of unknown subject for the Doge's Palace which was subsequently lost in a fire and, with Titian, a series of frescoes on the exterior of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the German merchants' centre next to the Rialto bridge. Salt air and damp rapidly destroyed the paintings though there were still traces in 1936 when the remnants were taken down. All that is left of Giorgione's work for this distinguished civic commission is the ghostly remains of a nude - a nebulous field of pink paint on cracked plaster.</p>
      <p>The job had been given to Giorgione because of his exalted reputation and he painted the main frontage on the Grand Canal. He gave the subsidiary work to Titian, then little known. Legend has it that a well-wisher praised Titian's work to Giorgione believing it was his. This sent Giorgione into an epic sulk and soured relations between the two artists. The Titian remnants are in no better state than Giorgione's nude.</p>
      <p>Giorgione, though, need not have worried. After Bellini's death in 1516, Titian took on the role as the Venetian Republic's chief painter of large, public religious works. Although Giorgione could paint in such a way, as shown by the Castelfranco Altarpiece c 1500 for his home town, his skills were best suited to a smaller scale. Vasari, who saw the Fondaco dei Tedeschi frescoes before they deteriorated, couldn't work them out: "I for my part have never been able to understand his figures nor, for all my asking, have I ever found anyone who does."</p>
      <p>That Vasari didn't hold this against him was in part because he believed Giorgione had learnt his soft modelling - sfumato - from the Florentine Leonardo when he visited Venice in 1500. He may have learnt, too, from Dürer, who spent more than a year in Venice 1505-7 and whose interest in nature struck a chord with Venetian artists.</p>
      <p>What is clear is that Giorgione's paintings had a mystique from the start. The Tempest, for example, dated between 1506 and 1508, has had gallons of ink spent trying to unravel it. Its meaning was already lost when Michiel saw it; he described it simply as a "little landscape with the tempest and a gypsy and a soldier". It has also been called the first landscape in western art, an allegory of duality (male and female, town and country), a representation of the love between the gods and humans, a visualisation of the arcadian poetry of Virgil or Pietro Bembo, its figures as embodiments of Fortitude and Charity, while the latest theory links it to the foundation myth of its owners, the Vendramin family, with the suckling child and the soldier being the same person. X-rays have shown that the soldier was painted over a second nude and so the picture might well have had an entirely different "meaning".</p>
      <p>In fact, the picture may never have told a story but have been painted as a work of invention always intended to be enigmatic and so act as a catalyst to spark discussion among Giorgione's connoisseur patrons. As with the reattribution of his paintings, were the key to his subjects ever found they would also lose some of their lustre.</p>
      <p>The Royal Academy's exhibition may not bring the real Giorgione any closer - he remains the Cheshire cat's grin, or rather gently wan smile, of art - but the extraordinary beauty of the paintings gathered help show why he has always been such a fabled figure and just how profoundly he changed art.</p>

      <subtitle>When John Terry used shocking racist language in a clash with Rio Ferdinand's brother, Anton, the incident led to an explosive court case. Anton and his family reveal how the devastating repercussions ended his Premier League career. Interview: Ben Machell</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The course of Anton Ferdinand's life changed for ever nine years ago, on a bright autumn afternoon, in the 85th minute of a west London derby. Queens Park Rangers - Ferdinand's team - were winning 1-0 against Chelsea, who had already seen two players sent off in a frenetic, fiercely contested match. John Terry, the Chelsea and England captain, went down in the QPR box under a challenge from Ferdinand. The referee, however, did not award a penalty. Instead, Terry found himself being upbraided by Ferdinand for the apparent ease with which he'd hit the deck.</p>
      <p>Some mild shoving ensued. Abuse and insults were traded. Terry made a gesture to imply that Ferdinand's breath stank. Ferdinand made a reference to Terry's widely publicised alleged infidelity with a team-mate's wife, a reference which he underlined with a vigorous arm-pumping action. This verbal sniping continued as both players drifted back towards the halfway line. "F*** off"; "f***ing knobhead" - that kind of stuff. It wasn't particularly pleasant, but nor, if you've watched any amount of football, was it particularly unusual. The final few minutes passed without incident and then the referee blew for full time, giving QPR the victory that Ferdinand had always thought they would achieve. "Standing in the tunnel before the game, I just had</p>
      <p>a feeling that we were going to win," he remembers. "That it was going to be our day."</p>
      <p>He was elated. Until this point he had spent his career operating in the shadow of his older brother, the prodigiously gifted England and Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand. And despite having made more than 200 topflight appearances during spells at West Ham, Sunderland and now QPR, he had never quite shaken off the suggestion that he was somehow making a career on Rio's coat-tails. "I'd always had that thing of people saying, 'Oh, he's only playing in the Premier League because of his brother.' I had always carried that with me," he says, matter-of-factly. But having just helped QPR to victory over Chelsea, he believed he was, at 26, finally coming into his</p>

      <p>own. "It was just another game for me to show people that I should be playing at this level. Because I'm actually a very good player."</p>
      <p>spread:</p>
      <p>this</p>
      <p>imaGes.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the match, he encountered Terry in the bowels of the stadium. The Chelsea captain, he says, wanted to check that things were "cool" between them after the "banter" they had swapped out on the pitch. Still buoyed with victory Ferdinand replied that, yeah, they were cool. When he then met up with his family, who had been watching the game in one of QPR's executive boxes, he remembers thinking they seemed strangely subdued. They asked him if he was OK. Of course he was OK, he said. Why wouldn't previous</p>
      <p>Getty</p>
      <p>spread:</p>
      <p>he be OK? His girlfriend took him to one side and showed him a video that was already circulating online. And what it made clear was that during their exchange of insults, John Terry had directed the words "f***ing black c***" at Ferdinand. For whatever reason, it had simply not registered at the time - "I never heard it" - but from the footage it was hard to deny. Immediately, Ferdinand felt flushed with both anger and hurt - "which is not a very good combination" - and only his mother was able to dissuade him from seeking out Terry then and there.</p>
      <p>Within a few hours, it was a story. Within a few days, it was a scandal. The "ripple effect" of the incident - a term Ferdinand today uses often - was sweeping and more than anything he was prepared for. Both players would end up in court as Terry faced a racially aggravated public order offence charge, of which he was eventually found not guilty.</p>
      <p>A subsequent FA investigation into the incident would nevertheless see Terry stripped of the England captaincy which, in turn, would prompt England manager Fabio Capello to resign in protest in the build-up to the Euro 2012 tournament. It opened fissures throughout English football: it killed the relationship between Rio Ferdinand and Terry, who would never speak or play together for their country</p>
      <p>again. It ended the friendship between Rio Ferdinand and Ashley Cole, the Chelsea and England player who defended Terry at the trial. When, as a result, the older Ferdinand brother approvingly retweeted somebody describing Cole as a "choc ice" - which is to say, black on the outside but white on the inside - he was fined £45,000 by the FA. The whole thing was ugly. The whole thing was a mess.</p>
      <p>But time passed and football's narrative cycle churned on. Rio Ferdinand, John</p>
      <p>Terry, Ashley Cole, Fabio Capello - they all continued to ply their trade at the highest level. The only person who seemed to suffer any real consequences was Anton. The career he had worked so hard to achieve seemed to stall almost overnight, the younger Ferdinand brother slipping from public view and then drifting down the leagues and out of the limelight. "That incident shaped my future. Within six months of it, I never played in the Premier League again."</p>
      <p>But why? For a very long time, this has been impossible to know for the simple reason that he has never spoken about it and the impact it had on him. This, though, is about to change. He is the subject of a powerful one-off BBC One documentary, Anton Ferdinand: Football, Racism and Me, in which he revisits the incident and for the first time reflects on the ways in which it rerouted his life. "People need to understand the ripple effects it had on me as an individual, the effect it had on my career, and the effect it had on my family members and loved ones," he says. "We're talking about a nine-year burden. A weight of nine years on my shoulders."</p>
      <p>Ferdinand is now 35. He retired from football last year, having last turned out for St Mirren in Scotland, and lives in a comfortable house in Essex with his wife, Lucy, and their two young children, Lilah and Flynn. Having spent so much of his life being measured against his older brother, it seems a little unfair to do so here but, having met and interviewed Rio not so long ago, I can tell you that they strike you as quite different characters. Superficial similarities aside - they are both rangy, articulate and audibly from Peckham - where Rio can come across as cool and appraising, Anton is a little more wide-eyed, a little more open and earnest. Then again, perhaps he's just making up for lost time. In making the documentary, he spoke to a therapist who explained that silence, rather than righteous anger, is often the reaction of anybody who suffers racial abuse as they attempt to diminish or brush over what just happened to them.</p>
      <p>"And I was like, 'Wow. OK. Silence,' " he says, frowning and nodding slowly. "Because that's what I was. Silent." In the run-up to Terry's trial, Ferdinand issued a short, bland public statement, but that was it. He didn't</p>
      <p>even want it to go to court, but it was out of his hands: a member of the public reported Terry's words to the police, who duly charged</p>
      <p>him. Now he says he wishes he'd made far more noise. "I wish I'd just done what I'd been brought up to do, which is to speak out. But the facts are, I wasn't strong enough to do that at the time. And I can't get away from that. It's eaten me up for the past nine years that I wasn't strong enough to do it."</p>
      <p>When he talks about wishing he'd done what he was brought up to do, he is talking about his parents, who impressed on both him and his brother that they would be treated differently because of the colour of their skin. "My mother was white and my dad is black. But they both raised us to know that in society, we weren't looked on as mixed race or white. We were looked on as black," he says.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when pushing her son to and from their council estate, Ferdinand's mother</p>
      <p>would be spat upon. "I remember being on holiday with my dad and cousin and being called a monkey." He also found, to his confusion, the racism he experienced could cut both ways. "I'm not ashamed to say I experienced it within my family. My Nanny Ferdinand was black. And I'd go to her house with a cousin who was full black and I'd get a sandwich and he'd get a hot dinner. I didn't quite understand it at the time, but as I got older, I realised what was going on. So I've experienced racism from both sides. And at times it was like, 'OK, well, where do I fit?' " This existential question dogged him in other ways. Anton was nine years old when Rio made his Premier League debut for West Ham United and eleven when he won his first England cap. "From a young age I had people say, 'Oh, he'll never be as good as Rio. He's rubbish.' But my family let me know that it doesn't matter what people think outside</p>
      <p>the four walls of our flat in Peckham. That doesn't matter. We're your family, we believe in you and know you're a good player in your own right."</p>
      <p>Still, as Rio got better and better and better, twice becoming the world's most expensive defender, the expectations on Anton only grew. "In my opinion, for a large period of time, he was the best in the world in his position. And that pressure gets greater and greater, because you're being compared with a great." But by the time of the QPR game against Chelsea, in October 2011, he felt he was maturing into the best player he could be. So why, within half a year of the John Terry incident, did he never play top-level football again?</p>
      <p>First, he says, we have to understand</p>
      <p>how much abuse he began to receive almost immediately, the bulk of it nakedly and viciously racist. "I could never switch off from it," he says. "As soon as I'd step outside my house, people would be shouting abuse at me." But even inside the house, it wasn't much better. His social media accounts would be flooded with caps-lock bile, accusing him of being a grass, labelling him every racist epithet imaginable, inviting him to end his own life. "It was constantly around me. I couldn't get away from it."</p>
      <p>Then there was the hurt. John Terry was somebody he had known and somebody he had looked up to. As a younger player, he'd received a signed shirt from Terry, with an encouraging message on it, telling him that he hoped they'd one day be able to play alongside one another. "So it cut deeper than if it had been someone you don't know."</p>
      <p>As Terry's trial began and Ferdinand was questioned and cross-examined, he felt as though he had somehow done something wrong, that he was causing problems, despite the fact he had no desire even to be there. All the while, the abuse got worse and worse. Family members received rape and death threats. At one point, his mother was sent a bullet through the post. "That's when I really struggled. That's when I started to become fearful. But it was a subconscious fearfulness," he says, explaining that he pushed all these emotions down inside him, genuinely convincing himself that he was on top of things. Football, he told himself, had always been what had helped keep him sane when life was difficult. Football would help him now.</p>
      <p>Only, Ferdinand's ability to play to his usual standard seemed to have vanished. For a very long time, he says, he simply refused to accept this. "I was in denial. I still thought I was playing at the very top of my game. But I wasn't." At one point during the documentary, he visits his QPR manager at the time, Neil Warnock, who confirms this. Rather than being the alert and proactive reader of the game he had been, he was now prone to distraction, or looking off into space. In a game of very fine margins, he no longer had the mental acuity of a Premier League player.</p>
      <p>The culmination of the court case in July 2012 offered no closure. Terry's defence was that while he did direct the words "f***ing</p>
      <p>black c***" at Ferdinand, he did not do so as abuse. Rather, he was under the impression that Ferdinand had accused him of calling him that and so was repeating back the accusation, as in, "A f***ing black c***?" Ferdinand denied ever accusing Terry of using those words, but a judge ruled that it was possible that Terry nevertheless believed that he did. There was therefore doubt. Which therefore meant that the only possible verdict was not guilty.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath, it seemed that Ferdinand was the pariah rather than Terry, who despite being stripped of the England captaincy, kept his place in the national squad. He would see the back-page headlines - Capello resigning, the discord between his brother and Terry and Cole - and feel that this was somehow all his fault. "I was made to feel like that because of the abuse of social media, because of what was being said to me when I was walking down the street, because of what was being said to me when I was entering a ground or on the pitch. I was made to feel like I was the problem."</p>
      <p>After leaving QPR in 2013, he had spells at Reading, Southend and finally St Mirren, all the while refusing to accept that any of this had affected him. It was only when he was approached, two years ago, to make a documentary about his experience, that he began to tentatively peel back the plaster. For most of his life, he explains, he and Rio very rarely discussed their feelings with one another. "It was never the case that we would unwind over a drink. Instead, we would talk about opponents we were playing against and about the game as a whole."</p>
      <p>He thinks this was partly because football is not a sport that either of them believed rewarded introspection, and partly because of the influence of their father. "My dad was fantastic value; he was ever present. But the one thing you never got from him was emotion." In the documentary, though, we see the three of them sitting down and for the first time actually talking about how the case had made them feel. Rio admits he still feels guilty for having not having made more of a stand.</p>
      <p>"My initial thing was, 'Something needs to be said,' " he tells Anton. "But everyone was saying - bar a few close friends and family, Mum especially, and Dad - everyone else was saying, 'Don't say nothing. Let the lawyers deal with it. Let it go to court and it will be sorted out.' And I feel guilty sometimes, because I'm your big brother and I've always been protective. I should have come out and just said it.</p>
      <p>But I just felt powerless. All I kept thinking was, how is this happening to my brother?"</p>
      <p>Anton says that this is the last thing he would have wanted. "As much as he kicks himself and beats himself up about not speaking out, I would have had to shoulder the responsibility for it," he says, meaning that any resulting adverse effect on his brother's career would have been, in a sense, his fault.</p>
      <p>It is men who love one another clumsily but determinedly doing their best to be emotionally available. It is touching. Later, there are some tears. "My brother and my father are my heroes. And when your heroes accept your emotions, it's something that you're not used to," Ferdinand says, his voice beginning to creak and quaver. "But it was the biggest weight off my shoulders."</p>
      <p>In the years prior to this, he says that he and Rio had, by tragic necessity, started to talk about things beyond football. In 2015, Rio's first wife and mother of his three children, Rebecca Ellison, died of breast cancer at 34. In 2017, they lost their mother, again to cancer. "Over the past five years we've been forced to</p>
      <p>speak and support each other, with what has happened. But you don't quite appreciate it until you're the topic of conversation," he says. "And that was a big thing for me."</p>
      <p>Since retirement, Ferdinand has been working for New Era, a player management company founded by his brother. His job is to mentor footballers, to help them deal with the challenges faced by young professionals, whatever they may be. Given that the number of racism-related incidents reported at football matches has risen by over 50 per cent in recent seasons, he hopes that the documentary will encourage the victims to see that they have done nothing wrong, that they are not causing problems, that silence is not the way to respond. At the end of the programme, he sends an email to Terry, hoping to start a conversation. It is not giving too much away to report that he is still awaiting a reply.</p>
      <p>Ferdinand shrugs and says that he didn't reach out in the interests of personal closure. "It's never been about me and him and whether he wants to say anything to me. That's irrelevant. This is bigger than me and him. The reason I wanted him to be on the documentary was that I would love to have a conversation with him solely about how we can make a positive change within the football community, and potentially have a ripple effect on society. What would be powerful is having two of the people involved in one of</p>
      <p>the biggest incidents within English football coming together to help the next generation," he says. "And if that day comes, then great."</p>
      <p>For all the pain and the loss of a career that might have been, Ferdinand is not bitter. He is a young man who has done, by the standards of young men, a far from straightforward thing: he has learnt to accept, understand and talk about his feelings. Which he encourages us all to do. "You don't have to harbour emotions that you can actually speak out about, whether that's with your loved ones, friends or the people you are working with. You don't have to hold on to feelings that can actually hurt you. Being a father, I want my son to be emotionally in tune with himself," he says. So after nine years of feeling a weight on his shoulders, he is unburdened. "The more and more I talk about it, the lighter I'm starting to feel," he finishes, smiling warmly. "I'm hoping I can watch this documentary with my son. And if he says, 'Dad, are you crying?', then I can go, 'Yeah. I'm crying.' " n</p>

      <title>Abortion in marriage: I was barely coping with two children</title>
      <subtitle>Vicky Pryce's termination was the talking point of her trial. Emma Beddington was a mother of two when she and her long-term partner decided to end her third pregnancy</subtitle>

    <text>
      <p>People tend only to talk about certain types of abortion, I think. We talk about the abortions that are a regrettable necessity for the very young and the very vulnerable, or where the foetus has catastrophic abnormalities, for victims of sexual violence and women at risk of death or mortal injury. We talk, too, by way of contrast, about abortions framed as thoughtless, selfish acts, an alternative to responsible contraception.</p>
      <p>Yet many women have abortions in circumstances that fall far short of this standard of last resort and with varying degrees of soul-searching. My abortion was one of those.</p>
      <p>I was 30 and in a stable, long-term relationship. I already had two children. My partner and I had enough money, a roof over our heads, no health or relationship problems. It wasn't a particularly easy decision, but it was absolutely the right one.</p>
      <p>When I realised I was pregnant, we had just moved to Paris with our two year old and our new baby and it was becoming increasingly clear it was a mistake. My mother had been killed in an accident a few months previously and we had left behind family and friends at the time we needed them most: we knew no one in Paris and the area we were living in was chilly and unwelcoming.</p>
      <p>My partner left early and came home late and my days were a fog of infant demands and bewildering grief, walking round the park with a buggy and an infant in a sling waiting for someone to tell me to get my toddler off the grass or that my baby should be wearing a hat.</p>
      <p>When my post-Christmas bloating and queasiness persisted into late January, pregnancy crossed my mind, but it seemed wildly unlikely. It had taken more than a year to conceive our first child, only slightly less for the second, I was still exclusively breastfeeding and we had sex about as often as any couple with a tiny baby and a toddler: hardly ever.</p>
      <p>When I finally took a test, I stared at the two lines, incredulous, my mind awash with cognitive dissonance. The other two times I had been in this situation had been utterly joyful and part of me couldn't help but see this positive as exactly that: positive. The rest of me knew it would be a disaster: I was barely coping with two children, hanging on by my fingernails. I kept the news to myself for the best part of a week as the two impulses warred in my head.</p>
      <p>When I did finally tell my partner, sick with nerves, as if the telling would finally make it real, he was worried, and ambivalent. His concern was less the prospect of another child - he had taken to parenthood with far more grace and assurance than me - than my ability to cope. My mother's death was still a raw wound, and even before she died I had struggled with postnatal depression and bulimia.</p>
      <p>While there was any doubt, we had to keep our options open, so we set the wheels in motion to arrange a termination. There was a sort of officious administrative momentum to the process that I followed, unquestioning. We felt like sheepish teenagers: our stupidity (and I did, absolutely, feel stupid) had thrown us into a situation we couldn't resolve for ourselves and we were at the mercy of the professionals.</p>
      <p>So I sat, as if waiting for detention, in a hospital waiting room full of nervous teenagers and had a rough internal examination from a stern consultant who rolled his eyes at my stuttered attempts to explain my situation. I was measured and questioned by an anaesthetist who advised me to lose weight, eyeing my stomach disdainfully.</p>
      <p>Then I watched as the familiar white fuzz and dark oval appeared on a flatscreen television and an ultrasound technician pointed out limb buds, the umbilical cord, a flickering, pulsing heart; the fabulous stubborn persistence of life. I was ten weeks pregnant. Finally, with a conjuror's flourish, he flicked a switch on his monitor and the sound of an urgent, galloping foetal heartbeat filled the room.</p>
      <p>I left the clinic with a sort of relief, as if absolved of making a decision: surely I couldn't go ahead now? But that certainty dissipated and I did nothing: the date of the abortion approached, we signed papers, filled in forms. My partner and I talked, fruitlessly, in incoherent circles.</p>
      <p>The last preparatory phase of the process, and the one that would make it definitive, was a pill to dilate the cervix, to be taken eight hours before the procedure. As I sat that evening holding the foil blister pack, clarity descended and the pleasant delusion I had been nurturing fractured like crazy paving. What on earth had I been thinking? I couldn't have another child. I had no reserves of courage or patience, no support system, no belief that everything would be OK. Looking after two tiny children in those circumstances had already pushed me to the limit, my sense of self was eroded to the point where I barely knew who I was any more.</p>
      <p>There was, actually, no option, no decision. It would have taken a very strong and selfless person to parent another child in those circumstances and that wasn't me. I took the pill. The parallel life of an advancing pregnancy and a summer baby evaporated in a tiny, noiseless mental explosion. It was difficult to imagine I had entertained the possibility. It seemed ludicrous.</p>
      <p>At 4am, I got up and took the Metro across town to the clinic in the dark, alone (my partner had to stay with the children). The decision taken, it was now simply a process of putting one foot in front of the other, out of the station, along the road, into the ward. I put on a gown and paper hairnet and perched on the edge of the bed, examining the ceiling tiles as the grey dawn started to shade the sky. Eventually, the porters came and I lay down on a trolley as they wheeled me off to the basement. In pre-op, a gentle nurse held my hand and spoke soothingly to me as panic started to dim the periphery of my vision with dark spots, then I was unconscious.</p>
      <p>In a matter of minutes it was over and I was awake, groggy and confused. After a quick checkup I was discharged, home with only a plaster on my hand to show for the morning's events.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, I sometimes felt angry with myself for getting into that situation, but there was no regret, and no sadness. If anything, I was surprised how little having an abortion affected me: I knew it was the right decision. Motherhood is an extraordinary, all-consuming adventure and I still struggle with its challenges. I can't imagine embarking on that journey without my heart being in it.</p>
      <p>When I first wrote about abortion four years ago, I was pleased but not surprised to hear from a number of women who confided similar experiences to mine: women for whom the timing was wrong, who felt too old or too young or who didn't want a baby then, or ever. Human beings are fallible, mistakes happen and all sorts of women have abortions: mothers, married women, women with careers and stable relationships. I wish we felt more able to talk about it, because by failing to speak out, we make room for the rhetoric that abortion is acceptable only as the distasteful last resort of the desperate.</p>
      <p>My main emotion when I think of my abortion - and I rarely do - is gratitude. I was able to exercise my choice safely and legally and I'm overwhelmingly grateful to those who fought for my right to do so and to the organisations and the doctors and nurses who continue to do this unglamorous, unpopular and utterly essential work.</p>
      <p>There was no option, no decision. I took the pill</p>
      <p>After a stressful move to Paris and the recent death of her mother, Emma Beddington, above, was faced with a difficult choice</p>

      <title>Beating Isner a tall order for spirited Smethurst</title>
      <subtitle>Neil Harman sees a promising display from young Briton but the American freak of nature wins in straight sets</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>John Isner remains a freak of nature. Watching him on No 3 Court yesterday try to make his many gigantic components move in the appropriate direction was as absorbing as witnessing the praiseworthy attempts of Daniel Smethurst, Britain's fifthranked player, to find a way to shake the giant tree from North Carolina.</p>
      <p>Isner is into the second round of the Championships thanks to a 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Smethurst, who challenged the American in a robust, heartening way, managed to read his serve a fair degree more accurately than a lot of players and should, on reflection, have been able to walk away saying he had won a set at least. It was not quite to be for the world No 234.</p>
      <p>The United States has the third highest number of players in the men's draw this year, ten, including one seed - Isner - and three players who successfully qualified, Ryan Harrison, Alex Kuznetsov and Denis Kudla, of whom the latter was the one survivor from the opening skirmishes. As Isner walked up the steps back to the locker room - you could have seen the top of his back-to-front peaked cap from the high street - his compatriot, Jack Sock, called out: "Hey, grass-court specialist."</p>
      <p>What wouldn't the US give to have found one of those again? Their most recent singles finalist here was Andy Roddick five years ago and yesterday Roddick was discussing his newest venture, as part of the management of World Team Tennis - a hybrid event that has never cottoned on anywhere else but in America - with the Austin Aces. He is also now an analyst across all sports for Fox television and will no doubt soon be gaining a reputation for trenchant comment.</p>
      <p>Isner is a quieter type. Dan Evans, sitting next to me as the match against Smethurst unfolded, commented what a youthful face the big man has. He probably looks no older today than he did in his freshman year or when he joined the tour seven years ago.</p>
      <p>"Truthfully, I didn't think I'd be able to do what I'm doing at all," he said. "I remember telling people in college, 'Yeah, I think I can break even playing tennis, go out there and have fun.' But I have surprised myself. I didn't have professional aspirations growing up at all. I remember finishing college in my sophomore year, going home and not even touching a racket for two months, just going fishing and hanging with my friends."</p>
      <p>There is something of The Waltons about him, a homely 29-year-old who would say goodnight to all his relations before heading up to bed. Ask him to be the standard bearer of the sport at home and he'd become distinctly queasy. "American tennis has been criticised and rightfully so," he said. "US tennis fans are a little spoilt. In the Nineties and early 2000s, where I am [No 11 in the rankings], I could have been the fourth-ranked player and not even in the Davis Cup team but it has changed so much. You've got to go a long way down from me to find the next player and there isn't the buzz about US tennis right now, there aren't a group of players putting together good results. I sort of bear the brunt of that, I guess.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud of what I've done in my career. Finishing top 20 four years in a row is pretty good. Looks like I could be on track to do that again. I work extremely hard at what I do, I don't ever publicise it, I don't tweet about tennis. I don't even watch much tennis when I'm off the court. I'm coming into here fresh. When I first started on grass I hated it but now I'm so eager. Last year I finally felt I was starting to play very well on the grass and I hurt my knee, which was a bit of a freak. If there is a tournament I'm going to do extremely well at, it is this one."</p>
      <p>What is imperative for Isner is not to get involved in too many elongated matches - you know, the 11-hour, fiveminutes type that created Wimbledon history in 2010 but left him powerless to play in the following round. "I'm extremely tall, I'm pretty heavy too - the heaviest on the tour, 236lb, a lot to lug around the court - and if I play a long match I'm going to be more worn out than my opponent. It takes me longer to recover.</p>
      <p>"I look after myself really well, I play a lot of short points but long matches takes a toll, I'm absolutely beat. We came back on the third day [versus Nicolas Mahut], I hadn't let go of the match, I had all the adrenaline, I was super stiff but I had the energy and once it was over I sort of exhaled and let go of it all."</p>
      <p>Smethurst first came through these gates as a seven-year-old and, as "a regular punter" since, marvelled how a player such as the 5ft 6in Olivier Rochus, of Belgium, could manoeuvre the ball around the court so brilliantly. Imagine what it had to be like to find yourself up against someone of 6ft 10in who sometimes does not seem to be caring about what he does with the ball.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old from Failsworth, Greater Manchester acquitted himself superbly, he has a fine tennis brain, he did not melt in the atmosphere - "I had no idea the crowd involvement would be so great," he said - and has enough going for him to move higher than his present ranking. Again, we have a British player of talent, whose ranking suggests he doesn't quite do himself justice. Smethurst is determined not to follow the regular pattern.</p>
      <p>"I actually felt very relaxed out there," said Smethurst, who managed to work his way to seven break points on the famed Isner serve but could not find a way to convert any of them. "I put so much into the first set and I realise that over five sets you cannot play with that intensity all the time. The mental side is going to be vital for me."</p>
      <p>Three to watch Caroline Wozniacki v Naomi Broady Can the 24-year-old from Lancashire, at No 164 on the WTA tour, carry the momentum gathered on Monday to take on and beat the former world No 1, who is putting her own life back together again? Maybe not. Wozniacki in two Ernests Gulbis v Sergiy Stakhovsky The pride of Latvia against the stalwart of Ukraine, this is a match to savour on No 12 Court.</p>
      <p>Stakhovsky beat Roger Federer at the same stage last year, Gulbis still finds grass difficult to appreciate. Gulbis in four Bernard Tomic v Tomas Berdych The final match on No 1 pits the many crafts of the Australian enfant terrible against the big man from the Czech Republic who has been to the final here before. It all rests on Tomic's attitude. Berdych in four Words by Neil Harman</p>
      <p>Serving notice: Isner saw off Smethurst 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 and sees the grass of Wimbledon as his best chance of success</p>

      <title>A fitting death for a multimedia Mujahid</title>
      <subtitle>ideas Osama bin Laden Creating terror to be seen by millions, the al-Qaeda leader lived by the media sword - and died upon it, says Simon Sebag Montefiore</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The hit on the global impresario of spectacular slaughter was characteristic of his career and legacy in every detail. Everything about Osama bin Laden was a hybrid that one has to describe with hyphens: a 21st-century terror-showman with a 7thcentury programme, projected by a combination of traditional Koranic preaching and hi-tech webcam slaughter, sometimes bloody with the old curved Arab scimitar, sometimes airborne and jet-propelled, sometimes earthbound and remotecontrolled, but always homicidal and exhibitionistic, beamed to an audience via the 24-hour news and web.</p>
      <p>More than any computer-gamester, he had turned mass killing into a nihilistic live performance that, in the uninhibited glee of its medieval butchery, was designed for two audiences - not only to inspire its jihadi followers but to shock and terrify its Western audience. This was a man of history - yet utterly of his time.</p>
      <p>So the manner of the death was appropriate too: he provided a spectacle that he understood better than anyone. His last moments were beamed from the cameras in the commandos' helmets to be observed on broad screens thousands of miles away in the high-tech Situation Room by President Obama and his aides, amid a familiarly undergraduate mess of takeaway detritus, polystyrene coffee cups and gaping laptops. However high tech, though, this prize was won with old-fashioned espionage and commando derring-do.</p>
      <p>Instead of unmanned drones or bunkerblasting bombs, the assassination was carried out by athletic, adrenalin-fuelled warriors sliding down ropes and risking all: this was a throwback to those dashing Israeli raids to Beirut, Tunis and Entebbe of the Seventies and Eighties - or further: the very codename used for the target, "Geronimo", suggests that the planners of this mission, perhaps even the unflappably unromantic President, were reaching back in time for the lucky grit of the Old West. Hours earlier, the world had been watching a different televised-web spectacular, the joyous wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, another hybrid, this one of modern celebrity and romantic fairytale - and yet even this world of Arthurian chivalry had been touched by bin Laden - not just in the vigilance against terror but in the figure of the best man, Prince Harry, who had won his laurels in the Afghan war caused by bin Laden.</p>
      <p>Barack Obama's triumph is one of the few certainties of this event. In that moment, the golden-tongued liberal, recently forced by the egregious Donald Trump to prove his birthplace, metamorphosed into the victorious warlord, surely unbeatable in 2012: his remarkable oration evoked the "empty seat" at the table of 9/11 families and the vision of America's special mission in history under God - but without George W. Bush's naked evangelism. If 9/11 momentarily stunned America, it has ultimately strengthened America's sense of its sacred exceptionalism. Ironically bin Laden, puppetmaster of jihadi suicidebombers, has created an American martyrology. Though not all of the near-3,000 victims of 9/11 were American, most of them were, and they died precisely because they were Americans. Ground Zero has become the American Martyrium.</p>
      <p>Inevitably bin Laden will join the pantheon of martyrs to those who crave them - he is already hailed by Hamas and others as a holy martyr. In this sense, the fugitive of the Pakistan badlands nowagain becomes a political force for al-Qaeda. His death with his son Hamza harks back to the seminal Islamic martyrdom: the beheading of the Prophet's grandson Hussein with his family at Kerbala in 680, a death especially revered by the Shia festival of Ashura (though the severe Sunni bin Laden despised Shia as heretics). More directly this recalls the 1966 execution by President Nasser of Sayyid Qutb, a visionary of latterday jihadism. Bin Ladenism is Qutbism -a belief that a self-appointed revolutionary vanguard, spearheaded by martyrs, should use sacred violence to create the caliphate ruled by Islam and destroy America, the West, the Jews, Islamic heretics and faux-Muslims, ending the new jahiliyyah, the word used for the Reign of Ignorance before the Prophet.</p>
      <p>Bin Laden was never even close to achieving any part of this nightmare, which only makes his butchery all the more sickening: he never threatened American power, and never could control more than a failed state, Taleban Afghanistan - so al-Qaeda's atrocities were always futile. Like it or not, bin Laden lived and died with all the mystique of a legend of old, belonging to a long Islamic tradition of mysterious warrior-visionaries.</p>
      <p>His life somewhat resembles the strange lives of leaders such as Ibn Muslim, the charismatic, millenarian chieftain (so mysterious that even his real name can only be guessed) who emerged in the 740s in Khorasan to lead the revolution against the Umayyad caliphs whom he regarded as decadent faux-Muslims. His fervent jihad, with its black banners, like Osama's men more than 1,000 years later, fought its way across Iraq in its campaign to restore the purity of Islam - until his murder by the new Abbasid Caliph, al-Saffah, in 755.</p>
      <p>However vile bin Laden's career, his ascetic life on the run, escaping American cannonades and ambuscades on humble mules through mountain passes of the tribal badlands, is mythic enough without adding a mysterious death. The President eschews the trophyism of the gruesome photograph of the dead quarry just as Queen Victoria was said to be disgusted that Lord Kitchener of Khartoum kept the skull of the Khalifa as an inkwell on his desk - yet it is sure to leak. In the absence of a body, bin Laden will never die to some: there was a reason that murdered kings were laid out in state for all to see. There will be shrines. It is only a matter of time before al-Qaeda fighters see Osama fighting with his lucky Kalashnikov in the fray just as Crusaders storming Jerusalem saw St George fighting alongside them in battle.</p>
      <p>The terrorist known as "al-Amir" - the General, the Prince - and "Sheikh Osama" was inspiring, gifted, soft-voiced and physically impressive. All leaders are actors but bin Laden was a master of the media, having photographs reshot if they did not promote the right image, planning his poses for TV interviews, taking as much trouble with his image as Hitler. He cultivated austere Robespierrean virtue and the gentle modesty that tricked those around Stalin and Pol Pot. But such serenity was easy for obsessional monomaniacs convinced of the certainty of their divine/historical mission.</p>
      <p>In this sense the Islamic fundamentalist was not so far from the Bolshevik atheist Stalin who saw himself as a "knight in a military-religious order". One of Osama's estranged, surviving sons recounts his bullying dogmatism and insouciant presumption that his adepts, even his family, should die for his cause.</p>
      <p>Three big operational ideas are bin Laden's legacies. First, al-Qaeda - "the Base" - was a new concept, the first global terror brand, the first murder bank, run like a fastfood company franchised out to faraway places and unknown neophyte fanatics who would be aided with logistics, cash, technology, expertise. Most revolutionaries, such as the Bolsheviks, and most espionage organisations used similar cell systems for security but never on such an international scale.</p>
      <p>Until 9/11 we believed the internet would simply spread freedom and Britney Spears. Instead Osama's al-Qaeda embraced television and the internet, using both to spread the jihadist bacteria by old-fashioned preaching, the adieus of suicidebombers, shots of training fighters in masks and those atrocious money-shots of exploding American tanks in Iraq. Bin Laden gained his confidence in Afghanistan, where he and his fellow Mujahidin were able, with American aidandAllah'sbacking,to humiliate the Soviet superpower. Lawrence of Arabia perceived that a caravan of 2,000 cameleteers could hold down an entire Ottoman army, and bin Laden updated this for a new age: an even smaller caravan of 19 suicidists could use the fuel of jumbo jets as flying bombs to destroy the twin towers, gleaming showpieces of US power, live on 24-hour television. This was not bin Laden'sinvention: in1909,Russian Social Revolutionaries had planned to fly a dynamitepackedbiplaneinto the Winter Palace(Emperor Nicholas II's impressive secret police therefore monitored airclubs and flyingschools).</p>
      <p>Israeli intelligence had long feared suiciding aeroplanes. But the scale, ingenuity, planning, spectacle, flintheartedness and sheer insolence belonged to the diabolical vision of bin Laden. The Amir was recorded boasting that others had believed the towers would only burn, but he alone, the actor-manager of mayhem, and the son of the builder of Saudi skyscrapers, was the optimist who knew they would fall.</p>
      <p>Amazingly the complicated pieces of the 9/11 plan actually worked - thanks to satanic luck and Western naivety. Even bin Laden could not have imagined that he would lure America into not just Afghanistan but also Iraq, where his new style of al-Qaeda insurgency bewildered the American hyperpower even if he and his commanders spent the next nine years being hunted and smitten. Nonetheless, he never again achieved the effect of 9/11: had there been a live camera at Christ's crucifixion in AD33 Jerusalem, it's hard to imagine that it could be any more poignant.</p>
      <p>America's "Wanted Dead or Alive" tradition is a part of its culture, but there's always the danger that it oversimplifies. But in this case it is justified: bin Laden more than anyone has shaped the events of the 21st century. There would have been no al-Qaeda, no 9/11, no Afghan, no second Iraq war, no Iraq insurgency without Osama just as there would have been no Bolshevik revolution without Lenin, no Islamic Iran without Ayatollah Khomeini.</p>
      <p>Yet the capture of Saddam Hussein showed the limits of individual influence. President Obama has won a redemptive victory, yes; but al-Qaeda will seek spectacular vengeance, its fanatics - from Yemen to the British Midlands - will try to wreak mayhem beyond their numbers. The Arab Spring certainly outflanked bin Laden.</p>
      <p>Al-Qaeda claimed the Spring as an anti-American, anti-Zionist Islamic awakening when actually the protesters on the streets of Cairo, Benghazi and Damascus craved freedom and neglected to mention the evils of America or the plight of the Palestinians. Still, it is early days: the revolutions are all different; each is local; the path to democracy is uncertain and the momentum may easily swing back to Islamicism.</p>
      <p>As always the effects will be felt most keenly in the cockpit of the Middle East and the setting of Islamic Judgment Day: Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>The Arab Spring has reconciled the Palestinian factions, which may jumpstart the peace process. But the leaders of Hamas praised bin Laden as a holy martyr - hardly reassuring to those who claim that organisation as a sheep in a wolf's clothing. State-backed Islamicism is far more perilous than al-Qaeda: Hamas and the ascendancy of Hezbollah in Lebanon, not to mention the regional paramountcy and nuclear arming of their patron, Iran, clearly show that militant Islamicism is prospering, regardless of the death in Abbottabad of a fugitive with kidney failure.</p>
      <p>In the iconography of evil, Osama bin Laden will rank high even though he was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocents, nothing like the millions of Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, who deployed the power of modern states. Mercifully, Osama bin Laden never achieved such power, but he punched above his weight. Hitler and Stalin believed also that their killings were just but must be unseen. For bin Laden it was the opposite: he designed his killings precisely to be watched. He lived by the sword and camera - and died on it.</p>

      <title>Californian finds special relationship in UK</title>
      <subtitle>The Times has long been the place to announce a marriage or engagement. One couple tell us their story</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Jenette Coduto, 32, owner of a lingerie company, and Matthew Lee, 35, a solicitor, will marry on September 3, 2016, at the Belmond El Encanto hotel in Santa Barbara, California England was new territory for Jenette when she bought a one-way ticket from San Francisco to London in 2009. "I was young, single, and wanted to do something different," she says.</p>
      <p>London was not immediately everything that Jenette had hoped for. "It was a bit of a shock to the system," she says. "It wasn't Notting Hill." She had given up her job in California as an architecture consultant. Within three years of moving to London, she had set up a film company with a director, producing short promotional films.</p>
      <p>Jenette was introduced to Matthew through a mutual friend in 2013. They met at a bar in the City. "I couldn't believe my luck," he says. "She was very engaging and enthusiastic." They swapped emails and then Jenette pretended to need Matthew's help finding her way onto the Northern Line, which involved him escorting her to the Underground. "I was probably a little bit naive," he says.</p>
      <p>Matthew sent Jenette an email the next morning and they met for dinner a few days later. He was then living in Queen's Park with a flatmate. She was in a shared house in Primrose Hill. They began to cycle to see one another.</p>
      <p>"We don't like to sit still,"Jenette says. They enjoy art, architecture and theatre. "She's quite gregarious, which is one of the things that I love about her most," Matthew says. "She sees things from a different perspective and has a fantastic sense of humour." Jenette describes him as "task-orientated, which is good for me. I sometimes have a big idea. Executing it is the problem."</p>
      <p>Raised in Los Angeles, California, Jenette is the second eldest of seven children from a large Italian-American family. Six months after meeting Matthew, he flew to California with her to meet her family. The setting was a birthday party for Jenette's then oneyear-old niece. "A bit of a baptism of fire," he recalls.</p>
      <p>Matthew grew up in Somerset and studied English at the University of Birmingham. He worked in the film industry for six years as a film production coordinator, and has since trained in media and entertainment law. Jenette has a degree in architecture from California Polytechnic State University, where her father was dean of civil engineering.</p>
      <p>In January, Jenette launched the full collection of her lingerie brand, Standard Drawers. "I have always loved undergarments," she says - and recommends that one of the first things women do on moving in with a man is to replace their underwear. Matthew is now a stitching aficionado.</p>
      <p>They bought a flat in Islington together in April. Their sale was delayed and they ended up staying with a friend. On a Friday night, Matthew pretended to Jenette that they had been invited to a friend's drinks event at the Soho Hotel in London. As they took the lift, he came clean that there was no party and that he had booked a room as a "treat". She was so excited that she hardly sat still long enough for him to propose.</p>
      <p>They decided on California for their wedding next month. In May, Jenette flew out first and then Matthew joined her for a weekend to look at venues. They booked the Belmond El Encanto hotel in Santa Barbara, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, for a civil ceremony and invited 40 guests. "We want it to be as relaxed as it can be," he says.</p>
      <p>Jenette chose her Jenny Packham dress online. Her posy will be California poppies, which are the state flower. The ceremony will take place outdoors and her father will walk her up the aisle as a jazz band plays Harry Nilsson's Over the Rainbow from the soundtrack to the film You've Got Mail. A friend will read Shakespeare's Sonnet 116.</p>
      <p>Tables on the terrace will be names of streets in London where they met for dates. The dress code is "California chic", which befuddled some British guests. Jenette describes it as blazers and ties for men. Even Matthew struggles to understand her Americanisms at times. "Every now and again, she will say something and I have no idea what she is talking about."</p>
      <p>I wanted a change - so I bought a one-way ticket to London</p>

      <title>A room of one's own in Virginia Woolf's garden</title>
      <subtitle>Literary breaks As the first guest at a studio in the grounds of the Monk's House, Louise Roddon finds time to write - and bake</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>In the gardens of Monk's House, the idyllic Sussex retreat where Virginia and Leonard Woolf spent their last years, National Trust visitors are cooing and sighing over borders of foaming blooms.</p>
      <p>"Just look at that!" cries an artylooking woman, pointing to the sweet peas and irises. "How simply lovely - Leonard's legacy of course." And then she spies me and our eyes lock. A tense moment in this teashop-free haven, for here I am, hidden by lavender bushes, surreptitiously drinking tea and scoffing a warm scone with cream and jam.</p>
      <p>As the first holiday guest to stay in the property's adjoining garden studio, I'm enjoying a rare sense of privilege. Not for me the afternoon limitations of the ordinary National Trust visitor. I'm free to bake scones in my kitchenette, then to wander at will, soaking up the atmosphere of this exquisite Bloomsbury outpost. And when the gate closes, I can stretch out on springy lawns and conjure the ghosts of Virginia and Leonard and their erudite guests: T.S. Eliot, Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster - imagining the games of bowls and idle intellectual chatter that accompanied their evenings here.</p>
      <p>This has to be one of the most blissful of National Trust holiday cottages, primarily because you're not stuck out on the edges of some grand estate - instead, Monk's House is so small, so intimate, that you feel very much part of the property.</p>
      <p>My studio was originally the garage storeroom to the Woolf's 17th-century weatherboarded cottage. The couple lived intermittently in this Rodmell retreat from 1919, with Virginia writing some of her best-known novels here until she drowned herself in the nearby Ouse river in 1941. Leonard remained until his own death in 1969, but in the couple's heyday, Monk's House was transformed from a cold, damp and primitive shell, to the distinctively Omega workshop-decorated warren of rooms that you see today.</p>
      <p>And the studio echoes that Bloomsbury touch, though pristinely so - rather as if Olga Polizzi had time-travelled to the Woolf's abode, bossily shaking dusters and cleaning agents about the place. It is like the bedsit you never had - with a soft green colour scheme, and room for a double bed, two armchairs and desk, alongside a tiny kitchen and bathroom.</p>
      <p>There are lovely touches too: a set of Virginia Woolf's novels, including her diaries; a DVD of The Hours, a vintage Roberts radio and Ordnance Survey maps, as well as drawing pencils and her favoured blue writing paper. These I make full use of, interspersing my days with hikes beneath the maternal folds of the Downs and along the opaque milky-green Ouse, then reading, and working on my novel among the snaggle of Monk's House's brick-laid paths and gardens.</p>
      <p>For Bloomsbury fans, Rodmell is perfectly placed. On a day's walk, you could take in Vanessa Bell's home, Charleston, then the murals at Berwick Church, painted during the Second World War by Vanessa and Duncan Grant.</p>
      <p>But just as lovely is simply staying put in what Virginia described as "an unpretending house, long and low ... " Better still, time your break to include a Monday, when Monk's House is closed, and you can gorge on scones without a shred of guilt.</p>

      <title>The chef who taught Gordon, Marcus and Marco to be tough</title>
      <subtitle>Over the past 50 years, Pierre Koffmann's kitchen has been a hothouse for the greatest talent in British cuisine. He tells Tony Turnbull how he became the country's most influential cook</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>This year Pierre Koffmann celebrates 50 years in the kitchen. Not just in charge of a kitchen, like so many chefs who run their operations at arm's length, but actually standing at the stove, getting his hands dirty, cooking day in, day out.</p>
      <p>That's a remarkable achievement for any 67-year-old, given how physically gruelling a chef's life is (when did you last spend 14 hours on your feet?), but all the more so when you consider Koffmann never had a burning ambition to be a chef, and only wound up in England because he wanted to see France beat England in the rugby at Twickenham. He planned to stay six months, but instead went on to earn five Michelin stars - the first two as head chef at the Waterside Inn under the Roux brothers and three more of his own at La Tante Claire in Chelsea.</p>
      <p>In the Eighties and Nineties it was not just the standout French restaurant in the country but the standout restaurant of any style. Forget Harveys, forget Le Gavroche, this was where diners came for proper grown-up cooking, to try Koffmann's famous pig's trotter stuffed with sweetbreads and morel mushrooms, or his pistachio soufflé, to experience the glorious confluence of grande cuisine and country www.cooking.No chef before or since has been able to extract such flavour from such humble ingredients.</p>
      <p>Equally remarkable, though, is the roster of chefs he has helped to inspire. As the queue at the dining-room door grew, the queue at the kitchen door grew just as quickly as the young turks of the day sought to learn from the master. Koffmann says modestly that you can't make racehorses out of donkeys, in which case, what prize colts he had passing through: Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsay, Marcus Wareing, Jason Atherton, Tom Aikens … Through them he has left an indelible mark on British cooking.</p>
      <p>"I remember the day Marco arrived in the kitchen in 1984," says Koffmann, his French accent undimmed by 45 years in Britain. "He said: 'Can I work with you, chef?' I said: 'Yes, you start on Monday at 8am.' Monday, 8am, no Marco. He arrived at 8.30 and I said: 'Marco, not good. We start at 8am.' 'Yes, chef,' he said. Next day, 8am, no Marco. I said: 'Marco, you are not working here any more,' but he asked for one more chance and on Wednesday he was on time.</p>
      <p>"I had a delivery of duck and pigeons and normally I'd bone them myself, but he said he'd do it for me. And he did it as well as me. From that day we never had a problem. He was Marco, of course, but he worked very, very hard."</p>
      <p>Ramsay he remembers as already being very accomplished when he arrived, although he does say he spent a lot of time on the phone arranging his next step to world domination. Jason Atherton was a pleasure to work with; Éric Chavot was "brilliant, probably the best chef in England".</p>
      <p>Could he tell immediately that they were special? "Not on the first day, but after a few weeks, yes. It's a mental thing. They need to want to be a good chef. If a guy doesn't want to learn, I'm not going to take him by the hand. He's got to have a passion, and then it's easy to show him everything."</p>
      <p>Sitting at a table in his eponymous brasserie in the Berkeley Hotel, Koffmann is charming company, softly spoken, but with a very British sense of humour. "I work Monday to Friday, every service. The weekend, I go to church," he deadpans. Yet he has - or certainly had - a fierce reputation. They called him Pierre the Bear, for his grizzliness rather than his hugs.</p>
      <p>"Not a teddy bear, certainly. I'd shout, but there'd be no punching. Tough, certainly, but everyone is tough. Gordon is not nice. Marco is the same. Some people only stayed a day, it's true, but after work on a Friday we'd go to Chinatown and all be friends again."</p>
      <p>His protégés don't look back in anger."Pierre influenced me more on the plate than any other chef I've ever worked with," says Marco Pierre White, who after leaving La Tante Claire went on to become the youngest chef to be awarded three Michelin stars, aged 33. Today, he is one of half-a-dozen of the French chef's former employees to get together to celebrate the career of their former mentor at Koffmann's - a precursor to a pop-up event at the London Taste Festival next month. There are two other Michelin-starred chefs (Éric Chavot and Bruno Loubet), a high-end chocolatier (William Curley), a quality meat merchant (Richard H Turner, the co-founder of Hawksmoor) and a young gun, 25-year-old Ben Murphy, who recently opened the Woodford in east London to great acclaim.</p>
      <p>"This may sound controversial, but Pierre Koffmann is not a leader of chefs, he is a chef who inspires many generations of chefs," says White. "All I want is for people to realise the impact he has had on the food in Britain today."</p>
      <p>The biggest lesson he learnt from Koffmann, he adds, is that "perfection is lots of little things done well". For Bruno Loubet, this includes Koffmann's butchery and breadmaking skills, and his cooking at the stove. "No laughs, no noise, no bullshit," he says. "Just cooking."</p>
      <p>"We learnt directly from the best," says William Curley, who worked with Koffmann in the early Nineties. He remembers learning to make his own filo pastry, "something I've not seen anywhere else", such was the chef's determination not to buy anything in that he could make better himself. Which is pretty much everything.</p>
      <p>Jamie Oliver didn't work for him, but he too fell under the Frenchman's spell. "When I was a young chef I always dreamt of working in his kitchen and used to save up with my other chef mates to go and dine at La Tante Claire," he wrote recently. "It's so funny as he made such an impact on us young aspiring chefs that when I finally met him I was speechless and a bit shy. That's a first for me."</p>
      <p>Koffmann grew up in Tarbes, in southwest France, the son of a mechanic. His mother, he says, was a very good cook, but it was his maternal grandmother who shaped his love of rustic cooking, of cuisine du terroir. He would spend every holiday on his grandparents' farm 60 miles north, deep in the Gers countryside. What he learned from her informed his critically acclaimed cookbook, Memories of Gascony.</p>
      <p>"She was very restricted in what she could cook, as almost everything had to come from the farm. Chicken, duck, rabbit, guinea fowl … " Nothing was wasted. "When you are young, you are always hungry. The Sunday roast was always chicken and I loved the head, neck and feet. I'd share the stomach with my sister and we'd each have a piece of string full of fat and salt, which was like the best chewing gum in the world."</p>
      <p>He wasn't academically bright ("I was only good at mathematics") and when he left school at 14, his options were to enter the local industries of tank or train manufacturing or join the catering college. He chose the latter because he wanted the security of still being at a "school". "I was lucky. I enjoyed it," he says understatedly.</p>
      <p>After four years working his way around restaurants in France, he came to England in 1970 and in 1972 was asked to help Michel and Albert Roux open the Waterside Inn. He left five years later to open his own restaurant on the site, on Royal Hospital Road, of what is now Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, and within six years had attained three stars.</p>
      <p>It has not quite been uninterrupted kitchen service since. He closed La Tante Claire, by then relocated to the Berkeley Hotel, in 2003, after his first wife died, but retirement didn't suit him. "I'm not one to sit on a deckchair. I'd go fishing and mushroom-picking, but you can't do it every day. I'd get up at 9am, go for a cappuccino, wonder where to have lunch, go home for a little siesta and that's it. I did it for a year, and Claire [his new partner at the time, now his wife] said if you do that you'll be dead in a year. So I did consultancy for a bit, which was nice money for not doing a lot."</p>
      <p>Then in 2009 came the offer of a week-long pop-up at Selfridges in London, which he accepted "because I'm stupid". The week turned into eight, during which he served 3,200 pigs' trotters, and he was hooked again. The next year he opened Koffmann's in the Berkeley again but a different room to where he had La Tante Claire.</p>
      <p>The menu is full of the things he loves to cook and eat: snail ravioli with bayonne ham, braised beef cheeks in red wine, and yes, pied de cochon, Tante Claire. "That dish will be on my gravestone when I die. Everywhere I go I have to do pig's trotter, but I do it with a smile. It's better to be known for something than not remembered at all.</p>
      <p>"I like the ambience of the kitchen," he says. "You are with young people. It's crazy sometimes, but it keeps you young." This enthusiasm for the new is one of his most beguiling traits. He is as happy in a Thai restaurant in Bayswater or a new chicken and cocktail joint in Hackney as he is in a Michelin-starred restaurant, and still takes great pleasure in seeing each new generation emerge from under his wing. Marco's son Luciano is earning his dues in his kitchen, and he's particularly proud of his latest prodigy, Ben Murphy. "I like young chefs," he says simply.</p>
      <p>Such famous alumni were never going to let Koffmann enjoy a quiet 50th anniversary year. In addition to his appearance at the London Taste Festival, there's a party in August to coincide with the publication of a new book, Classic Koffmann, and rumours that he'll be cooking alongside Gordon Ramsay again.</p>
      <p>Not that any of this will keep him long from his beloved restaurant, where the cooking shows the same peerless mastery of technique but is simpler than in the Tante Claire days. "We still buy the same quality ingredients, but we don't do the extras you've got to do to please Michelin. We seat 80-90 people compared with 40, and it's much more what I like to eat. At Tante Claire I started out cooking what I liked, but you change and you cook something you don't like but it looks nice on the plate and you've got three stars to keep. I didn't enjoy it at the end."</p>
      <p>Does he feel that his simpler cooking forms a bridge to his childhood, I ask. He looks at me as if I am crazy. "No, I'm not the type to use my brain like that," he says. "I cook because I know nothing else. If I had to stop cooking, I don't know what I would do."</p>
      <p>Pierre Koffmann will appear with Marco Pierre White and guests on the first night of Taste of London. It takes place from June 15-19 at Regent's Park, London; www.tasteoflondon.co.uk</p>

      <title>Grandfather's off-the-cuff advice led to a healthy portfolio</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THE BEST investment advice Roy Garthwaite was ever given came from his grandfather 60 years ago, Susan Emmett writes.</p>
      <p>"We were in his furniture shop. A customer came in and bought a role of linoleum.</p>
      <p>When she left, he said to me: 'That linoleum will be worn in five years. I have just bought some land. They are not making any more of that.' His words stuck with me."</p>
      <p>Garthwaite took the message on board and over the years has built up a solid portfolio of property investments that now includes Real Estate Investment Trusts (Reits). He bought Land Securities last year before the company became a Reit and British Land in January.</p>
      <p>The change in the tax law means that property companies can now operate in a much more tax-efficient way, boosting profits for their investors.</p>
      <p>News that Reits were being launched in the UK inspired many investors to get in early to gain the most benefit from the new tax rules. "I had it in mind that Reits were coming in. It was a bit of forward planning. As a chartered accountant, the tax aspect interests me. But having said that, you don't buy a share for the tax benefits. You can't let the tax tail wag the investment dog."</p>
      <p>The shares are held in an Individual Savings Account (ISA), which spares Garthwaite from paying income tax on his dividends. Their value has fallen a bit since the start of the year after the clamour around the time of the conversion to Reits in January died down, but Garthwaite is unfazed.</p>
      <p>"I'm not worried about a fall. In the long-term property values will come back."</p>
      <p>Garthwaite has been an investor in property over a number of years and has seen the value of bricks and mortar go up and down. As well as owning his own home in Mirfield near Leeds, he has a holiday house on the North Yorkshire moors, a few small shops bought years ago and half a chapel which is let out as a day nursery.</p>
      <p>However Garthwaite has resisted trading up or down the property ladder. "I bought the land my house is on from Wimpey in the 1970s. They were doing a development nearby. I didn't actually build the house with my hands but I was involved in the building process. I have no intention of moving."</p>

      <title>Average hockey mom? The gun-toting beauty queen aiming to be the Veep</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>She hunts, fishes, and eats moose burgers. She is such a keen runner that she named the first of her five children Track. She is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association and was runner-up in the Miss Alaska beauty contest in 1984.</p>
      <p>In short, this self-styled "average hockey mom" is the kind of all-American girl to gladden the heart of the Republican party - and yesterday Sarah Palin delighted it even more by virtually wiping out coverage of Barack Obama's acceptance speech in Denver on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Mrs Palin may have been Alaska's Governor for a mere two years, but she is wildly popular, with an approval rating of 80 per cent. She ran in her gubernatorial campaign as a clean-government reformer and scourge of wasteful spending, a message that resonated strongly in a state beset by political corruption.</p>
      <p>But for all her strengths, both parties know that her nomination is a risk for John McCain. Just two years ago she was the mayor of the Alaskan town of Wasilla, where the biggest worry is if there will be enough snow for the annual dog-mushing race. Before her two terms as a councillor in the same town she was a sports reporter for a television station in Anchorage.</p>
      <p>Since she took office in 2006 as Alaska's youngest governor, and first woman to hold the post, she has delivered on many of her campaign promises. She took a pay cut, dispensed with the gubernatorial jet, and successively killed the infamous "Bridge to Nowhere" project that had become a nationwide symbol of wasteful spending that Mr McCain has made a cornerstone of his campaign. "As governor I've stood up to politics as usual," Mrs Palin said. ""I've stopped wasteful spending, cut taxes, and put the people first."</p>
      <p>A fiscal and social conservative, she is also strongly "pro-life" and belongs to Feminists for Life. She opposes gay marriage, although she says she has gay friends. She has also admitted in the past that she smoked marijuana when it was legal in Alaska - but didn't like it. Born in Idaho, Mrs Palin has lived in Alaska since she was three months old. She once worked as a commercial fisherman with her husband Todd, her high-school sweetheart and a native Yup'ik Eskimo. It was was their 20th wedding anniversary yesterday. Her husband works for BP, is a champion snowmobiler - a passion she shares - who has won the 2,000-mile "Iron Dog" race four times.</p>
      <p>They have three daughters, Bristol, 17, Willow, 13, and Piper, 7. In April she gave birth to another son, Trig, after refusing to let the results of prenatal testing that showed he had Down's syndrome affect her decision to have the baby. He was asleep on the shoulder of one her daughters during her speech.</p>
      <p>At the rally in Ohio last night Mrs Palin was given a raucous reception during a poised and forceful speech in which she displayed clear signs of grit, a muscular, family-oriented conservatism, while also reaching out to the disaffected supporters of Hillary Clinton. "I would be honoured to serve next to the next president of the United States," she declared, with four of her five children behind her. "I know it will demand the best that I have to give, and I promise nothing less."</p>
      <p>Her son Track will be deployed with the US Army to Iraq on September 11, she added. "As a mother of one of those troops, John McCain is the kind of man I want as our commander-in-chief."</p>
      <p>Her description of herself as an "average hockey mom" was a clear bid for America's swing-vote suburban mothers and disaffected Hillary Clinton Democrats. In her speech she heaped praise on Geraldine Ferraro - the only other woman to be named on a major presidential ticket, in 1984 - and Mrs Clinton, and got her biggest cheers when she said: "We can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all!"</p>
      <p>Thrilled as they were, Republicans knew straight away that her choice was highly risky. With Mr McCain turning 72 yesterday, and having suffered two bouts of skin cancer, Mr Obama's campaign wasted no time in raising the question of his age and Mrs Palin's lack of experience.</p>
      <p>"Today, John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency," said Bill Burton, an Obama spokesman. And, in her one vice-presidential debate, she will be up against the seasoned foreign policy veteran Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Mr Burton also criticised Mrs Palin for her support of oil drilling in the Alaskan wilderness and her anti-abortion stance, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States.</p>
      <p>"Governor Palin shares John McCain's commitment to overturning Roe v. Wade, the agenda of Big Oil and continuing George Bush's failed economic policies. That's not the change we need, it's just more of the same," he said.</p>
      <p>Mrs Palin's lack of experience undercuts Republican charges that Mr Obama is not ready to be commander in chief. Mr McCain said in April that he was determined to avoid choosing someone like Dan Quayle, the little-known Indiana senator whom George Bush Snr put on his ticket in 1988. The choice proved embarrassing. Quayle "had not been briefed and prepared for some of the questions," Mr McCain said.</p>
      <p>Pat Buchanan, a conservative who twice sought the Republican nomination in the 1990s, said: "This is the biggest political gamble I have ever seen. She is enormously exciting but if, God forbid, something happens, can she be president?"</p>
      <p>Mrs Palin was closely vetted by the McCain team because of an ongoing ethics investigation by the Alaskan legislature over claims that she used her executive position to try to get her sister's former husband, Mike Wooten, an Alaskan state trooper, fired from the police force after their divorce.</p>
      <p>Another potential problem was that she was endorsed in a 2006 television advert by Ted Stevens, the Republican Alaskan senator recently indicted on corruption charges.</p>
      <p>Mr McCain passed over several men for his choice, including Mitt Romney, his former presidential rival, and Tim Pawlenty, the Minnesota Governor. He had been keen to pick a women for months, and declared yesterday: "She's got the grit, integrity, good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in Washington today."</p>
      <p>* FROM BEAUTY PAGEANT TO GOVERNOR'S MANSION</p>
      <p>Sarah Palin is 44</p>
      <p>At high school she acquired the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" for her fierce competitiveness as the star of the basketball team</p>
      <p>She won the local Miss Wasilla beauty contest, in which she was named "Miss Congeniality", and was a runner-up in the 1984 Miss Alaska pageant, right</p>
      <p>She has worked in a commercial fishing business with her husband Todd, of Alaskan Eskimo heritage, and as a television sports presenter</p>
      <p>He is of Alaskan Eskimo heritage through his grandmother and is a four times champion of the 2,000 mile "Iron Dog" snowmobile race</p>
      <p>Her children are named Track, Bristol, Willow, Piper and Trig</p>
      <p>The eldest is going to serve in Iraq next month and the youngest, who has Down's syndrome, was born this April</p>
      <p>At 32, she was elected mayor of Wasilla, population 9,000</p>
      <p>She has a reputation for cracking down on government waste</p>
      <p>She was championed as a heroine for resigning as head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in 2004, after highlighting ethical violations by another commisioner</p>
      <p>She was sworn in as Alaska's first female and youngest ever governor in December 2006, despite missing so many campaign appearances that she was tagged "No Show Sarah" by her opponents</p>

    <text>
      <p>Each new US Administration sees the ritual cull of at least one Cabinet nominee. As George W. Bush's candidate for Labour Secretary is forced to step down, Ben Macintyre reports on Washington's passion for blood sports</p>
      <p>On my first visit to Washington in 1989 I was taken to the bar of the Willard Hotel, a favoured watering-hole of the political classes. As we sat down, my companion nudged me and pointed to a burly, bowed figure sitting alone in a corner, staring deeply into his drink, a picture of dejection. "That's John Tower," my friend whispered. "And that's what Washington can do to you."</p>
      <p>A few weeks earlier Tower, a former senator from Texas, had been rejected as President George Bush's nominee for Defence Secretary after one of the nastiest confirmation hearings ever held. Tower, the first Cabinet nominee to be turned aside since 1959, had raged against the unfairness of his treatment and the accusations of "drinking and womanising" that had ended his career: "There is no finding that I have ever breached established legal and ethical standards or been derelict in my duty," he insisted, to no avail.</p>
      <p>And so now he sat alone in a bar, an image of how the mighty can fall, and of how purely brutal American politics can become at its highest reaches.</p>
      <p>More than a decade later, another such sacrificial victim has been dispatched. Linda Chavez, President-elect George W. Bush's choice for Labour Secretary, never even got as far as a confirmation hearing, but the accusations, denials and manoeuvring that preceded her withdrawal followed an almost ritual pattern of political blood-letting.</p>
      <p>An outspoken conservative, Chavez's opposition to affirmative action and a minimum wage had already provoked howls of protest from liberal Democrats and union leaders, but within hours of her nomination a far more serious, and ultimately lethal, objection had been unearthed. In the early 1990s, it emerged, Chavez had taken into her home a Guatemalan illegal immigrant. The woman had been given money by Chavez, and she had performed household chores.</p>
      <p>Chavez and the Bush transition team insisted that Marta Mercado had been a guest, not an employee, that the work she performed had been voluntary and that the money she had been paid represented pocket-money, not wages. Bush's opponents claimed that the woman aspiring to oversee and enforce labour laws, including those applying to immigrants, had violated federal law by employing an illegal immigrant.</p>
      <p>Pressure mounted, Republican support began to waver, the Bush team was publicly supportive and privately furious that the immigrant problem had not been discovered in the vetting process. Finally, on Tuesday night, Chavez reluctantly committed hara-kiri on live television, but not before she added to the sense of ritualistic drama by parading a number of former immigrants before the cameras to testify to the help she had given them in starting new lives in America.</p>
      <p>"I just want to say that I love Linda very much, she's like a second mother to me," lisped a young Hispanic girl in a performance that must have left the Bush team squirming.</p>
      <p>Ms Chavez withdrew "with regret" and asperity, insisting that she was the victim of the "politics of personal destruction". "The game in Washington is a game of search and destroy," she declared. And while her other statements about her relationship with Mercado remain questionable, this one was entirely correct.</p>
      <p>The nomination and confirmation process has always provided an opportunity for post-election score-settling. One side wins, the other then has the chance to do what it can to derail the people selected for senior positions by the winner. If Chavez's fate sounds familiar, that is because it almost precisely followed the rules of an increasingly ruthless game.</p>
      <p>Exactly eight years ago, the boot was on the other foot, when Bill Clinton's nominee for Attorney General, Zoe Baird, was found to have employed a nanny without paying taxes or social security. On that occasion it was none other than Linda Chavez who declared: "I think most of the American people were upset during the Zoe Baird nomination that she had hired an illegal alien. That was what upset them more than the fact that she did not pay social security taxes."</p>
      <p>Clinton's second choice for Attorney General, Kimba Wood, had to drop out for similar reasons in what became known as "Nannygate". One of the ironic aspects of those fights is that the woman who eventually became Attorney General, Janet Reno, was confirmed by a 98-0 vote in a Republican-controlled Senate, but has turned out to be perhaps the most controversial appointment Clinton ever made.</p>
      <p>Four years ago the veteran New York Times writer, R.W. Apple Jr, complained that the confirmation process was not what it used to be. "The old 'give the guy a break' mentality, the old inclination to use camaraderie to soften partisanship, has faded, to be replaced in some instances by a hard-edged, sometimes bitter enmity," he wrote.</p>
      <p>But if such camaraderie was rare when that observation was made, it has all but evaporated now, after the heart-hardening experience of the impeachment battle and one of the most bitterly-fought elections in modern history. The political confrontations of recent years have forged an atmosphere of almost Hobbesian aggression, in which political careers are ever more likely to be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short, and only the dullest or most thick-skinned survive: nobody in American public life is safe from inquisition, and since nobody is perfect, the imperfections will always out.</p>
      <p>As Chase Untermeyer, former personnel chief under President Bush, recently observed, the confirmation process tends to begin with "the presumption of vileness of everybody who serves in public office".</p>
      <p>The Senate still confirms the vast majority of nominees by a President or President-elect. Between 1981 and 1994, 98 per cent of the 720,000 people selec- ted for positions requiring approval were confirmed with no difficulty. But at the same time, the higher-profile confirmations have become ever more controversial. Some critics argue that the procedure has now become so gruelling that the best candidates are not prepared to face it, and a recent independent inquiry panel concluded that the process has become so politicised and intrusive that it is "undermining the very trust in government it is supposed to foster".</p>
      <p>Too often, the issue of competence or qualifications is lost amid a welter of partisan revelations about immigrant nannies, personal behaviour and past pot-use.</p>
      <p>Clinton could hardly conceal his relish at the prospect of a confirmation fight over Chavez. Addressing a union meeting in Washington this week, the President complained that his staff had banned him from telling Chavez jokes in public. "I cannot say any of the things I wanted to say, which would leave you howling in the aisles," he observed, with a glint.</p>
      <p>Since the election there has been much talk, but precious little evidence, of "bipartisanship" - one of those meaningless but comforting phrases like "the American people" that US politicians feel obliged to use at regular intervals. But with the Senate now divided 50-50, the coming confirmation hearings may be among the most contentious. From the outset, the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, has made it clear that his party is prepared, even anxious for a fight: "A fair hearing doesn't mean you just roll over and say we'll take whomever you send down."</p>
      <p>In the Kennedy administration, the average wait for confirmation was 2.3 months; under Clinton the average nominee waited 8.5 months, and in the current febrile climate the delay is likely to be still longer.</p>
      <p>US history suggests that when power is divided, either within Congress or with one party controlling the White House and the other the Senate, then confirmation hearings are likely to be particularly bloody - for example, the rejection of two of Richard Nixon's Supreme Court nominees, Clement Haynsworth and Harrold Carswell.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court nominees, since the appointments are for life, are more intensely scrutinised and more often refused, and many trace the general brutalising of the nomination process over the last decade back to the Senate's rejection of the Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, whose name consequently became a verb.</p>
      <p>"To Bork," says former Senator John Danforth, "meant the relentless effort by interest groups to wage a political campaign against a nominee, creating a grotesque image of the person in order to build public pressure."</p>
      <p>Chavez did not survive long enough to be Borked, but groups opposed to her were mobilising to do just that, and while she may be the first casualty of an embittered political process, she is unlikely to be the last of Bush's nominees to be barbecued thus. With Chavez falling on her sword - or being pushed on to it - attention is returning to John Ashcroft, Bush's nominee for Attorney General, whose uncompromising conservative views make him an inviting target for the left.</p>
      <p>Advocates of gun control, abortion rights, gays and lesbians, and civil rights groups are joining forces to attack the former Missouri senator for his alleged views on race, abortion and other incendiary issues. Leaders from more than 200 groups, an unprecedented coalition, have joined a "Stop Ashcroft" campaign.</p>
      <p>At the same time Gale Norton's nomination as Secretary of the Interior is facing stiff opposition from environmentalists who condemn her support for opening wilderness areas to oil exploration. Christie Whitman, the New Jersey Governor and Bush's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, may face further grilling over her 1993 disclosure that she and her husband had employed two Portuguese for more than three years when they were in the country illegally.</p>
      <p>"Confirmation has become a blood sport," one Republican senator observed recently. "Everybody in town knows that."</p>
      <p>The first kill has been marked up, the scent of blood is in the air, and the full pack is about to be unleashed. By the end of this political hunting season, there may be several more hunched figures looking like a John Tower in the bar of the Willard Hotel.</p>

      <title>A fish in wolf's clothing</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>When I first arrived in London more than 30 years ago I was puzzled to discover that the natives had a habit of queueing at fish and chip shops to buy something called rock salmon. I expect they fondly imagined some great silver fish, a-leaping and a-skipping up wild Scottish rivers towards romantic spawning grounds 'neath brooding mountains.</p>
      <p>This ugly creature is in fact an habitue of the murky depths around Britain's coastline and is called a dogfish, as well it might be. I suppose that expecting people to salivate at a counter while ordering dogfish and chips was thought by the marketing folk to place hope too far ahead of experience, so the dogfish had to be given a name makeover.</p>
      <p>The British have a curious attitude to food names, leading to considerable confusion. I have, on fishing trips, been asked by passing tourists if I ever caught any scampi. Butchers sell us lamb but do not, apparently, stock any cow, mad or sane.</p>
      <p>These thoughts arose last night during Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers' Guide (BBC2). Stein, visiting the fish market at Peterhead in Scotland, leapt with enthusiasm upon a wolf fish, a creature so ugly it must be related to the dogfish.</p>
      <p>You do not, in your average seafood restaurant, get head waiters pointing you eagerly towards the wolf fish and that is because it appears on the menu, if at all, as rock turbot. Why anyone would wolf down a rock turbot but not a wolf fish is a mystery.</p>
      <p>What I like about Stein is that, unlike most other television chefs, he makes the connection between the food and its source. Last night he went out on a giant fishing trawler, which had a bridge whose hi-tech instruments and swivel seats made it "look like a conference centre".</p>
      <p>Although understandably admiring of the men who catch the fish (this is the most dangerous job in the world), Stein is prepared to show us his unease: "I've never seen a bigger trawler than this, it's a real fish killer. Thank goodness there aren't too many boats like this around, otherwise there'll be no fish left in the sea."</p>
      <p>Of course Stein makes a pile of money, at his fish restaurants in Cornwall, out of buying and selling the fish that are left in the sea.</p>
      <p>The point is that he understands what his (and my) love of fish is doing to stocks and tries to mitigate the effect by using new and less fashionable creatures.</p>
      <p>Hence the wolf fish, which Stein turned into a tasty looking dish. He even took us out in another boat with the purpose of not catching anything. The idea was to show how inshore boats used to catch halibut on 900-hook lines baited with mussels. On this trip, they caught not a single halibut.</p>
      <p>The "fish killer" was catching herring, 150 tonnes of it every time the nets were hauled. Now there is another fish that seems to have gone out of fashion, a delicious, oily creature that Stein shoved under the grill and served with a mixed salad.</p>
      <p>Given the influence television chefs have on supermarket demand, perhaps we shall now see more herring on the slabs. And indeed in the fish and chip shops, where it will be cunningly disguised as rock pilchard.</p>
      <p>They don't seem to have anyone who could be mistaken for Rick Stein cooking the food in Parkhurst prison on the Isle of Wight, to which Martin Narey repaired last night in Back to the Floor (BBC2).</p>
      <p>Narey was thinly disguised as a humble prison officer. Make that transparent, for inside about five minutes Narey had revealed his true identity to a prisoner. "It's a fair cop, guv, you've got me bang to rights. I am indeed the Director-General of the Prison Service."</p>
      <p>Well, no, Narey didn't actually say that but it was soon apparent that the whole prison knew who he was. It's hard to know who is worse off in jail: the prisoners or the warders. The latter have a slight advantage in that they can fail to turn up by pretending to be sick, which is apparently an indication of low morale in the service.</p>
      <p>One officer told Narey: "The only thing I've ever known the Prison Service to do is get good, conscientious staff and just keep kicking them until they say, 'enough's enough'. Well possibly, but Narey is clearly convinced that many warders are swinging the lead and he is now planning to introduce a bonus system.</p>
      <p>This appears to mean that a prison officer gets a salary for doing the job and on top of that he will get a bonus if he actually turns up for work. What a fabulous idea. It would dovetail nicely with paying the prisoners not to escape. Surely a similar scheme could be introduced to keep Stan Collymore at one club for more than a week. Why did the Government not think of paying people to visit the Millennium Dome?</p>
      <p>Narey has the sort of job for which the phrase "thankless task" was invented. There are 43,000 prison officers. The men clearly think that is not enough, but the management consultants called in while this programme was being filmed decided 43,000 was too many, so cuts are planned.</p>
      <p>Narey spent some time checking out the newly privatised system, known as a canteen, whereby prisoners can buy extra goods each week. A mixed picture. One chap ordered three phone cards, they sent him three lollipops. Another said: "I ordered a bag of potatoes, they sent me six bags. What am I going to do, open a fish and chip shop?"</p>
      <p>Funny you should mention that, sir, there's a man on the very same channel where you have just appeared who can get you lovely wolf fish, trade prices, no questions asked. I assume you will pay me to eat it.</p>

      <title>HP strikes decisive blow in seven-year Autonomy battle</title>
      <subtitle>A jury has sided with the US company after their $11.7bn deal led to a series of allegations, writes James Dean</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>It was a crushing blow from Lady Justice, and not only for Sushovan Hussain.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, after deliberating for three days, a jury in San Francisco condemned the former finance chief of Autonomy to what could be a long stint in an American jail.</p>
      <p>In doing so, it also handed ammunition to Hewlett Packard before its $5 billion showdown in London next year with Hussain and Mike Lynch, the co-founder and former chief executive of Autonomy once hailed as Britain's leading technology entrepreneur.</p>
      <p>Autonomy, founded in Cambridge in 1996, was Britain's largest software developer. Mr Lynch honed techniques he had developed at the University of Cambridge to create software capable of crunching large pools of data for businesses. The Essex-born businessman would go on to advise David Cameron and sit on the BBC board.</p>
      <p>Autonomy caught the eye of HP, the American software group, which bought the company for $11.7 billion in 2011. Mr Lynch made £500 million from the sale and Hussain £10 million. Then the market turned against the takeover and Leo Apotheker, HP's chief executive, who was thought to have massively overpaid. Indeed, at a near-80 per cent premium to Autonomy's stock market value, the offer was generous.</p>
      <p>The month after the deal was confirmed, Oracle, another American software company, accused Mr Lynch of telling "whoppers" by denying that earlier he had pitched a sale of Autonomy to Oracle's president. Mr Lynch vehemently denied Oracle's claim.</p>
      <p>By the time that the deal had been sealed in October 2011, Mr Apotheker had been replaced at HP by Meg Whitman, the boss of eBay. Little more than a year later HP wrote off the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, saying that the company had engaged in accounting fraud before the takeover. Autonomy's accounts had caused concern among some in the City long before the HP deal. Tim Steer, a fund manager at Artemis, said in 2012 that he had raised concerns about Autonomy's accounting practices as long ago as 2008. "Red lights were flashing everywhere," he said.</p>
      <p>The Serious Fraud Office opened an investigation into the takeover in 2013, but dropped it two years later, saying that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr Lynch and his executive team. The Financial Reporting Council, the accountancy watchdog, opened an investigation into Autonomy in 2013, which it has yet to close. In 2015 HP filed a $5 billion damages claim against Mr Lynch and Hussain in the High Court in London, saying that they had fraudulently inflated the value of Autonomy.</p>
      <p>The men denied the allegation and Mr Lynch countersued, accusing HP of a "smear campaign". He said that HP was in "chaos" at the time of the acquisition and that its executives had caused the value of the company to disintegrate because they had "fought amongst themselves like cats in a sack".</p>
      <p>The question that has remained is: who was responsible for the enormous writedown? HP accused Mr Lynch and Hussain of cooking the books to inflate Autonomy's value; the men said that HP had mishandled the acquisition. The same allegations have been flying back and forth for years.</p>
      <p>Now, thanks to an American jury, HP has gained a solid foothold. The verdict was comprehensive: Hussain was convicted on all 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy. Notable, too, was that the SFO and FRC had lent their support to the prosecution.</p>
      <p>The jurors accepted the US Department of Justice's argument that Hussain had falsely inflated Autonomy's revenues for at least two years before the sale, using backdated contracts and other forms of accounting fraud to make the company appear as if it was growing, when it was not.</p>
      <p>John Bennett, a special agent at the FBI, described the verdict as "a massive victory for the victim company, our community and for the American people".</p>
      <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which was formed after the break-up of HP, said: "Hussain engaged in outright fraud and deliberately misled the market."</p>
      <p>Hussain will appeal against the verdict, which came after a two-month trial. His lawyer, John Keker, said that Hussain had "defrauded no one and acted at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence".</p>
      <p>Mr Keker, who also represented the disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong, said that one of the grounds of Hussain's appeal would be defence evidence of HP's conduct in the year after the acquisition, which was excluded from the trial.</p>
      <p>A hearing scheduled for Friday will determine bail conditions and sentencing arrangements for Hussain. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for each of the 15 wire fraud and securities fraud counts and 25 years for conspiracy. He also faces a fine of $250,000 for each of the 16 counts.</p>
      <p>HP's civil claim at the High Court in London is expected to go to trial in summer next year.</p>

    <text>
      <p>Come with me to carbon-neutral Britain in 2050. We will walk there, as we often do these days, or travel by state-subsidised electric bike. Let's start in the city. It's less smelly, isn't it? And much quieter, save for the birdsong. We can breathe easier. The rare cars on the roads are all electric; there are fewer roads but many more broad, sweeping cycle lanes and pedestrianised thoroughfares that were once jammed with cars. The roads are thickly lined with trees to provide shade and suck up CO2, but it is still far hotter than it was back in 2020.</p>
      <p>The housing is www.different.No new high rises but many medium density, wood-framed buildings, heated by hydrogen pumps, with their rooftop farms, shutters to keep out the summer heat from a warmed world and vertical gardens on every wall. There are water fountains on hundreds of street corners. Nigel Farage, still going at 86, is holding yet another rally in support of petrol cars and meat: the Great British Bangers Defence League.</p>
      <p>Night is falling, and the streets are lit by the ghostly blue glow of a million electric charging points. An autonomously driven bus glides by on hydrogen power with barely a whisper. You can hear the gentle bleating from the city farms.</p>
      <p>As we head into the country (by electric train), the fields are fewer and the hedges and woodland are sprawling. In just 30 years, more than a billion trees have been planted. We have more forest than at any time since the Middle Ages and rewilding is now a natural fact. "What's that, son? That's a cow. Being eaten by a wolf."</p>
      <p>The wildlife is breeding, well, like rabbits. There is just as much roadkill, because though there are far fewer cars, the deer, pheasant, boar and squirrels don't hear them coming. But they are delicious, a fine (if slightly gritty) protein replacement for the farmed meat that is disappearing from the national diet. Looking out to sea from the coast, in the distance is another, manmade, forest: the great army of offshore wind turbines stretching out to the horizon, rotating in unison, except for the one that always isn't. An antique petrol car passes, one of the very few still on the road, and you know that for every burp of greenhouse gas it eructs into the air, an equivalent quantity of CO2 is being stored, far out at sea, in the craters left over from the defunct oil industry.</p>
      <p>This is a futuristic vision, of course. It may be partly a dream. It is going to be fantastically expensive and intensely controversial as a new, legally enforced way of living conflicts with ingrained habits. Britain will not go green fast, or all at once. Some elements of this future may never come to pass. But they are all contained in the government's greenprint for reducing carbon emissions, and they are coming our way.</p>
      <p>Britain has given a legal pledge to become a carbonthe neutral country, cutting greenhouse gases to net zero, in the next 30 years. If achieved, it will be one of the swiftest and most radical transformations in human history. Some impacts will be huge, others barely perceptible. But it will touch almost every aspect of our lives. The first Industrial Revolution in Britain was powered by coal. This green Industrial Revolution promises, in many ways, to be even more disruptive and life-transforming than the first. Energy production and consumption will change utterly over the next 30 years, and with it our homes, health, transport, diet, motoring, manufacturing, landscape, work, leisure, oceans and air.</p>
      <p>"It will be an electrified future and there will certainly be behavioural change," says Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change that advises the government. "We will fly less, change our diets, adapt. It will be a more forested Britain. We will be enjoying nature more. We will not want to travel as much to meet others because we are happy to speak on Zoom." Assuming it works better then.</p>
      <p>This week the government's "Green Deal" promised that the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will cease from 2030. Gas boilers will be banned in all new homes within three years, to be replaced by low-carbon systems such as electric heat pumps. These measures are only the tip of a very large iceberg of changes that will, if they work, slow the melting of the icebergs.</p>
      <p>Transport is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in Britain.</p>
      <p>How we move people and products is the area of life most likely to be dramatically transformed. Before the pandemic, 37 per cent of trips in London were by car or motorcycle, 36 per cent by public transport and 2.6 per cent by bicycle (the rest were walked or described as "other"). The ratios between fuelled and human-powered transport will, broadly speaking, invert.</p>
      <p>Even if all cars were low-emission, in order to reach net zero by 2050 the number of miles driven by car in the capital would have to fall by 60 per cent in 15 years. The remaining vehicles would be electric, or powered by other means, which in turn means that electric charging points will become as ubiquitous as lampposts, and mostly installed in lampposts. Today, there are 30,000 charge points across the country in 11,000 locations. A report by the consultancy Capital Economics last year concluded that 25 million electric vehicle charging points would be required at homes and in public places to meet the target. But electric cars are expensive, and may become more so if grants for green cars peter out. Self-driving could become the preserve of the rich.</p>
      <p>Professor Lord Stern, chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, predicts that by 2050 the distinction between public and private transport will have blurred. "We will be moving around in vehicles that are autonomous, electric and controlled through a system and not narrowly controlled by us."</p>
      <p>Cycling infrastructure will roll out across the country, transforming the cityscape and infuriating traditional motorists. In 2016 Britons made 800 million bike journeys. By 2025 that number is expected to rise to 1.6 billion. Not cycling may become as socially and environmentally unacceptable as refusing to recycle.</p>
      <p>Low-carbon rail travel is likely to replace much of the air travel we have long taken for granted. Last year the aviation industry pumped out 36 million tonnes of CO2. In February, even before air travel slumped with the pandemic, the sector promised to become carbon neutral by 2050, using sustainable and synthetic jet fuels, improving technology, plotting greener flight paths and offsetting by reforestation or planting peat bogs that absorb CO2. Lord Stern believes that while air travel may dip over the next decade, it will resume, but carbon-free. "People want to travel and will continue to do so. But by 2050 we will have synthetic zero-carbon fuels. Then it's a question of managing tourism. There is not much room in Machu Picchu or Venice, but the great outdoors could get better ... and we will have countryside that is much more attractive."</p>
      <p>Houses will become smaller, warmer, better insulated and quieter, as heat pumps and hydrogen boilers replace the gas and oil variety. They will be built of sustainable materials. There will be fewer high-rises with their steel skeletons. In 30 years, the carbon-consuming daily commuter will be a rarer human. Far more people will work from home, using less paper.</p>
      <p>Yolande Barnes, professor of real estate at University College London, predicts that the future will still be urban, but more community-based: "The sustainable urban neighbourhood of 2050 will be one in which you can live, work, play, stay, make, shop and visit. After this next Industrial Revolution the digital city will look more like the pre-industrial city. Multi-use, digitally connected local hubs, which accommodate every aspect of human life, will replace monolithic, homogenous, single-use buildings, blocks and zones." The countryside will feel, and look, very different.</p>
      <p>Livestock production is carbon-intensive, producing 15 per cent of global greenhouse gases. The Committee on Climate Change estimates that a drop of only 20 per cent in consumption of beef, lamb and dairy products would cut eight million tonnes of CO2 by 2050. "It may be that by 2050 we will be in a world in which meat has been replaced by lab-grown meat," says Mr Stark.</p>
      <p>Energy Systems Catapult, which has been set up to transform the national energy system, estimates that meat-eating will need to halve to meet the target.</p>
      <p>Researchers at Oxford calculate that cutting meat and dairy from an individual's diet can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 73 per cent. If the world stopped consuming these things, then global farmland would reduce by 75 per cent, equivalent to the landmass of China, the US, Australia and the EU combined.</p>
      <p>Changing diet will be far harder for humanity than changing the boiler, and the steak of Old England will not be lightly surrendered. But CO2-absorbing British oaks will gradually replace methane-belching British beef. By 2050 a fifth of British farmland - 15 per cent of all land - will have been converted to tree planting and growing biofuel crops, with new forests spreading at a rate of 267 acres a day.</p>
      <p>The seascape will also be transformed. The government wants offshore wind to produce 40 gigawatts by 2030, which would require installing an average of one turbine every weekday for the next decade. Around parts of Britain, sailing will more closely resemble a slalom. But many of these offshore windfarms will be far out at sea, where the wind is strongest, on floating platforms. "That's good for power generation," says Mr Stark, "but also good for dolphins and porpoises closer to land."</p>
      <p>We will live longer, healthier lives, with less meat and more vegetables on our plates, cleaner air, walking and cycling instead of travelling by car or bus. We will be thinner, leaner and more active. The NHS will have to deal with fewer cases of respiratory and heart disease, and more electric scooter injuries and walkers mauled by the thriving lynx population.</p>
      <p>Mr Stark predicts "massive changes in employment", adding: "There will be people making batteries, loft insulation, hydrogen boilers. The new economy will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. But there will also be job losses, in the oil and gas industries and elsewhere." There will be fewer garage mechanics in 30 years and more turbine manufacturers; more foresters and fewer shepherds. That airline pilot may be a vertical gardener; he just doesn't know it yet.</p>
      <p>The changes may even alter the way we think and interact with each other. A greener-thanthou form of snobbery is already emerging and will increase. Once it was a sign of wealth and privilege to pollute. Now the person with the oil-fired boiler, the petrol car and the heavy meateating habit is likely to find themselves an object of opprobrium. We may check one another's recycling bins and minutely measure each other's carbon footprints. We may twitch our net curtains and observe: "Oh, I see Number 14 is flying off again."</p>
      <p>"People may become more judgmental," says Mr Stark. Already, some of the cyclists hurtling around park perimeters or riding four abreast on narrow lanes bark furiously at pedestrians and motorists not just out of frustration, but with the absolute moral authority that car-drivers once assumed.</p>
      <p>One of the more radical visions of the future is the consumption of energy on a subscription, Netflix-style model, in which a single energy provider, for a flat fee, provides transport, heating, lighting, wherever we are, on demand. The bill for lighting your house may also be the bill for charging your car, or your driverless taxi. Uber is buying up real estate near London Tube stations to install charging points, so travellers can emerge from the Underground to charge up and set off by whatever electric mode suits. "Many people probably won't own their own cars," says Mr Stark. For Lord Stern, the shift to carbon neutrality is based on the "power to anticipate", not merely a reaction to change or events. "We are heading for trouble and we have to do something. We are looking ahead. It's deeper than evolution. I hope we tackle it in a way that builds on the human willingness to collaborate."</p>
      <p>Many of the changes will have to be implemented in the next ten years, which will depend on decisions taken in the next three or four. The societal changes of the 1940s were triggered by war; the transformation of the next 30 years will be powered not by experience but by anticipation, a collective realisation of what will happen if we do not act. "We are at one of those extraordinary moments in history," says Lord Stern. "I am totally optimistic about what we could do, and extremely worried about what we might do."</p>
      <p>One of the striking aspects of the brave new green world of 2050 is how closely it may resemble an older, more traditional British society, in which motorised vehicles were few, the air cleaner and travel was rarer and perhaps more prized. Before the first Industrial Revolution we stayed at home more, burnt wood in our hearths behind shuttered windows, ate locally produced food or grew our own, and meat was an occasional treat. We listened to the birds singing as we walked to work, lived in harmony with the natural world and did not attempt to wring every penny of profit from the land. The urge to rush around was a post-industrial phenomenon; we may rediscover the joys of staying still. When a car passes, we may once again try to peer inside to see which rich person might be driving it. A vapour trail in the sky may once more be a rarity, to be pointed out with awe.</p>
      <p>It all feels very new, this government-mandated greenery. But in reality it may be a return to ways of life buried deep in our collective consciousness, a world our ancestors knew.</p>
      <p>Welcome to 2050. Welcome back.</p>
      <p>This green Industrial Revolution promises, in many ways, to be even more disruptive and life-transforming than the first "</p>
      <p>The amount of land covered by forest could return to levels not seen since the Middle Ages, while electric cars, charging points and solar farms, below left, will soar in number over the next three decades</p>

      <title>Smoked pigeon and fry-ups? Yes, I'd love to eat like a caveman</title>
      <subtitle>In the past 60 years our diet has changed more than in the previous 10,000. Should we eat more like our ancestors? Robert Crampton visits London's first Paleo restaurant, where protein is king</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Picture, if you will, the following scene. The date: 10,000 BC. The place: a cave somewhere in what will one day, far in the future, become England. The event: family dinnertime on a dank late-autumn evening, the walls of the cave illuminated by the light of a roaring fire. The participants: an assortment of children, a few mangy pets, a mum, a dad. Perhaps the mum looks not entirely unlike Raquel Welch in her career-defining doe-skin bikini. Perhaps the dad looks not entirely unlike the chap writing this article.</p>
      <p>"Hey babe," the dad says to Raquel.</p>
      <p>"I don't suppose there's any chance of another portion of your delicious gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free, additive-free, sticky toffee pudding?" "Sure thing," Raquel replies. "After all, I have no doubt that in about another 12 millennia what we refer to as the Paleo Diet, but will unfortunately colloquially come to be called the Caveman Diet will - apparent improvements in nutrition notwithstanding - be quite the rage. Knock yourself out, darling."</p>
      <p>And so forth. Satirising the currently fashionable Paleo Diet is not difficult. That should not suggest, however, that such mockery is justified. As I have discovered over the past week, going Paleo - while an admittedly complicated and time-consuming project - feels neither absurd nor weird. Quite the opposite: the restrictions actually start to emerge as both commonsensical and correct. Not to mention healthy. Bottom line: after seven days adhering (more or less) to the guidelines, I'm carrying less stress, less anxiety and - most importantly - less weight. Not much less weight perhaps - I've got a fair bit to play with - but still a significant amount.</p>
      <p>And it's only been seven days.</p>
      <p>My brief was to adopt a Paleo regime for a week. To assist me in this endeavour I was invited to Pure Taste in Notting Hill, London, which is Britain's first Paleo restaurant. Arriving there, I am greeted by Adib Bamieh, the operations manager and co-owner.</p>
      <p>I glance at the menu while Bamieh says he has chosen two starters for me to try, the mussels and the pigeon. Then the salmon and the venison as a main. Then a posset, a tart and the aforementioned sticky toffee pudding to finish. "Bring it on," I tell him.</p>
      <p>I'm no gourmet, so suffice to say the whole ensuing shebang is delicious. Pure Taste opened this week. Bookings are already looking www.good.No one, I confidently predict, will be disappointed. Still, I want to know what this whole Paleo business is all about.</p>
      <p>Bamieh is on hand to explain. "It means you don't eat processed food. You only eat food the human body can digest easily. The caveman thing is for ease of reference, the main point being that if it was available 10,000 years ago our bodies have evolved to eat it. In the past 60 years our diets have changed more than in those previous 10,000 years. What we eat has become very grain-heavy." Grains, I learn, are the main no-no for Paleo people. Why? Because of their chief constituent, gluten. For Paleos, gluten is the devil's work. "No human being on Earth," says Bamieh, "was born with the enzyme to digest gluten.</p>
      <p>Grains are essentially not for human consumption." And just to be clear, by grains we're talking wheat, barley, oats, hops and - especially - corn.</p>
      <p>The starters arrive. Mussels in a Thai coconut broth, plus smoked wood pigeon with pickled vegetables, plus grain-free, gluten-free bread. Down the hatch they all www.go.No problem. Yum-yum.</p>
      <p>Bamieh comes back. "I'd actually been Paleo for five years without knowing it. I had a problem with my stomach and my nutritionist said cut out gluten and sugar for six months. So I did. I felt so much better. You should try it. Give it seven days, see how you feel." That's what I intend, I said, but I'm not sure how to go about it. "Every meal should contain protein," Bamieh advises. "One of the healthiest things you can eat in this country is an English fry-up." Excellent news, I say. But what about porridge instead? Everyone always says that's the ideal breakfast. "No. The body can't digest it properly."</p>
      <p>Here comes the main course. Or courses, I should say. Wild venison from Devon with jerusalem artichoke, all on a bed of shredded brussels sprouts. And also salmon with cauliflower rice and agar jelly caviar. With pomegranate.</p>
      <p>This is all marvellous, I assure Bamieh, but where are my carbs coming from? "Carrots. Courgettes. Sweet potatoes ..." And what about sugar? Surely 10,000 years ago people had at least some sugar? "Yes, they did," he agrees. "You need glucose to function. If you're starved of glucose you slip into a coma, like type 1 diabetics, but sugar was only available in the wild if you could find it."</p>
      <p>He cites blueberries and apples as foods that have historically provided some sugar, but not too much, and then only seasonally. "Refined sugar is what the body can't handle. It converts it immediately into sub-dermal fat. It also causes insulin spikes." In this regard, he says, the real villain of the piece in the modern diet is corn syrup. "It's cheap. It's in a majority of food produce in the shops. It triggers a gorge function in the brain." Bamieh tells me that since going Paleo his waist size has shrunk from a 32 to a 28 "without even trying".</p>
      <p>As someone for whom a 32in waist is a long-lost memory, I want to know more. Holly Redman, 30, the restaurant founder and head chef, is on hand. As we talk I set about demolishing not one, not two, but three of her superb puddings. If I ate like this all the time, I ask, would I lose weight? "Probably not if you had three puddings with each meal," she says, "but the fact is: protein, veg and natural fats are very satiating. Paleo is not about restricting how much you eat."</p>
      <p>As a chemistry graduate from Sussex University, Redman knows what she's about. "I always wanted to work with food and bodies; the chemistry of everyday life," she says.</p>
      <p>Having by trial and error adopted a Paleo Diet to address her own health issues, she now wants to spread the word. "The past 60 years of food industrialisation has given the gut a very difficult job. Chemicals get through the stomach barrier that the body does not recognise as food, so it attacks them as foreign bodies. That's how intolerance reactions start. Going Paleo is a great way to reset your body."</p>
      <p>I have to say I find Redman and Bamieh's arguments pretty convincing - partly because both are palpably sane and rational people, partly because both (unlike many people on specialist diets) look exceptionally healthy and partly because the quality of the cuisine they put in front of me was exceptionally good.</p>
      <p>If ever any proof existed that (conventional) pasta, (normal) bread and (bog-standard, white) spuds can be removed from your intake without the world coming to an end, Pure Taste's offering is it.

      <title>IS THIS THE BRAINIEST MAN ON</title>
      <subtitle>Top neuroscientist, respected academic, pioneering app designer, bestselling novelist, groundbreaking inventor, radical thinker, part-time model - no wonder everyone wants a piece of David Eagleman. By Giles Whittell</subtitle>

    <text>
      <p>he asp caterpillar is small, furry and almost cuddly-looking, but one sting can cause intense pain and a livid rash. It can leave you in shock and respiratory distress and swelling at the lymph nodes.</p>
      <p>TIn 2003, such a caterpillar stung the writer and neuroscientist David Eagleman. "I actually got a really big dose of the toxin," he says at a coffee shop in the medical school where he teaches in Texas. He was 32 at the time and far from frail. Even so, he was laid low for a couple of days. He winces at the memory, but the pain is not the reason he's telling the story. He's telling it because, while recuperating, he got on his computer and created a website. At the top of the home page he typed a question: "Have you been envenomated by the asp caterpillar?" Then he uploaded all the information that he had on it and asked for more data from others who had been stung. When? Where? Symptoms? Recovery time? "Ba, ba, ba, ba, bap," he says.</p>
      <p>Dozens of fellow asp victims emailed back, and he used their case reports to create an annotated map of asp bites, their peak seasons and their effects, across America. Eagleman pauses as the speed of it sinks in all over again. "I thought, 'This is a really good way to go.'" Eagleman likes to get things done. He likes big data and big results. In the 12 years since his caterpillar bite he has become that rare thing in science: a brand name before he's even won a Nobel prize. His day job, at 44, is professor of neuroscience at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, but he is also a latter-day Thomas Edison of the brain. He has stunned Silicon Valley with a device that lets the deaf learn to hear (it's not a hearing aid). He's been granted a patent for a gadget the size of a pack of cards that helps to diagnose schizophrenia and could even point the way to a cure. He has produced apps for American football coaches to check for concussion and for traffic cops to check for intoxication, and along the way he is seeking an answer to the hardest question in neuroscience, namely, "What is consciousness?" A lot of other neuroscientists are asking the same question. Unlike many of them, Eagleman prefers the internet and the database to the scalpel and the microscope. And unlike most of them, he studies the brains of people rather than small animals. He is the quintessential brainiac.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I'm interested in is how human brains work," he says. "Animals' brains can tell us a lot but, fundamentally, we're running different software to rats, and rats aren't building civilisations the way humans are. I'm not interested in rats."</p>
      <p>He is ambitious, impatient, charming and prodigiously clever, and you don't have to be a neuroscientist to come to this conclusion.</p>
      <p>Eagleman's first book of fiction, a dreamy cascade of fantasies about the afterlife called Sum, was a runaway bestseller translated into 27 languages and set to music for the Royal Opera House. A subsequent book, Why the Net Matters, sets out his case for harnessing big data and the web to do on a mass scale what used to be possible only one brain at a time. His latest book, The Brain, accompanies a six-part series of the same name to be broadcast on both sides of the Atlantic. They will make him the most recognised neuroscientist on the planet, and no one should be surprised if they foster the idea of Eagleman as the Carl Sagan of the space between our ears.</p>
      <p>Some of his peers think he should content himself with that. One who knows him well suggests that he sticks to being a communicator, "because we don't have enough of them". Others say such faint praise is sour grapes. "He's a brilliant showman but I think he's also a genuinely brilliant scientist," says Professor Donald Hoffman of the University of California at Irvine, who has seen the Eagleman phenomenon up close.</p>
      <p>In March this year, Hoffman gave a TED talk in Vancouver on the nature of consciousness, having watched the previous speaker from the wings. That speaker was Eagleman, who took to the stage in jeans and a dark shirt fastened with poppers. He began by explaining that the brain, as currently configured, perceives and converts into what we think of as images only a ten-trillionth of the electromagnetic spectrum. But that's not the brain's fault. Its limited sampling is not necessarily a reflection of its capacity. It does what it can given the data thrown at it and its encasement in a dark skull. He introduced the audience to the idea of the brain as a generalpurpose computational device. "And that," he suggested, "frees up Mother Nature to tinker around with different sorts of input channels."</p>
      <p>He spoke slowly, with half a smile, and looked a little bulked up. It turns out that he likes to lift weights, but there was something else going on. Halfway through the 18-minute talk, he ripped off his shirt. Underneath he was wearing a white vest that fitted snugly but had some body to it, like a newfangled buoyancy aid. He turned round and kept talking to reveal his words being translated into vibrations transmitted to his back by dozens of tiny motors like those that make a mobile phone buzz, all enmeshed in the vest.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of the demonstration Eagleman had added flashing lights, but the vibrations were what mattered. They were carrying auditory signals from his larynx, converted into spatial patterns on his skin that his almost infinitely adaptable brain could learn to recognise as sounds. That was the theory. Could it work in practice? He showed a short video of a research subject, deaf from birth, "hearing" words through the vest and writing them on a whiteboard after only a few hours' practice. Cue spontaneous applause. Eagleman looked pleased, but what really gratified him is what happened next.</p>
      <p>In the audience that day were representatives of half a dozen West Coast venture-capital firms. All were keen to invest in the vest. Eagleman chose one and signed a development deal. "So we're going to be able to build these vests, like, lots of them. We can test a whole ton of people, because we'll have the money to hire the people to design the wearables. I've spent 200 hours writing up grant applications for the vest, which get rejected for completely inane reasons. But I give an 18-minute talk, people realise this is a big deal and we're off to the races."</p>
      <p>I ask how much a vest will cost. Eagleman reckons about $500 (£320) - the price of a new smartphone - compared with $40,000 (£26,000) for a cochlear implant that requires invasive brain surgery.</p>
      <p>"Yeah," Eagleman says. "This changes everything."</p>
      <p>There is a sense of frenzied preparation in the lab that bears his name. It occupies about 600sq ft at the heart of the Baylor College building. The college is itself embedded in the giant Houston Medical Center, where gravely ill people come to try their luck with some of the best and most expensive healthcare on the planet. (Dozens are billeted in my hotel, which has a free shuttle service to the giant MD Anderson Cancer Center. I feel lucky to be getting off at a different stop.) The place is cramped. A quarter of it is taken up by his office, which is the only enclosed space and has notes scrawled in felt-tip pen all over its walls.</p>
      <p>Eagleman, when we meet, is stretched thin. It's a Friday. His publisher is expecting an 80,000-word manuscript by Monday. In addition to pushing ahead with large-scale trials of the hearing vest, he has the responsibility of running the lab. That means juggling at least half a dozen other research projects, including one on the neurological components of free will, another on what empathy looks like in an fMRI scanner (functional magnetic resonance imaging), and one based on a colossal inventory of tens of millions of legal records, organised into a database with help from a Californian billionaire, that looks at how a better understanding of inmates' mental health might lead to more appropriate sentencing and fewer overcrowded prisons.</p>
      <p>He has three other half-formed books stacked up in his head. He has a three-and-ahalf-year-old son, and a baby daughter due any day, or at least his wife does. He has not had a holiday in five years. "It's an insane schedule," he admits. "Although if my daughter is born between now and Monday, I'm just going to tell everybody that they have to go away for a few days." So much for paternity leave.</p>
      <p>As we walk quickly down one of the long corridors that link Eagleman's lab to the outside world, he says he worries about burnout. His mother tells me on the phone from home in Albuquerque that their conversations often start with him telling her he's not getting enough sleep. Still, he's in good shape for his age. He wears black T-shirts, designer jeans and biker boots. He drives a red Jeep. In the vernacular of Zoolander, he is ridiculously good-looking. If burnout happens, it will happen in style.</p>
      <p>The corridor leads to a room with a million-dollar device that Eagleman wants me to see. From the Nineties until about five years ago, if there was one type of machine to thank for the surge of interest in neuroscience it was this, the fMRI. It's a giant ring into which the patient's head slides like dough into an oven. It looks and functions like a conventional MRI machine but it produces moving images, not snapshots. It can trace brain function with a time lag of about half a second, by showing oxygen-rich blood flowing to parts of the brain where energy levels have just been depleted through the act of thinking. That time lag can be a problem, but nothing else out there can show brain activity in motion.</p>
      <p>An fMRI machine can show drug addicts the furious activity spikes inside their own brains as they feel a craving for crack. It can show the neurological pile-up that makes some people experience the sound of certain words as tastes. It represents the state of the art of one-brain-at-a-time research.</p>
      <p>Back in the lab, Eagleman shows me the device that represents the state of the art of research on hundreds of brains at a time. It costs about £320, and it's called an iPad. In fact, any tablet will do. Loaded onto Eagleman's is an app that his team has offered free to high-school sports coaches to help them establish whether an athlete is concussed. It works like an easy video game (no experience needed) and checks 12 aspects of brain function in 5 minutes to give a standardised result right there on the touchline. A slightly different version is being offered to police forces to test for "mild cognitive impairment" - which could mean drunkenness, but also driving while high. As Eagleman points out, there's no breathalyser for drugs.</p>
      <p>For research purposes, every result is anonymised and fed into Eagleman's ever expanding databases. As the sample size grows, the correlations between specific types of injury and impairment and specific types of brain function - or lack of it - get clearer.</p>
      <p>Can brains be repaired so they stop breaking the law? Should judges take account of brain damage? What happens to responsibility if they do? It was for answers to these sorts of questions that Eagleman enlisted his billionaire friend to finance the sorting of a vast haul of criminal charge sheets obtained through Freedom of Information. The result, he says, is, "the world's largest experiment in human behaviour under different sorts of incentive structures.</p>
      <p>"Say you've been accused of theft under $1,000. We know whether your lawyer is appointed or assigned. We know who the judge is. We know things like your height, weight and shoe size. We know all about the victim, if there is one … And what this gives us is the capacity to do really large-scale data analysis." He slows right down and switches to an auditorium-filling baritone for emphasis: Really. Large. Scale.</p>
      <p>Patterns emerge like Arctic ice-melt trends seen only from space. For example, it turns out that across the whole, huge sample, there is a clear correlation between being born in 1960 and getting in trouble with the law - not just in your teens and twenties, but throughout your life. Is there a neurological explanation? No one knows yet, but at least we know to ask.</p>
      <p>It's this sort of inquisitiveness that puts Eagleman in a category of one. Not that inquisitiveness alone gets you far with the human brain.</p>
      <p>Eagleman had a lesson on the bigness of the brain as a PhD student. The subject of his thesis was an experiment to model on a computer the workings of a small piece of brain tissue. He didn't use just any computer. He used a new supercomputer that all the institutions of the Houston Medical Center had clubbed together to buy. The calculations were so complex that the machine was busy with them for days, and his supervisor had to fend off protests from others demanding to use it. The experiment was a success, qualified only by its small scale: the brain activity Eagleman managed to simulate contained just 60 connections. That amount of brain would have fitted comfortably on a pinhead.</p>
      <p>A cubic centimetre of brain, by contrast, contains more connections than there are stars in the Milky Way. There are 3lb of brain and trillions of connections in the average skull. We are still a fair way away from downloading human consciousness, but Eagleman once told an interviewer that he H i s 'H e a r i n g ' v e s t w i l l c o s t $ 5 0 0. 'y e a H , ' s ay s e a g l e m a n. 't H i s c H a n g e s e v e r y t H i n g ' thought it could be done. Was he joking? Absolutely not, he says. Forget supercomputers. The future is in millions of networked personal computers. If you could link together all the laptops and smartphones in existence, "We'd probably have enough computational power to run a very slow simulation of the human brain."</p>
      <p>David Eagleman's family moved west from New Jersey to New Mexico in 1970, a year before he was born. His older brother was a toddler. His mother was a biology professor. His father was a doctor, yearning for wide open spaces. They bought a home overlooking Albuquerque and filled it with books - so many that they had to be shelved in library-style stacks.</p>
      <p>There was a television, but Carl Sagan's Cosmos is the only thing Eagleman can remember being allowed to watch, and Sagan is the only person it occurred to him to emulate. ("Some parents say, 'Oh, you'll grow up to be president of the United States,' but that was never the aspiration.") Even now he says he cannot watch Cosmos without crying.</p>
      <p>By the time he was seven it was clear that he was unusually bright, says his mother, Cirel Egelman (David changed the spelling of his surname). He'd talk about the brain being in a box, not seeing the outside world - "the kind of stuff that youngsters don't often talk about". And he would wonder aloud if he was really as far ahead of his classmates as it seemed. "I told him if you are, then it's a blessing, but it's also a burden. It might be you that would discover a cure for cancer. If you can do things that other people cannot do, you have a responsibility to do things for the world."</p>
      <p>In 1991, he was 20 and an undergraduate majoring in space physics in Houston. But he was falling out of love with the subject. He realised that for all its glamour and spectacular applications, this was a discipline without solid answers or any real prospect of finding them. Neuroscientists, on the other hand, have the brain cornered. "It's 3lb. It's right here. It's a tractable problem."</p>
      <p>Or so he thought. Twenty-two years later, the basics of human brain function are still opaque. One of the reasons for this lack of progress, Eagleman ventures, is time-wasting. By scientists. The first time we approach the subject, he handles it with extreme caution. We're talking about the hearing vest and its transparent effectiveness. It works, and no one can say it doesn't. Whereas in academia … He restarts the sentence four times and eventually settles for: "It's just part of the culture of academia that things can move slowly, and sometimes that requires a turnover of a generation for new ideas to catch on."</p>
      <p>Later, he throws caution to the wind.</p>
      <p>"OK," he says, dunking bread in his soup at an Italian restaurant across the street from his lab. "I'll make this statement, but it's going to p*** off some of my colleagues. So much of what gets done in science is so boring. People fight these little battles in the literature that just don't matter. They go back and forth, feeling that the more of a debate they have, the more important it must be. In fact, much of the time it's not important at all. If you could fast-forward to the end of the debate, it just wouldn't matter what the answer turns out to be."</p>
      <p>When the intensity of fact-mining in the dark recesses of our heads becomes oppressive, Eagleman writes fiction. Literature has always been his first love, he says. About 15 years ago he started writing vignettes about death and whatever follows death, and the cosmos. They were inspired by science and a pan-galactic curiosity for which he has coined the term "possibilianism". They were impossible to categorise, and shot through with genius. One of them posits a post-life reckoning in which everything you've done is regrouped by category, so that you spend seven straight months having sex and five flipping through magazines on a toilet. In another, you can choose to come back as anything you like, including a horse. The only drawback is that by the time you feel the dreadful limitations of being a horse, it's too late.</p>
      <p>Since its first printing in 2009, Sum has taken on a life of its own, embraced by churches, synagogues and atheists alike as a sort of secular scripture. The only consolation for less gifted writers is that its few pages took him seven years to complete and several more to find a publisher.</p>
      <p>He doesn't write in the lab, or at home. Instead, he will install himself as usual in a corner booth at his local IHOP and stay there for at least eight hours. The International House of Pancakes is a chain that offers no distractions apart from the free wifi and literally endless coffee.</p>
      <p>From there, he will go straight to the gym. When he has time, he works out on a threeday cycle: biceps and back on day one, legs on day two, chest and triceps on day three. When time is short, he doesn't skip the exercise; he crams a full-body workout into each session. He does it for his sanity, he says.</p>
      <p>And for his vanity? "Sure."</p>
      <p>This gets us into a brief discussion of the time he was voted one of Houston's bestdressed men. Was that embarrassing? "No," he says. "I liked it. I'm sure it inspires the rancour of some of my colleagues … But that's fine. I like being fit. It's not just vanity. It's actually a valid aspiration."</p>
      <p>Back at the lab I try on the hearing vest, which tickles as he talks. Why has he opted for a vest over a tongue pad, I ask. His reply sounds genial at the time, but is startling in the transcript: "Because with the tongue, you've got this f***ing thing in your mouth and you can't eat or speak. That's why." A Turkish clothing company has offered to build the technology into its jeans, but the practical implications of so many vibrations so close to the crotch were daunting. For now, Eagleman is sticking with the back.</p>
      <p>He has set up a company with eight staff working full-time to get the vest ready for trial customers. At the same time he is preparing for the next stage of his work on schizophrenia: rolling out his pocketsized diagnostic tool to patients. The idea is that they will use it to measure and recalibrate tiny errors in time perception that Eagleman has shown are a defining feature of their condition.</p>
      <p>Could this be Nobel-worthy? Well, he says matter of factly, "It counts as a fundamental discovery that I made." He ponders the Nobel question a bit longer and mentions Craig Venter, the genetics entrepreneur who won the race to map the human genome. "Whether or not he gets a Nobel prize, everyone can see that the science he did kicked academia's arse."</p>
      <p>Eagleman may soon be moving his whole operation to Silicon Valley. He wants to keep a foothold in academia, but that's no longer enough. He wants to plug his plug-in brain into the giant distributed computational device known as the internet.</p>
      <p>"Where I am now is, I want to build stuff," he says. "I want to build things that work and there's no debate about it. You strap the vest on somebody who's born deaf and they can hear you and tell you what you're saying."</p>
      <p>There have been talks with a well-known net behemoth and a well-known Californian university. The signs are that both are eager to have Eagleman on tap, and who can blame them? As his mum says, there's something magical about the way his mind works. n The Brain: The Story of You by David Eagleman, published by Canongate, is available from the Times Bookshop for £18 (RRP £20), free p&amp;p, on 0845 2712134; www.timesbooks.co.uk 's o m u c h s c i e n c e i s s o b o r i n g .</p>

      <p>Visit the exhibition of illuminated manuscripts currently at the British Library and you'll realise that the lineage of the Western comic strip goes back much farther than Superman (1938), Tintin (1929) - or even Punch (1841). In volumes that date from the 8th century, kings, queens, Bible characters and anthropomorphic animals are drawn with clear, strong lines, bright colours and cartoonish expressions. Image and text are woven together into narratives; in some cases, pages are even divided into panels. All the ingredients of the comic are in place.</p>
      <p>It's fitting, then, that the British artist Tom Gauld chose a biblical theme for his first graphic novel - though his style might be deemed a little too gloomy for the rather ostentatious royal book collection. In Goliath, Gauld reimagines the Old Testament tale of plucky young David, whose slingshot brings the Philistine giant down, ending the battle in the Valley of Elah and giving Israel its future king.</p>
      <p>Gauld's interest is in the loser. His Goliath is a gentle, taciturn loner who prefers admin duty to soldiering, doesn't approve of bear-baiting, and has to be commanded from his desk and into armour to become the Philistines' champion. Sent out into the valley, accompanied by a chatty young shieldbearer, he spends 40 days waiting for a challenger and growing to love the stark landscape - until a boy appears from the mist, carrying a sling.</p>
      <p>Gauld's Goliath is a masterclass in reduction: his characters are slightly fleshed-out stick-men, his dialogue as dry as the desert. "Everyone's talking about you," the shieldbearer tells Goliath: "Did you punch a camel and kill it?" "No." "And you don't eat rocks?" "No." The haunting Middle East terrain is rendered in a few densely crosshatched rocks and one colour: brown. The violence, when it comes, is shocking, brutal, final. In Gauld's hands, a celebration of the Christian underdog becomes a subtle meditation on the power of spin and the absurdity of war.</p>
      <p>Real-life hero-worship is at the centre of Dotter of her Father's Eyes, by the husbandand-wife team Mary and Bryan Talbot. It begins as a memoir of Mary's "cold mad feary" father, a scholar in thrall to the "sounddance" of James Joyce's fiction, but wilfully deaf to his wife and a harsh disciplinarian to his daughter. The story of Joyce's own daughter, Lucia, becomes a counterpoint to Mary's. A talented dancer, Lucia was thwarted by her bickering parents. In her late twenties she was institutionalised.</p>
      <p>She died in 1982, aged 75, in a psychiatric hospital, on Mary's father's birthday; three years later he was dead, too. Elegantly drawn and fluidly told, like Alison Bechdel's graphic memoir, Fun Home, this is a moving take on fathers, daughters and literature.</p>
      <p>In the 1930s, Lucia was treated by Carl Jung, whose relationship with Freud is explored in David Cronenberg's new film, A Dangerous Method. A good companion piece is Wolf Man, a dark, inky, trippy adaptation of Freud's most famous case study, that of a Russian aristocrat who dreams of white wolves in a walnut tree. It's the first in a series of graphic treatments of his writings.A different kind of madness courses through Tale of Sand, a psychedelic, nearwordless western about a square-jawed hero sent on a lunatic quest, adapted from a recently rediscovered screenplay by the Muppets creator, Jim Henson.</p>
      <p>Finally, back to kings, queens and prophets for Hark! A Vagrant by Kate Beaton, a Canadian history graduate who has turned her hand to drawing hilarious comic strips about history and literature. Henry VIII takes his son out monkhunting; Elizabeth I shows off her formidable wingspan; Emily and Charlotte Brontë go "dude-watching" on the moors and St Francis is urged to ditch the birds in favour of a more "tough guy" animal. It's a terrific update of the 1066 and All That model - funny, clever, and sneakily instructive along the way.</p>

      <title>John Snell</title>
      <subtitle>Pioneer of heritage railways who abandoned a career in the law to devote himself to preserving the romantic age of steam</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>As he shovelled coal into the firebox of No 2 Dolgoch, the quaint old engine puffing between Towyn and Abergynolwyn, the young volunteer fireman from New Zealand could hardly have seen that this inaugural journey of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society would mark the birth of Britain's booming heritage railways.</p>
      <p>The date was May 14, 1951 and 60 years later, when John Snell posed on the footplate of the same little locomotive to mark the diamond jubilee of the narrow-gauge Welsh slate line, he could look back over a lifetime on the railways and his crucial role in the rescue and running of some of Britain's most celebrated preserved lines, part of a network of 100 preservation societies carrying millions of passengers over almost 500 miles of track.</p>
      <p>"If it wasn't for a man like Snell, a generation of children now growing up would never have been able to savour the joys and excitement of steam," Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said.</p>
      <p>When British Railways took over the nation's railways in 1947, it left the crumbling Talyllyn out of the nationalised network. After the death of its owner in 1950, a small group of enthusiasts proposed what then seemed a hare-brained scheme to buy the clapped-out line, repair it and operate the old steam engines with volunteers.</p>
      <p>Snell, about to go up to Balliol College, Oxford to read politics, philosophy and economics, had been obsessed with railways since visiting the line as a schoolboy in 1947. He volunteered for the inaugural run, and returned to work as a fireman and driver during his university summer holidays for the next three years. He even took part in the film Railway with a Heart of Gold during the sequence where locomotive No.3 is derailed. The Talyllyn and that incident were the inspiration for the hugely successful 1953 Ealing comedy The Titfield Thunderbolt.</p>
      <p>By then, railways were in Snell's blood. He abandoned plans to become a barrister, and joined London Transport before moving on to British Railways, where he spent much of his professional career. His real interest, however, was the little lines and the growing campaign to save those abandoned after Dr Richard Beeching's reports in the mid-1960s.</p>
      <p>A keen photographer, Snell helped to catalogue the dereliction at the Ffestiniog Railway before it, too, was successfully repaired and reopened in 1954. Six years later, the Bluebell Railway in Sussex became the first former BR line to reopen as a preserved line, and Snell was on hand to offer advice. Tom Rolt, the railway author and saviour of the Talyllyn, called him, "a pioneer who knew first-hand what it was like to run a fledgling enterprise with worn-out assets, practically no money and disinterest from senior railway figures".</p>
      <p>This knowledge was offered in 1969 to the North Norfolk Railway, which was seeking to reopen a section of the former Midland &amp;Great Northern line. Snell chaired the company and the line opened five years later. Indeed, there is barely a preserved railway in which he was not involved. He was a director of the Paignton and Dartmouth Railway from 1992-2008. He bolstered efforts to keep open and revive the nearby Tamar Valley line. In his eighties he helped the Rother Valley Railway to plan a proposed connection of the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway with the main line at Robertsbridge. And as more and more lines opened around the country, he became vice-chairman of the increasingly powerful Heritage Railway Association. He was also an adviser to the Railway Heritage Trust and founder of the Continental Railway Circle.</p>
      <p>A stately, old-school character, phlegmatic, efficient and reserved, he was hardly the typical early rail enthusiast. "Though fresh from school and quite unskilled, in looks, manners and sheer height, he seemed much older than his age," Rolt said. But Snell proved "one of our keenest volunteers" and a "valuable addition" to the line's staff.</p>
      <p>Friends recall Snell as a stickler for doing things properly, a product of the "Enid Blyton" England of the 1950s, who was intolerant of the sloppiness of modern life. "He believed in quality and in doing things the right way," said Harris.</p>
      <p>One line in particular owes its continued existence to Snell. The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway (RH&amp;DR) is Britain's biggest model railway - a 15in-gauge line that runs for 13½ miles along the Kent coast, with engines and rolling stock a third of the size of standard trains. Opened in 1927, the railway was essentially the plaything of two colourful characters - the millionaire racing driver Captain J. E. P. Howey and Henry Greenly, the engineer of miniature railways.</p>
      <p>In its time it has carried everything: freight, troops, schoolchildren, members of the Royal Family, Laurel and Hardy and, during the Second World War, an anti-aircraft train. But by 1972 it was run-down. Snell took over as managing director, remaining in charge for the next 27 years. He renewed the infrastructure, rolling stock and locomotives and turned the little railway into a profitable attraction that today carries 100,000 passengers a year. He chronicled his efforts in One Man's Railway.</p>
      <p>Sir William McAlpine, who bought the RH&amp;DR in 1972, said that he appointed Snell to run it because no one else knew so much about railways or was so passionate about preservation. The little line was on its last legs and might have been sold off for its assets when Sir William persuaded 20 people to form a consortium, put up £5,000 each and take it over. He said Snell's knowledge of the law was invaluable in dealing with any bureaucracy. "His knowledge was encyclopaedic. If I ever wanted to know anything about railways, I would call him up and he would tell me immediately."</p>
      <p>It was all a far cry from Fiji, where John Bernard Snell was born in 1932. He grew up in New Zealand and was sent to Bryanston School in Dorset at the age of 15. Once bitten by the railway bug, he travelled the world filming, taking photographs and writing books, including Jennie, a fictional tale based on numerous Welsh narrow-gauge railways. On retirement from the Romney line, he remained in Dymchurch, where he lived in a bungalow and where he died. He was unmarried.</p>
      <p>John Snell, heritage railway pioneer, was born on January 1, 1932. He died on January 3, 2014, aged 82</p>
      <p>He worked as a fireman and driver during his university holidays</p>

      <title>Vibrant motifs from the old world found new life in Art Deco</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Tomb art led to a craze for all things Egyptian, says Marcus Binney</p>
      <p>Howard Carter's sensational discovery of the tomb of the boy Pharaoh in 1922 sparked an instant craze for all things Egyptian. The amazing hoard of funerary goods extracted from the tomb included chariots, furniture, mummy cases, gold jewellery and the mesmerising gold mask of the Pharaoh himself.</p>
      <p>Egyptian motifs such as lotus flowers, scarabs, hieroglyphics, pylons and pyramids soon covered everything from book bindings to biscuit boxes, while the figure-hugging "mummy wrap" was all the rage in the 1920s.</p>
      <p>Women wore Cleopatra earrings. Designers such as Pierre Emile Legrain produced rich materials such as vellum, shagreen, zebra skin and chromium plating inspired by Ancient Egypt. Smart furniture by Eileen Gray often incorporated Egyptian motifs that were not limited to expensive couture items but extended across a range of mass-produced goods made in pressed metal and Bakelite.</p>
      <p>Egyptian art became one of the founts of Art Deco, which was named after the 1925 International Exhibition of Decorative Arts in Paris. The stepped profile is one of the archetypal Deco shapes found everywhere from uplighters to picture surrounds and even the setbacks on the upper storeys of large blocks of flats.</p>
      <p>Furniture was geometric and angular, made in highly polished wood and veneers.</p>
      <p>Chrome, glass, shiny fabrics and mirrors were used to decorate aeroplanes, cars, cruise liners and skyscrapers.</p>
      <p>Among the most enthusiastic pioneers of the new Egyptian style were the movie moguls. No fewer than 69 cinemas in the Egyptian style have been identified in England and North America. Many have been closed or demolished but an exciting number have been lovingly restored. Capping them all is Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, designed by the architects Meyer &amp; Holler. It is followed by exotics in little-known places such as Peery's Egyptian Theatre in Ogden, Utah, which opened in 1924, and the Egyptian Theatre in DeKalb, Illinois, adorned with lotus buds, palm leaves, falcon wings and golden serpents.</p>
      <p>Egyptian cinemas in London include the gorgeous 1930 Carlton in Essex Road, Islington, by George Coles, which is clad in cream tiles with vivid green-blue vermilion and yellow trim; and the Astoria, in Streatham, designed by Edward Albert Stone, which opened the same year. Inside was a mural of an Egyptian lady bathing in a lotus-filled pool. Another glorious essay in the Egyptian manner is the Hoover factory on Western Avenue, West London, with the sloping walls of a temple Tutankhamun's tomb was filled with stylised imagery and symbolism, some embossed on the walls in shallow gilt relief. An example of this technique is in New York's Chrysler Building, designed by William Van Alen and adorned with eagle hood ornaments, stylised flowers and sunbursts as well as abstract images of cars.</p>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph Building in Fleet Street (1928-31), by Charles Ernest Elcock, has bulging Egyptian columns. Still more impressive is the Carreras Building, on Mornington Crescent, Camden, completed in 1928, with a giant Egyptian colonnade now restored to its full polychrome glory. The Strand Palace Hotel interiors by Oliver Bernard, now in the V&amp;A, made sensational use of angular Egyptian door surrounds created out of translucent moulded glass, chromed steel and mirror glass.</p>
      <p>As International Modern took over from Art Deco, there was no place for such ornament. Yet Egyptian motifs have made repeated comebacks. In London the architect John Outram built a pumping station on the Isle of Dogs in the late 1980s in the manner of a modern Nile temple with polychrome columns and capitals.</p>
      <p>Another tribute to Tutmania is the Egyptian escalator hall at Harrods. William George Mitchell, the designer, says: "I intended the staircase to be a walk-in sculpture, a journey from the Lower Nile to the Upper Nile."</p>
      <p>The question is where Tutankhamun will take us now, as a new generation of architects and designers is dazzled by the intense beauty and colour of the trophies of the boy Pharaoh.</p>

      <title>A masterclass in dodgy dialogue and cliché that brings its own charm</title>
      <subtitle>Jeffrey Archer's latest Clifton Chronicles hero has aspirations of making it to the top of the writing profession on both sides of the Atlantic but, like the author himself, he still has a long way to go, writes Melissa Katsoulis</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>Be Careful What You Wish For Jeffrey Archer</p>
      <p>MACMILLAN £20 PP400</p>
      <p>The problem of reviewing a Jeffrey Archer novel is nicely encapsulated by the story of Alan Coren who was sent a review copy with a note saying that his old friend Archer would love to get a quote for the book jacket.</p>
      <p>Not wishing to lavish praise on a bonkbuster, but not wanting to disappoint his old pal, all Coren could find to say was: "Fans of Jeffrey Archer will not be disappointed."</p>
      <p>Well, it is not only fans of Archer who will be amazed by Be Careful What You Wish For, the latest instalment in his Clifton Chronicles series. After 400 pages of dodgy dialogue, screaming stereotypes, telenovela melodrama and transparent revisionist autobiography, any sentient being would be awestruck.</p>
      <p>There's no way a man as publicly picked over as Archer cannot know what he's doing, so it seems he has decided to make cliché an art form, in which he faces off his detractors with cunning phrases such as "blood is thicker than water", "an eye for an eye" and "leopards don't change their spots" (that last one is actually prefixed by "forgive the cliché but ..."); then there are the glorious mixed metaphors such as "taking the moral high road".</p>
      <p>Archer even puts himself in the book, in the form of Harry Clifton, a writer of proudly non-literary fiction who "still hoped to join that select group of British writers who'd made it to the top on both sides of the Atlantic".</p>
      <p>This Clifton represents the latest in a long line of Cliftons who fans of Archer will know well. Like all this author's favourite heroes, the Cliftons are selfmade, having grafted their way up from Bristol dockworkers to become captains of industry, joining up with the posh Barrington family who run a successful shipping firm just as the vogue for luxury cruise liners (the sort with libraries filled with Jeffrey Archer novels) is taking off.</p>
      <p>His pride and joy is his elegant, clever wife Emma (a thinly veiled Mrs Archer, as the author confessed in a Times interview), who sits on the board of Barringtons and manages to charm everyone from grubby insider dealers to visiting royals. Emma has her work cut out when the firm is threatened by an unscrupulous businessman "who, because he's got a bit of money and lives in Eaton Square, thinks he can pass himself off as a gentleman". Add to the mix Nazi war criminals, lots of dashing chaps called Giles and Sebastian tooling around Cambridgeshire in MGs and some hefty dropping of names such as Rothschild, and you have a perfect picture of Archer's Britain.</p>
      <p>Archer's childish love of poshness evokes nothing so much as an angry Harry Potter. Nice scenery, cliffhangers at every turn and the sort of language that would really impress a ten-year-old.</p>

      <title>The bacteria are going to win in the end</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>There is no more critical issue for the nhs than the current explosion of hospital-acquired infections, but is the government's headlong rush to meet waiting-list targets helping to create a host of killer superbugs?</p>
      <p>Every morning in a cramped office in the microbiology department of University College Hospital London, a group of eminent consultant microbiologists, virologists and highly specialised infection control nurses sit round a table reviewing the daily bug count on their wards. Today's roster includes four people admitted with salmonella caught from an Islington restaurant; a young African man with suspected tuberculosis; and details of a child with HIV who may come for treatment from abroad.</p>
      <p>Consultant microbiologist Peter Wilson confirms that one patient has been confirmed as a carrier of acinetobacter, a bug that he has brought in from another hospital. This causes much sucking of teeth among the cool heads gathered round the table. A fifth of this particular bacteria are now totally resistant to all antibiotics, and while the patient is only a carrier, it is not a bug they want on the wards, where it could infect patients with open wounds. "Once it's in, it lives in the dust for months and months. I could put it on a window pane, come back in a month, and it would still be alive. It's a nasty one. We haven't got it at the moment, but another London hospital has," saysJWilson with reassuring sang-froid. The last time it appeared at UCLH, the floor of the room had to be stripped completely, the walls repainted and the sink removedJbefore it disappeared.</p>
      <p>But of all the unfamiliar bugs with unpronounceable names that crop up in this hour-long meeting, one is mentioned so persistently that perhaps as many as half the patients being discussed by this infection control team have it. MRSA, or Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, is a superbug that until recently was thought to live only in hospitals. Its virulence and resistance to many anti-biotics can turn a short stay on a ward for some minor complaint into a fatal experience. It has become the scourge of the NHS, rapidly replacing waiting lists as the policy issue of the day.</p>
      <p>One in ten of us who are hospitalised will now end up contracting an infection that we didn't have when we were admitted. Some of these will cause minor setbacks - an infected Caesarean wound, for example, or a urinary-tract infection. Others will prove deadly. According to the National Audit Office, an estimated 5,000 people a year in Britain are dying as a result of hospital infections, and treating these illnesses is costing the NHS more than a billion pounds a year. Since it only became mandatory in March this year for hospitals to report MRSA infection rates publicly, just how many of these deaths are caused by this bug is uncertain, but it is by far the most prevalent, and certainly one of the most virulent.</p>
      <p>The microbiologists who work on the front line of infection control are the ones who know the enemy best. At this morning meeting, MRSA is a daily concern. It is now so common that its presence barely raises an eyebrow, although the subject exercises all those present. "Half is brought in and half is acquired here," explains Geoff Ridgway, consultant microbiologist and chairman of the hospital's infection control committee, to a group of medical students. "Are we putting the MRSAs in side rooms?" he asks a colleague. "If they have it in their throats they are isolated," replies the clinical director for infection, Vanya Gant.JIf there are a large number of infected patients they will be put in a ward together. Another patient has recovered from the illness and is occupying a badly needed intensive-care bed, but none of the general wards wants to take him. Even when patients recover - and one in 20 will die - it requires intensive nursing and long recuperation to get them up and running. Understaffed "clean" wards where there are no infections want to avoid MRSA.</p>
      <p>MRSA is a strain of a bug called Staphylococcus Aureus that usually lives harmlessly on the skin or inside the nose of a third of the population. If you are a Staph carrier, undergo surgery and touch your wound, you can end up killing yourself through blood poisoning. In hospitals throughout the world, this already potentially lethal bug has reinvented itself with resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Some people can carry it without becoming infected, but if it enters the blood system it causes septicaemia that can kill within days.</p>
      <p>According to the European Anti-microbial Resistance Surveillance System, 45 per cent of Staphylococcal infections in our hospitals are now confirmed drug-resistant MRSA, making Britain the superbug capital of Europe. Britain also has the misfortune to harbour two of the most virulent strains in the world, MRSA 15 and 16.</p>
      <p>"Until 1993, MRSA was containable," says Peter Wilson who has two decades of experience in infection control. "We'd get an outbreak, we'd descend on the ward, we'd swab all the patients, all the staff, and give topical agents to get rid of it from their skin. We'd stop people being admitted, and it would go away and that was fine. But since 1993 it has been on an exponential rise, and certainly in the past few years it has been there all the time. We have never got rid of it."</p>
      <p>MRSA does not necessarily equate with dirty hospitals. Rates are highest at London teaching hospitals, where the most complicated medical procedures take place and where the sickest patients are housed. UCLH's rates are average. What is unusual about the hospital is its transparency about the problem, and the priority being given to rein it in.</p>
      <p>Although mostly spread on people's hands, it can be airborne, and once it has gained a foothold in a ward, it is very difficult to get rid of. Vanya Gant describes it as "the bugger with wings". "It's as if they can fly, you can have someone locked up and it'll fly up to the door and out of the door and on to someone else," he says. It is a random killer that can be carried on catheters, intravenous lines, in dust or on dirty linen. It can also live on computer keyboards and the earpiece of telephones, but the most contaminated items on the intensive care wards are the pens.</p>
      <p>SDLP peer Lord Fitt knows all about the vagaries of MRSA. In 1996, his wife, Anne, was taken to Chelsea and Westminster hospital to review her asthma treatment. Anne was admitted for three days to test a new drug with fewer side-effects.</p>
      <p>The day before she was due to be released Lord Fitt visited her, and although in good health, she was anxious. "She said there was a woman at the end of the ward who had got some hospital bug, and they seemed very concerned about her. They had screens around the patient. I put my hands to my head and said, 'If there's a bug, Anne, then you're going to get it.'" Within a day she had MRSA in her respiratory system and was transferred to the Brompton hospital.</p>
      <p>"As I walked down the corridor all I could see was 'no admittance' again and again. There were 17 cases in the hospital. People had entered that hospital with chest complaints and had contracted MRSA. When they brought her meals the staff would open the door and throw it in as if she had leprosy; I found it very hard to take." Anne recovered enough to be taken home, but Lord Fitt was told that his wife was so weak that even a common cold could prove fatal. In January 1997, she caught flu, and within a week had died.</p>
      <p>He pulls out a piece of paper in a small plastic folder from his pocket. The handwriting is faint and shaky but it says, "I love you more than my life, no one could have a better man." It was the last thing that his wife ever wrote. "She knew she was going to die," he says. "I carry it round with me always."</p>
      <p>MRSA tends to affect anyone who has a less efficient immune system: the very young - for example, babies in Special Care Baby Units - or transplant and cancer patients. "The places where you get MRSA in any hospital are mainly where the sickest patients are," says Wilson. "Our ITU (Intensive Therapy Unit) is not unusual, the patients are so ill, there are many things being done to them, needles being stuck into them, a lot are having anti-biotics, there are a lot of nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and radiographers. It only needs one person to touch an MRSA positive patient and forget to wash their hands before they go to the next patient, and you have transmitted it."</p>
      <p>Professor Barry Cookson, director of the Laboratory of Hospital Infection at the Central Public Health Laboratory, is a man possessed. He admits to lying awake at night trying to think of ways to persuade healthcare workers that washing their hands saves lives. On his desk are stacked so many bulletins about Hospital Acquired Infections, reports on MRSA figures from around Europe, and documents on infection, that only his head is visible across the desk. From his cupboard at the public health laboratory he pulls out a selection of hand washes for me to try. There are little plastic vials that can be attached to doctors' and nurses' clothes, and hand rubs with varying combinations of alcohol and emollient. Doctors, according to a survey in The Lancet, are more guilty than nurses of sloppy hygiene.</p>
      <p>According to Cookson, and everything he says is backed up by a medical report that he plucks from his bookshelf, if healthcare workers washed their hands before and after they touched each patient, the rate of MRSA in the UK would fall by almost a quarter. It seems such a simple first step in combating this plague, but nothing Cookson and his team have dreamt up has managed to produce results.</p>
      <p>Back at UCLH infection control, nurse Jacqueline Murray-Leonard, who heads the team of five infection-control nurses, is patrolling the wards under her jurisdiction. In the ITU of Middlesex hospital, where four of 18 patients have been isolated with MRSA infections that they have either contracted in other hospitals or caught since they arrived, she is ever-vigilant. The patients are in rooms with signs outside warning people to stay away. All are unconscious.</p>
      <p>She spots a junior doctor wearing a wristwatch and gently suggests that he loses it - wristwatches are a fertile stopping-off point for bugs in transit. She checks that all the containers with alcohol gel to wipe hands are full. One of her first battles as infection control nurse when she came here was to ensure that every bed has one of these beside it. She believes that patients should ask doctors and nurses to wash their hands before they touch them, but says that a trial in the hospital failed because patients felt guilty pressing over-burdened staff to do this. Another nurse calls her over to talk to the wife of a patient just admitted from another hospital where he contracted MRSA. She wants to know whether she can catch it. Jaqueline explains that as long as she washes her hands after visiting her husband, there is no danger of transmission.</p>
      <p>"I think that with the advent of antibiotics, where infection could suddenly be treated with a tablet, it made less and less need for hygienic nursing. People got complacent," she says. "I think we are moving out of the antibiotic era, where any operation could become life-threatening. The bacteria are going to win in the end, they have a need for survival just as we do."</p>
      <p>Walking around this intensive-care unit is like living life in fast-forward, people are rushing from one patient to the next. Sister Therese Parker explains, in between the constant phone calls and beeps, that there are 18 beds on this 15-bed ward, and that they are always full. It is difficult to ask her any questions, she is so obviously under extreme pressure and there are quite simply bigger fish to fry. She says that having just four MRSA patients is unusual,Jsometimes half the ward is infected.</p>
      <p>After a critical report last year, UCLH has improved its standards: this ward is meticulously clean. But unfortunately cleaning up wards is just part of the problem. In the US, studies have shown that if you put 35 beds into a 28-bed ward, you increase your Staphylococcus cross-infection rate by about 30 per cent. "The way healthcare is delivered today is almost designed to encourage the spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms such as MRSA," says Cookson.</p>
      <p>While everyone wants to see waiting lists reduced, the pressure on hospitals to operate on as many patients as possible is a key factor in the huge increase in MRSA over the past few years. This in turn leads to MRSA patients blocking badly needed intensive-care beds and placing further pressure on waiting lists. In early April, all heart operations at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary were suspended after 13 patients contracted MRSA. Patients are also discharged before they have time for MRSA infections to be spotted, thereby carrying the bug back into the community. It is a seem-ingly insoluble conundrum.</p>
      <p>UCLH has more patients than beds, sometimes with four different people using the same bed in one day, a practice known in the NHS as hot-bedding. "One would have thought that the lessons of the past would have been heeded. During the First World War there was a devastating meningitis outbreak, the soldiers' bunks were just a little bit too close together, when they put an extra foot between the bunks the outbreak disappeared," says Gant. "In the context of modern hospitals, where increasingly we are admitting chronically sick people whose resistance to colonisation and infection are much lower, you would have thought that it would make sense to run not at 100 per cent bed occupancy, but maybe at 80 per cent, because then you may be below the critical level at which transmission could happen."</p>
      <p>There are chronic problems with understaffing and reliance on agency staff. These workers sometimes come to cover for just four hours. There is little time to teach them the principles of infection control, and they can carry infections not just into different wards but to other hospitals. Gant says that because of the intense pressure to get patients off trolleys in A&amp;E within four hours so that the hospital retains its two-gold-star rating, people with "dirty" wounds that could be infected with MRSA get sent to a clean orthopaedic ward where patients are recovering from hip replacements. "What do you do? Send them to the clean orthopaedic ward because you can't blow the trolley wait, or do you say we have a clean ward with no MRSA? Right from the chief executive down to the infection control nurses, we are desperately trying to find a solution to these competing priorities. This is a situation where we are doing something because the Government says we should, but it's not necessarily best practice. It is the stress in the system that causes a lot of the hospital-acquired infection problems. The system is running on empty, and a lot of the time we have to run to keep still."</p>
      <p>There is a sense of historical inevitability about this situation. Almost as soon as penicillin was invented in 1940, bugs began to develop resistance. Whenever a resistant strain appeared, the pharmaceutical companies rushed to find an alternative, but within a few years this new wonder drug would prove fallible. A year ago a new antibiotic, Linezolid, was brought out for strains of MRSA that had become resistant to existing antibiotics. However, within a year, Linezolid-resistant strains of MRSA had already appeared in a hospital in Boston. The bacteria that survive each chemical onslaught are ever-stronger than their antecedents, and the places where they really test their muscle are precisely the places where antibiotics are used most - in hospitals.</p>
      <p>In countries where antibiotic use is most prevalent, more MRSA develops. According to Cookson, more than 80 per cent of staphylococcus infections in Japan are MRSA. This is because in Japan the companies that make antibiotics pay a direct sales tax to the government so that the country'sJhealth system is dependent on antibiotic sales. "The Japanese use as many antibiotics as the rest of the world combined," he says.</p>
      <p>More than 80 per cent of antibiotic prescriptions regularly doled out in Britain are completely unnecessary, believes Gant. In taking antibiotics for minor complaints, we are part of the problem, he says. A dose of Amoxycillin, which is regularly prescribed for sore throats, destroys 95 per cent of your gut flora in one day. Gant believes that in hospital, doctors should seriously cut down on their usage because overloading patients with antibiotics makes them more susceptible to infections such as MRSA. They destroy the good bugs, and the ones that remain are the really unpleasant ones which then gain hold in the body. Simply put, if you make conditions less favour-able for MRSA by allowing the good guys to stay, you make a first step in really dealing with the problem. This is radical stuff and unlikely to dent current practice.</p>
      <p>"We have one hundred million organisms living in or on us. We have grown up and evolved from the moment we are born in a state of balance and symbiosis, they know their place, they stay in the gut and on the skin. Some of them keep you alive. What antibiotics do in one fell swoop is completely ruin that balance," he says.</p>
      <p>But these voices need to be heard. For the first time in the United Kingdom, a young boy died of MRSA last year, which he contracted not from a medical establishment but in the community, most likely after cutting his foot in a public swimming pool. If this bug makes this transition, then MRSA will become everyone's problem, not just one for people in hospital.</p>
      <p>UCLH's openness about the extent and problem of MRSA is unusual and commendable. It is in the interests of many people to avoid the problem. Hospitals fear negligence claims, and many have already settled out of court. The Government is anxious to avoid another healthcare scandal or consider that a central plank of its health policy - reducing waiting lists - may be creating a new and more dangerous problem. It is not, however, too late at least to put a brake on this process. In countries where antibiotic prescription has been centralised, such as the Scandinavian countries, problems with MRSA are now under control. In the Sixties, Denmark had the highest MRSA rate in Europe, but through rigorous infection control and restrictive use of antibiotics the problem was reined in. Unfortunately, the NHS as it is, with too many patients and too few doctors and nurses, is a Petri dish for bug transmission.</p>

      <title>Sixteen men on a mission: the India Test squad, summer 2002</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>RAVI SHASTRI, commentator for Channel 4 and former India all-rounder who once hit six sixes in an over, casts his eye over the India touring team challenging England in the four-Test series this summer</p>
      <p>Sourav Ganguly</p>
      <p>Age: 30 LH bat/ R medium</p>
      <p>As captain, the man in charge of improving India's record overseas. Scored a spectacular half-century in the NatWest triangular series final but otherwise has not been in great form. A Test at Lord's, where he made his debut six years ago, is a serious challenge, as captain and player</p>
      <p>Ajit Agarkar</p>
      <p>Age: 24 RH bat/R fast-medium</p>
      <p>Deceptively quick with the ability to swing the ball consistently away from the right-hander. Can be an explosive customer, especially for an unwary batsman. Has some Test experience but vastly more in one-day internationals dating back five years and bringing 154 wickets</p>
      <p>Sanjay Bangar</p>
      <p>Age: 29 RH bat/R medium-fast</p>
      <p>A highly capable batsman, worthy of the all-rounder's label, he is unlikely to figure much in this series unless conditions are right - perhaps at Headingley next month. He has a Test hundred to his credit to reward his status</p>
      <p>as a real team man who also has developed the the ability to swing the ball late Shiv Sunder Das</p>
      <p>Age: 24 RH bat/R medium</p>
      <p>Needs to adapt to overseas conditions. Both his Test hundreds have been in India but his form was not impressive in South Africa or West Indies.</p>
      <p>Has talent as an opening batsman but needs to be consistent to win consideration for Test selection in England. In short, requires runs to persuade</p>
      <p>Rahul Dravid</p>
      <p>Age: 29 RH bat/R off-spin</p>
      <p>Along with Sachin Tendulkar, one of India's batting pillars.</p>
      <p>Playing county cricket for Kent and having a working knowledge of English conditions is a benefit and he has advanced a long way since his early days. One of the most popular and easily recognisable players in his own country</p>
      <p>Wasim Jaffer</p>
      <p>Age: 24 RH bat/R off-spin</p>
      <p>Tall, elegant and enjoying a burgeoning career. Excellent especially off the back foot, he is a wristy strokeplayer with time on his side in every sense.</p>
      <p>Played a couple of vital innings for his country in West Indies last winter. Averaging around 22 in Tests and this tour is a big experience for him</p>
      <p>Zaheer Khan</p>
      <p>Age: 23 RH bat/L fast-medium</p>
      <p>The bowler that could inspire India to take 20 wickets overseas and win a Test match. Industrious and energetic, his aggression has been complemented by improved fitness over the last eight months. His left-arm bowling, much feared by right-hand batsmen, could be a big factor</p>
      <p>Anil Kumble</p>
      <p>Age: 31 RH bat/leg-spin</p>
      <p>His ability to bowl slower in the one-day game and use a devastating loop also allows him to turn the ball even a solitary inch and this ability makes him twice as dangerous. The fact that he is the oldest member of the party means nothing. He is one of the great competitors and a feared bowler</p>
      <p>V V S Laxman</p>
      <p>Age: 27 RH bat/off-spin</p>
      <p>A tremendous talent but does not do justice to it. Needs to be more consistent but might just open the batting sometime during the Test series. Highly competent in what is a congested middle order. India's struggles have been with the openers. Maybe he could do it but more likely to bat at six</p>
      <p>Ashish Nehra</p>
      <p>Age: 23 RH bat/L medium</p>
      <p>A bowler England will have to watch if he hits the spot.</p>
      <p>Well capable of rocking the top order, he has modelled himself on Wasim Akram of Pakistan and makes the ball skid through as well as swinging it late. His fair pace means he is a lot quicker than he sometimes appears. Batsmen beware</p>
      <p>Parthiv Patel</p>
      <p>Age: 17 LH bat/Wicketkeeper</p>
      <p>The youngest member of the party, who has performed admirably against the A teams of South Africa and Sri Lanka. A raw talent, he had played only a few first class games before coming to England but boasts a batting average in the mid-30s. A player to watch, even though he may not figure in this series</p>
      <p>Ajay Ratra</p>
      <p>Age: 20 RH bat/Wicketkeeper</p>
      <p>Has emerged through the under-19s and fulfils the shortfall that India has in the wicketkeeping department. Energetic, youthful, athletic and known as "Bunty", he has emerged at the perfect time and played the first of his four Test matches so far against West Indies last winter</p>
      <p>Virender Sehwag</p>
      <p>Age: 23 RH bat/off-spin</p>
      <p>An extremely exciting strokeplayer pushing for a place in the middle order to the</p>
      <p>extent that he may even be elevated to open the batting. Has a Test average exceeding</p>
      <p>50 but needs more sober strokeplay at that level. Something of a "floater" in the side - could bat anywhere</p>
      <p>Harbhajan Singh</p>
      <p>Age: 22 RH bat/off-spin</p>
      <p>A fierce competitor - especially for a spin bowler. If the sun beats down, it will be touch-and-go between him and Anil Kumble for a Test place. Has added a straight ball to his armoury, making him more difficult to handle. Has a wonderful temperament and is the real character in the squad</p>
      <p>Sachin Tendulkar</p>
      <p>Age: 29 RH bat/leg-spin</p>
      <p>Simply the best batsman in the world, who should go out and play his natural game rather than being burdened with expectation and pressure. Quiet and reserved off the field - despite his iconic status - he is the ultimate team man. There could hardly be a better role model than Sachin Tendulkar</p>
      <p>Tinu Yohannan</p>
      <p>Age: 23 RH bat/R medium-fast</p>
      <p>Loose-limbed and the tallest of India's quick bowlers, he offers a potential threat - more as a purveyor of seam than swing. His goal is to become the next Srinath for his country. He is involved in tough competition for a Test place but has the talent to come through and challenge the more established choices</p>

      <title>Here's my health and safety proposal-the moaners should give it a rest</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>THERE IS somewhere, not far below the surface of our British psyche, a deeply boring paranoid, unthinking little person always wanting a moan.</p>
      <p>Example 1: a few days ago I tune into the radio and hear an item about a remake of the 1954 war movie, The Dam Busters (for those of you too young to remember, The Dam Busters concerns a daring attempt to destroy three German dams from the air during the Second World War). Remarkably quickly this discussion turns to the subject of what the makers of the new film will do about the name of the leading character's dog, which he called Nigger. And right on cue a venerable actor and a studio guest begin to lament the "political correctness" that may mean the dog is rechristened.</p>
      <p>We shouldn't, says one of the discussants, be changing history just to suit modern preoccupations.</p>
      <p>But, seconds later, we discover that the original film made Squadron Leader Guy Gibson (the mission leader) into an OK kind of guy, when it fact he was a complete S H One T, and that it left out one dam because the bombers didn't hit it and that would have made the film anti-climactic.</p>
      <p>So you can change history all you want if it suits the dramatic needs of the film, but you can't change a pooch's monniker to avoid giving huge and unnecessary offence to millions of fellow citizens. That would be political correctness. I suppose we should all thank our favoured deities that the original 101 Dalmatians weren't led by Kike, Yid, Greaseball, Guinea and Spic.</p>
      <p>Example 2: the whining after the long overdue death of the Routemaster bus. We have lost buses before -trolley buses, buses with open decks up top, horsedrawn buses, and perhaps each demise has been greeted with a similar chorus of nostalgic regret. But never, I imagine, with such insensitive stupidity. You can buy a DVD this Christmas called Farewell to the Routemasters, the publicity for which will tell you that this, the "most loved and useful public transport vehicle ever built", was "killed off by a combination of 'health and safety' legislation and political correctness".</p>
      <p>The same message will come to you from the libertarian Left -"The problem with Routemasters is that they are out of keeping with a risk-averse, access-for all world" (Rob Lyons, Spiked Online); the Eurosceptic Conservative Right -"Have you ever wondered why the symbol of Britain the Routemaster bus must go and be replaced by the German-built fire- hazard, the bendy bus? Why? Because it does not fit in with the EU directive that forced upon the UK the Disability Discrimination Act" (Robert Oulds, of the Bruges Group).</p>
      <p>The architectural correspondent at The Guardian writes, unhappily:</p>
      <p>"Accessible, good. Inaccessible, bad. Remember to chant this government- approved mantra as you wait for your rush-hour London bus."</p>
      <p>And Enochwasright, down at the Stormfront happy Nazi website, will remind parteigenossen that the Routemaster is "another part of our tradition &amp; culture that's been destroyed by our communist government".</p>
      <p>Of course at Stormfront, following in the bootsteps of Dr Mengele, they probably have courageous and radical policies for dealing with people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The other complainers, however, seem simply to want wheelchair users and others with impaired mobility to fade away and not to bother us with demands for public transport that they can actually use. When it comes to buses -public transport, you know, transport for the public -if you can't get on them or off them, then they are no bloody use; they fail at the very first test and it has nothing to do with risk-averseness, political correctness, the EU or chanting mantras.</p>
      <p>And it takes nearly no effort of imagination to place yourself in the position of someone with chronic arthritis being asked to haul themselves up on to the platform of a Routemaster.</p>
      <p>The same goes for those who moan about building regulations for new houses that stipulate no big front step, or specify downstairs loos.</p>
      <p>Or those who complain that the building of a few metalled paths in countryside areas to accommodate wheelchairs somehow represents a destruction of all the natural beauty that they have come to see. Down at my local gym there have been complaints about the loss of one of the two massage treatment rooms to accommodate a disabled loo. "But we hardly get any wheelchairs in here," one woman complained to me, without the slightest trace of irony. Not surprising if there's nowhere you can pee, because the alternative is to do it in your pants. Sorry to be graphic, but that's reality.</p>
      <p>Example 3: back to the radio at the end of last week. And the liberal academic Lisa Jardine is giving it large (as David Cameron might say) on Who Really Runs the Country?, and you don't get prizes in this kind of exercise for understating your case. For her it's "health and safety" that not only bosses the nation, but that stops us from doing good stuff that we want to do. Her reason for saying this? She was organising an event and wanted to hang a banner up high, but a jobsworth told her she couldn't because "health and safety" said you needed two men, including one to hold the ladder, and they didn't have two men, so her entire event was going to be ruined. Plucky Lisa waited till he had gone and she put it up herself, proving two things -first, that she embodies the indomitable fighting spirit of the people and second that heath and safety culture has gone mad.</p>
      <p>Well, something had certainly gone mad. In the old days, of course, the man would just have gone up that ladder, fixed everything and everyone would have been happy. In fact in the old days he might well have been obliged to climb that ladder as part of his job. The trouble is that even in the not-so-old days he might well have fallen off. In 2004, before the relevant directive came into force, 13 people died from falling off ladders in British workplaces and more than 1,200 were seriously injured. All Jardine had to do was to plan her banner hanging with sufficient forethought to arrange elementary safety. If she can't even do that, what on earth was she doing chairing the Booker Prize?</p>
      <p>Correspondence on that question to her, please. Instead she whinges about heath and safety.</p>
      <p>Of course I appreciate, as anyone who has filled out a BBC hazard assessment form to visit a museum in York must do, some of the seeming absurdities that local enforcement of regulations can give rise to. It's annoying and I could do without it. But I also want to live in a society where workers aren't forced to do dangerous things, where steel bolts aren't left protruding from the swings in children's playgrounds, where people with disabilities can go to the toilet or get on buses and where the occasional under-regulated slurry tip doesn't descend upon the local primary school.</p>
      <p>Moaning is one thing, doing something about it is another. The pre- Cameronian-era Conservative Party has always fulminated against "excessive" regulation. Just this summer, in a Commons debate, its spokesperson, Angela Browning, asked ministers why the Government persisted in talking about "better regulation". "What we want," she stated, "is less regulation, not better regulation."</p>
      <p>But she didn't tell us which regulations we ought to lose, and she never will. It was William Hague's Disabilities Act of 1995 that signalled the end of the Routemaster. He should be proud of what he did -and I bet he is.</p>

      <title>Dealer in death who disguised himself as a healer in life now faces new age of incarceration</title>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>The mysterious old man with the flowing white beard who exuded spirituality and became a celebrated alternative healer went by the name of Dr Dragan David Dabic. Yesterday he was unmasked as one of the world's most wanted fugitives, living an extraordinary double life in the midst of those seeking him for war crimes.</p>
      <p>Radovan Karadzic may have been lionised in folk songs by Serb nationalists for his ability to avoid capture. Not even his most imaginative supporters would have guessed that he was hiding behind a New Age persona, providing a bio energy boost and "human quantum energy" for clients in a Belgrade suburb.</p>
      <p>Dr Karadzic, 63, the Bosnian Serb leader who had been on the run for nearly 13 years, was in a cell last night preparing to appeal against his extra- dition to The Hague, where he faces 11 charges, including genocide carried out allegedly on his orders.</p>
      <p>His arrest leaves the former General Ratko Mladic, Dr Karadzic's military commander, as the most-wanted Bosnian Serb fugitive. Mr Mladic is widely believed to be hiding in Serbia, probably protected by sections of the Yugoslav military.</p>
      <p>There was astonishment when police revealed the true identity of Dr Dabic, and disbelief among those who had been taken in. The distinctive mane of grey hair had been replaced by a snowy beard and glasses. His landlord had no idea who was renting the nondescript high-rise flat in New Belgrade.</p>
      <p>"It was a brilliant camouflage," said Goran Kojic, the editor-in-chief of a health magazine who knew "Dr Dabic" and published several of his articles on Serbian Orthodox meditation. "He left such a calm impression of a cultured man of great spirituality. He was funny, entertaining and eloquent, the sort of person you wanted as a friend."</p>
      <p>The Serb authorities gave details of the dramatic arrest of Dr Karadzic yesterday, suggesting that they had been following a circle of his supporters for weeks while awaiting their opportun- ity. They said that they simply seized him on a bus on Monday night as he travelled between safe houses.</p>
      <p>Rasim Ljajic, the minister in charge of co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said: "He was very convincing in hiding his identity. He was performing alternative medicine, making money that way."</p>
      <p>Dr Karadzic's undercover life was in an area of the city known for its nationalist sentiment, and he was protected by a group of sympathisers.</p>
      <p>There was no suggestion yesterday that anyone would receive a share of the $5 million put up by the United States for his capture. The Serb authorities denied the involvement of foreign security services.</p>
      <p>The official version of events was immediately challenged by Dr Karadzic's lawyer, who insisted that his client had indeed been seized on a bus but that the seizure had taken place on Friday morning. He was led off by several plainclothes policemen, hooded, and taken to a small room where he was held for three days, Svetozar Vujacic claimed. "He was blindfolded and that is absolutely against the law," he said.</p>
      <p>A judge at a hastily convened war crimes court in the Serbian capital positively identified Dr Karadzic and read him the charges: 11 counts of war crimes, including genocide, for the massacre at Srebrenica and the siege of Sarajevo. His lawyer said that he was likely to lodge an appeal on Friday.</p>
      <p>Dr Karadzic was last seen in public in the eastern Bosnian town of Han Pijesak in July 1996. During his years on the run he developed an extensive network hat gave him funds, shelter and apparent impunity from the law. He was like a murderous Scarlet Pimpernel: some reports claimed that he was supported by Serb Orthodox priests who took him into their monasteries; others that he was backed by organised crime groups flush with the profits of war. He was said to flit between Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro with ease, protected by a posse of heavily armed bodyguards.</p>
      <p>The contrast with Saddam Hussein, found hiding in a hole after eight months on the run, and Dr Karadzic's years of liberty is stark.</p>
      <p>Richard Holbrooke, the US diplomat who brokered the Dayton accords, told The Times: "There was a lack of political will to get Karadzic. Nato could have picked him up easily when his green Mercedes was parked outside his headquarters in Pale. But Nato commanders said they had the authority but not the obligation."</p>
      <p>Those who knew him as Dr Dabic told The Times that he was regarded as an expert in silence and meditation. One of his lectures was called "The relationship between calmness and meditation". He also gave lectures on healthy living. During the most recent, visitors were offered free massages, yoga, t'ai chi and lessons in the Brazilian dance capoeira. His website advertises energy healing and beauty treatments and offers to cure conditions ranging from impotence and other "sexual disturbances" to diabetes, asthma, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis.</p>
      <p>Using the name D.D. David, he promoted his David Wellbeing Programme, based on the use of "human quantum energy". His website says that people are "programmed" to live to between 120 and 130, an age that could be reached by those who had his treatments. Those who visited his lectures told local media that they were "very good" and visited by up to 400 participants at a time.</p>
      <p>Few in Belgrade believe that Dr Karadzic's biblical beard and double life as an alternative medicine practitioner would fool one of the region's most efficient secret services. It is more likely that the Serb Government has long known of his whereabouts but only with the election of a pro-Western administration was there the will to arrest Dr Karadzic.</p>
      <p>European foreign ministers said that the arrest demonstrated "the commitment of the new Government in Belgrade to contribute to peace and stability in the Balkan region" and represented "an important step" bringing Serbia closer to the EU.</p>
      <p>Bernard Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, said: "This changes everything. For 13 years we have waited for this."</p>
      <p>The Netherlands, criticised for the way that its lightly armed peacekeepers stood aside at Srebrenica, said that Serbia must arrest the remaining suspects, Mr Mladic and Goran Hadzic.</p>
      <p>The first sign of the improvement in relations between Brussels and Belgrade could come next week with the implementation of a stabilisation and association agreement, which has been put on hold until Serbia "fully co operates" with The Hague.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Dr Karadzic's daughter, Sonia, banned with other family members from leaving Bosnia over suspicions that they helped him to elude capture, pleaded for the restrictions to be lifted so that she could visit him before his transfer to the Hague. In Sarajevo the authorities said that they had yet to make a decision.</p>

      <title>Five reasons why you cannot afford to ignore tomorrow's Greek vote</title>
      <subtitle>Greece goes to the polls in a rerun election that could result in the country effectively voting itself out of the euro. But how can a nation that contributes only 2 per cent of the European economy threaten to tear apart the EU itself and damage Britain's recovery? Times writers investigate</subtitle>
    </metadata>
    <text>
      <p>1 A disorderly default will hit British banks and businesses</p>
      <p>The Mansion House speeches by the Chancellor and Bank of England Governor were the clearest evidence of how fearful the UK authorities are of the fallout of Greek political collapse. The Bank yesterday activated an emergency programme offering £5 billion a month of liquidity to commercial lenders to help to insulate them from the convulsions that would follow disorderly events in euroland. Tellingly, Sir Mervyn King made the terms much more generous than when the loan facility was drawn up in December. There are also hints of co-ordinated action by the world's central banks after the Greek poll.</p>
      <p>For months British banks have been working with regulators on contingency plans to ensure that they have stress-tested their finances to deal with a Greek departure. Yet if a contagious collapse in confidence spread across the region, affecting large markets such as Spain, Italy and France, some lenders would find themselves in mortal danger again.</p>
      <p>For the UK corporate world, few things could be more damaging than a financial rupture in the EU, their biggest export market. Already hopes for a trade-led recovery are faltering because of the economic woes of euroland. Yesterday official data showed a worrying jump in Britain's trade deficit, in part because of a 6.8 per cent decline in exports to other European countries.</p>
      <p>George Osborne claimed in his Mansion House speech that the Government was capable of rolling up its sleeves and protecting Britain from the euro crisis. But analysis from his own Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) paints a less reassuring picture. A disorderly default by a large eurozone economy could lead to two full years of recession in Britain, with GDP declines of 1.9 per cent in 2012-13 and another 0.2 per cent in 2013-14. Mr Osborne's deficit-reduction plans would be blown out of the water, as the national debt was driven up by an additional £215 billion by 2016-17, the OBR said.</p>
      <p>SAM FLEMING</p>
      <p>2 Chaos in Greece will send a shock through Europe</p>
      <p>Greece accounts for a modest 2 per cent share of Europe's economy, but if the elections result in a departure from the euro it would have a disproportionate impact on the region.</p>
      <p>A euro departure would send a clear signal to nervous investors around the world; the euro was meant to be irreversible, but that notion was false. Anyone could find their euros swapped into another, less valuable currency with no warning.</p>
      <p>Depositors in Spanish, Portuguese or Italian banks could quickly conclude that their euros would be safer in a German bank, leading to bank runs. As the bond giant Pimco said last week, many professional investors have already decided to cut their losses, withdrawing from government bonds in the periphery and refusing to lend money to countries' banking systems amid fears that they could be paid back in a devalued currency. This flight would accelerate dramatically.</p>
      <p>So are we likely to be faced with a sudden Greek exit on Monday morning? That is unlikely. The most probable outcome of the election is that no single party will have a sufficient majority to form a government, making coalition talks necessary. These could drag on for days, destabilising financial markets and potentially forcing the European Central Bank to ease tensions in the banking sector with fresh cash injections.</p>
      <p>Even if the anti-austerity Syriza party wins, its leader Alexis Tsipras will be well aware that 75 per cent of Greeks want to keep the euro. This could force him to undertake talks with the Troika of official lenders to Greece, rather than unilaterally tearing up the terms of the bailout and defaulting on his country's debt.</p>
      <p>The question is whether there is room for a compromise to be reached on the package that allows official support to be continued for Greece and for the country to remain in the euro. Some analysts detect an appetite for compromise in Northern Europe, as ministers in Germany and elsewhere become increasingly nervous about the damage a Greek exit could do. If Greece manages to renegotiate its bailout and cling to its euro membership, however, it will perpetuate an unstable and highly uncertain situation. There is no cathartic end to the euro crisis in sight.</p>
      <p>SAM FLEMING</p>
      <p>3 A Greek exit could accelerate a referendum</p>
      <p>The eurozone crisis is turning wheels inexorably towards Britain's first referendum on Europe since 1975.</p>
      <p>George Osborne, the Chancellor, has conceded as much and Nick Herbert, the Home Office minister, today tells The Times (interview, pages 34, 35) that the UK is approaching the point where a vote on the country's place in Europe is inevitable.</p>
      <p>The stepping stones are easy to sketch. A revamped eurozone that includes pooled fiscal sovereignty and bank regulation, with or without Greece, will reshape the Continent.</p>
      <p>Britain's relationship with the new bloc within the European Union will change. Public consent for a new settlement will be desirable, runs the argument. There is a red herring in such scenarios in the shape of the Government's referendum lock, the act that requires the public to approve any proposal that shifts powers from London to Brussels. David Cameron is hardly likely to make such proposals.</p>
      <p>Yet even if it can be argued that there is no direct transfer of powers to the Continent, Britain's relationship with a new EU bloc will alter.</p>
      <p>And it will be proper for the public to approve it, as took place in 1975. Lord Mandelson, the pro-European former Labour Cabinet minister, makes this point. In other words, the referendum will be a political decision rather than a legal requirement.</p>
      <p>But what will the question be? Calls for an in/out vote are increasingly strident, but Mr Cameron will not want a campaign that splits him and most of the Cabinet from much of the Conservative grass roots.</p>
      <p>More likely is a vote to approve a new relationship with any safeguards and opt-outs that Mr Cameron has managed to negotiate. But if he fails to convince the europhobe tendency of his own party, such a vote could easily become a proxy for quitting the EU.</p>
      <p>ROLAND WATSON</p>
      <p>4 A eurozone break-up will affect the 2015 general election</p>
      <p>Britain's financial reckoning from a eurozone break-up also comes with a political price tag that will complicate the 2015 election campaign for the coalition. George Osborne has already been forced into a major rewrite of his spending plans, delaying by two years, to 2017, the point at which the structural deficit is wiped out. The UK is facing an extra two years of austerity as a result.</p>
      <p>From next year, the Tories and Liberal Democrats will have to start drawing up spending plans for the first three years of the next Parliament, in which they will have to find billions of pounds of extra cuts. Mr Osborne has suggested the welfare budget alone needs to lose £10 billion.</p>
      <p>Yet a Greek exit would play further havoc with Britain's growth, and therefore with Mr Osborne's room for manoeuvre. Failing to agree a spending round would effectively bring about the end of the coalition.</p>
      <p>Even if the governing parties can agree the overall size of the cuts, the larger the figure, the more scope there is for party political point-scoring about where the axe should fall, with all the associated tensions that would bring to government.</p>
      <p>And with promised austerity stretching into the middle distance and anti-austerity parties winning power in Europe, Nick Clegg may well see a virtue in not merely distancing the Liberal Democrats from the image of never-ending Tory cuts. His activists will pressure him to step decisively towards Labour.</p>
      <p>ROLAND WATSON</p>
      <p>5 A two-speed Europe is unlikely to serve British interests</p>
      <p>As well as applying a big, potentially huge, jolt to the whole European economy, a Greek departure from the euro will accelerate the German-led push to a much more federal European Union. Chaos spreading from Greece will greatly concentrate minds in Paris, Rome and the other eurozone capitals that have been failing to convince Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, to sign off more funds with few strings attached.</p>
      <p>The alternative to a federal leap would be to let the euro unravel, with dire consequences for the world economy. In the rush for safety, President Hollande of France would have to start preparing a sceptical public to accept the idea of giving up more sovereignty to "Brussels" - the price that Germany is imposing for pooling of debt and backstopping the stricken south.</p>
      <p>This would inevitably set the scene for the two-speed Europe that Britain and the other more detached members of the EU had long resisted. A much more integrated eurozone would form the core of a wider EU. It would include new authorities to regulate national budget and banking and move towards more harmonised taxes and social security systems. This would cause an impact on the single market, the open framework for goods and, to a lesser extent, services that Britain jealously guards as the most beneficial aspect. The presence of a powerful integrated bloc of 16 at the heart of the 28-member union, as it becomes in January, would inevitably push non-euro states farther towards the periphery.</p>

      <p>There is an inverse correlation between the brilliance of Joy Williams's writing and the ease of getting hold of it in Britain. Williams, 77, is one of the greats of American literature, fêted by big names from Raymond Carver to Don DeLillo.</p>
      <p>Her previous novel, The Quick and the Dead, a Pulitzer finalist, is out of print here. Her short stories, more than 30 years of work collected in The Visiting Privilege, were published in Britain only in 2016.</p>
      <p>A fanfare, then, for Harrow, Williams's first novel since 2000 and the culmination of decades of eco-angst kindled in the 1980s by writing about tourism's destructive impact on the Florida Keys, where she used to live. If Williams's world was at the edge of an ecological disaster in The Quick and the Dead, it plunges off that precipice in Harrow, a caustic tale about the collapse of civilisation.</p>
      <p>"It's too late to be afraid," says Khristen, a young woman who is ostensibly the main character. Williams, right, whose father was a Congregationalist minister, sets the tone with a prologue set in Purgatory: a group chat among themselves while awaiting what comes next in a scene that conjures the harrowing of Hell, the period between Christ's crucifixion and resurrection. "I think the world is dying because we were dead to its astonishments pretty much. It'll be around but it will become less and less until it's finally compatible with our feelings for it," a nameless voice says.</p>
      <p>The message may be bleak but the tone is anything but; Williams is a bitingly funny writer. The plot, such as it is, revolves around Khristen. Her mother believes she is destined for something extraordinary after briefly dying as an infant before coming back to life. Khristen is sent to a bizarre boarding school in an old sanatorium. There are no books and no paper and the students have no idea what they are being groomed for. "Perhaps the ruthless and painful requirements of nothing." In any case, school life is curtailed when the campus is closed and the pupils expelled into a land "bright with raging fires ringed by sportsmen shooting the crazed creatures trying to escape the flames".</p>
      <p>Khristen winds up looking for her mother at an old motel on the edge of a lake known as Big Girl. There she finds a crazed band of geriatric eco-revolutionaries. "They were a gabby seditious lot, in the worst of health but with kamikaze hearts, an army of the aged and ill, determined to refresh, through crackpot violence, a plundered earth." She meets Jeffrey, a preternaturally bright ten-year-old, who is studying law while road tripping with his drunken mother. Later - how much later isn't clear; time is as meaningless in Harrow as the future - Khristen runs into Jeffrey again: he is a judge, still ten, in what appears to be the underworld.</p>
      <p>If the narrative is fractured, well, so is our world. And that is Williams's point, one she amplifies with references to harrows - spiky tools that break up the earth - which are everywhere in her broken land. "What good stories deal with is the horror and incomprehensibility of time, the dark encroachment of old catastrophes," Williams has said; she could have been talking about Harrow, a book that is as baffling and frustrating as it is brilliant and inspiring. Anyone new to her has a treat in store, provided they can get hold of her backlist.</p>

      <p>The Pillars of the Earth (Channel 4) The Event (Channel 4) The Genius of British Art: Flesh (Channel 4) The problem with the olden days - until Michael Faraday published his Law of Electromagnetic Induction in 1831 - is that they're unintentionally hilarious. Life was so unimaginably vile that every attempt to recreate them is just apt to make a viewer start laughing, nervously, out of sheer horror. Man, look at it. It's awful. Mud. Hens. Huge facial sores. Women getting raped. Children falling down wells. Hot mercury poured into open wounds. Horses having their heads cut off on battlefields.</p>
      <p>Rain for 500 years, non-stop, leading to whole counties getting wiped out by mildew. And everyone stinking of lard, pigs, urine and weasel.</p>
      <p>Any attempt to dramatise this dolorous period always ends up the same: hundreds of peasant extras standing around daubed in MAC "mud", rhubarbing, "You got the plague yet?" "No, that's not for another 500 years, dear", while a famous American actor - helicoptered in from Claridge's that morning - gets on with shaaaating out the script in his paculiar accernt in the foreground. Not that the script is usually much cop; if you're doing it properly, until Shakespeare comes along in the 1590s, the English language consists only of seven words anyway: lard, pig, rape, rain, agony, boredom and stab.</p>
      <p>Pity, then, The Pillars of the Earth, set right back in the Old Days - like, way back: the 12th century - in a period often called "the Anarchy", which sounds particularly unpleasant, even within the Olden Days Spectrum of Rankness.</p>
      <p>Adapted from the bestselling novel by Ken Follett, The Pillars of the Earth has been pumped up into a £25 million, eightpart mini series, co-executive produced by Tony and Ridley Scott. A huge hit in America in the summer - watched by many, one imagines, who presumed that this was simply documentary footage of contemporary England, maybe Manchester - The Pillars of the Earth centres on two stories: a dynastic battle for the throne of England and a humble stonemason's dream of building a new cathedral near Winchester.</p>
      <p>Of course, we've all seen an Olden Days "dynastic battle for the throne of England". We know what to expect and, in this respect, The Pillars of the Earth does not let us down. Yeah, there's a doddery old king (Henry I, played by Clive Wood), surrounded by shifty-looking courtiers - all of whom have clearly been making multiple entries into their "Dastardly Heir-Wrangling Scheme" jotters over the past ten years. And here's a spectacularly crass Scene of Historical Knowingness: Henry I inspecting what there is for tea and exclaiming "Lamprey! My favourite!" Presumably the next line, "How much do I want? Loads!", was left on the cutting room floor. Henry then dies - that's surfeit for you - and everyone piles in to carve up the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Noble chicks are raped; a scheming cougar-mother seduces her own son; a lot of peasants get their throats slit. The usual.</p>
      <p>However, The Pillars of the Earth's USP is its second narrative arc: a serf's dream of building a cathedral. We've never had that before. The serf in question is the incongruously LA-tanned Rufus Sewell, who plays a brilliant-but-downtrodden builder called "Tom Builder". This raised wild hopes - in this viewer, at least - that the rest of his social circle would consist of "Craig Peasant", "Alan Leper" and "Janet Get-Murdered", but, alas, it was not to be.</p>
      <p>As Builder goes about trying to convince someone to let him build a cathedral, The Pillars of the Earth started to naggingly remind me of another programme. It took me a few minutes to work it out but, as Sewell explained, his plans to have unprecedentedly large windows, thanks to his revolutionary adoption of the Moorish "arch", with the words, "A cathedral is God's anteroom. And the light - the light is everything", I suddenly got it. The Pillars of the Earth is the longest episode of Grand Designs so far!</p>
      <p>After that, the whole plot made sense. He has the usual problems: suppliers let him down (a fiefdom is carved up, denying him access to the quarry) and planning permission wrangles (the new King is a bit lemon about the whole endeavour.) And, as always, just before the third ad break, things look as though they're really going wrong: in most Grand Designs this is usually some dilemma over an off-white render. In Builder's case they arrest his girlfriend as a witch and threaten to burn her to death. But - as per the mores of Designs - a solution is eventually found, at the last minute: Builder's girlfriend escapes from the dungeons, leaps on to a table and dramatically urinates on Bishop Waleran Bigod, played by Ian McShane in a Betty Boo wig. Amazing.</p>
      <p>As episodes of Grand Designs go, The Pillars of the Earth is a bit of a doozy. I can't wait for next week, when the Scandinavian triple-glazed sliding doors to the kitchendiner get delayed on a ferry and Thomas à Becket gets hacked to death in Canterbury Cathedral. However, as a drama The Pillars of the Earth is one of the more risible offerings of the past five years. Those bad old days really were bad. It is a firkin of hoke. A puncheon. A kilderkin.</p>
      <p>A rundlet. A hogshead.</p>
      <p>More epic knackers from The Event, a series described as "a cross between Heroes, Lost and FlashForward". Of course, a brief glance at the zeitgeist clock tells us that it is firmly quarter past long-running sci-fi/conspiracy theory series o'clock - and yet here comes another one, four months after everyone stopped caring. In this respect The Event is very much Toploader to the Blur and Oasis of Lost and Heroes. It is putting out Dancing in the Moonlight just as everyone is taking Be Here Now down to the charity shop.</p>
      <p>The set up of The Event is simple and straightforward. Haha! Fooled you! Of course it's not! The set-up is, of course, as complicated and tangled as worm shit! That's how these things work, baby!</p>
      <p>So there's a hot guy (Sean Walker, played by Jason Ritter) who's on a cruise holiday with his girlfriend. Then she disappears into thin air. Next thing we know, he's hijacked a jet. Except that he hasn't. He's actually trying to stop the pilot hijacking the jet. And the pilot is his girlfriend's dad, who's trying to crash the plane into the President. The President is called Elias Martinez, and he's African-American. Whether or not we are supposed to notice this and regard it as one of the "mysteries" that need to be "solved" is, in itself, a mystery.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 50 years previously, the CIA captured some crashed aliens in Alaska. I can say "meanwhile" about something that happened 50 years previously, because The Event is big on flashbacks. In many ways, 50 years previously is right now, because there are flashbacks everywhere. Within one 12-minute sequence we get the captions "23 Minutes Before", "11 Days Before", "23 Months Before", "Eight Days Earlier" and "Alaska: 1945".</p>
      <p>The problem with The Event is that the makers are aware of the much-vaunted problems with Lost, Heroes, et al, ie, that they become infamously disjointed, illogical mish-mashes, bolted together by someone who is apparently smoking gigantic quantities of skunkweed and deciding major plot twists by way of rolling a 26-sided die and just shouting random words, such as "polar bear!" and "mysterious smoke!" To this end, The Event's executive producer, Evan Katz, tried to pre-empt audience wariness with the promise: "Everything is designed to answer questions, so you're not frustrated or feeling like we make it up as we go along."</p>
      <p>And here's the problem. Although no devotee of long-running sci-fi conspiracy theory thrillers, I can't help but feel that Katz may have spectacularly missed the point here. I've been on the fan boards for Lost and Heroes and, you know what the fans liked best of all about these shows? Bitching about how the writers are smoking loads of skunkweed and making it up as they go along. Without this kvetch glue to bind the audience together, I fear that The Event may be a bit ... well, non.</p>
      <p>Finally, The Genius of British Art: Flesh with this year's Man Booker Prize winner, Howard Jacobson, tackling the subject of the nude in British art. For the first half of the programme Jacobson took us around the Victorian art galleries and museums of his youth, indulging in some misty-eyed reminiscing on the "important role" they had played in his "artistic" "development", hem-hem. "Here we see a celebration of fleshy plenty and fleshy torment," he enthused, over shots of nymphs seducing lush-lipped boys, and goddesses cavorting in Elysian meadows.</p>
      <p>Anyone experiencing difficulties with the pink tones on their television would have had a troublesome 40 minutes - this was a hurricane of tits, arse and muff. The sheer volume of nuddiness was borderline overwhelming. At one point I went a bit Vietnam and started to think that a pair of nipples by William Etty were following me around the room, like pink mouse-eyes.</p>
      <p>Jacobson's beef - raised halfway in - was that we just don't do stuff like this any more. In an argument that ultimately never really hung together, he complained that modern art is too scared of being accused of misogyny and too obsessed with being moral to do luscious nudes any longer. "Less is more is the catchphrase of our times," he mourned, next to a Sarah Lucas "nude" consisting of two oranges and a bucket.</p>
      <p>I, in turn, mourned a breed of TV essayist who couldn't just come out and say what he wanted to say, to wit: "The birds in porn are orange and have arses like a little boy's! It just doesn't do it for me! I want a Victorian strumpet with squeezy dib-dabs and a wibbly-wobbly arse like a big white blancmange!"</p>
      <p>Rufus Sewell plays a builder called Tom Builder. I hoped he might know a Craig Peasant or Alan Leper</p>

      <p>London's best homes seem oblivious to the global credit crunch, says Judith Heywood</p>
      <p>THE year is finishing as it began. This week a rather ugly four-bedroom house in Mayfair -pictured on the cover -with a very lovely garden went on the market for £ 15 million. The details of the sale by Wetherell, the Mayfair agent, highlight how the smartest postcodes have remained largely unaffected by the slowdown. The price includes planning approval to demolish the home and replace it -at a cost of more millions of pounds -with a 10,500 sq ft house, including a swimming pool, media room and staff quarters.</p>
      <p>This time last year, most observers were tipping a slowdown in London property prices. But the unleashing of £ 5.5 billion of City bonuses fuelled an unprecedented frenzy -and the party carried on throughout 2007 as buyers bid fast and high to invest the cash in prestige homes.</p>
      <p>THE WINNERS</p>
      <p>The most furious activity was in the prime central postcodes. City warriors were determined to secure a stake in Kensington, Chelsea, Belgravia, Mayfair, Holland Park or Notting Hill but had to compete with wealthy overseas buyers. Asking prices in June were as much as 57 per cent higher year on year in Mayfair, according to Primelocation.com, and overseas buyers seemed to have come out on top. This year they accounted for 60 per cent of purchases of the £ 4 million-plus homes that make up "super-prime" property, according to Knight Frank.</p>
      <p>This led to what Brian D'Arcy Clark, of Savills, describes as "the toothpaste effect", of other buyers being squeezed out to outlying areas. Prices jumped in the family suburbs of Fulham, Wimbledon and Barnes in southwest London, and once-gritty areas such as Southwark, Camden and Islington were among the highest risers. This was the year in which such locations lost their second-choice designation.</p>
      <p>THE LOSERS</p>
      <p>Extraordinary headline figures for Greater London -for example, prices were growing at a rate of 15.7 per cent a year by the end of June, according to Nationwide -skewed house price data and masked the fact that some areas were languishing. High-spending buyers were pushed out but not as far as Harrow, where annual growth was at a relatively shabby 9.4 per cent, the Land Registry reported in November.</p>
      <p>East London felt this particular chill worst. Speculative investors have in recent years flooded in on the promise of Olympics and regeneration projects. But this year experts questioned how much higher prices could go. The worst performers of the year were the boroughs of Bexley (up 8.4 per cent), Newham (9.5) and Barking (9.8). John Saville, of Spicerhaart, says: "We have seen some settlement of values in Stratford because the infrastructure is not yet in place."</p>
      <p>Price rises pushing 10 per cent in a year would be the envy of most property owners, but the troubles besetting most other regions did catch up with London. In August, Rightmove reported the first drop in asking prices in a year, by October the Land Registry was saying house prices were falling faster in London than in any other region.</p>
      <p>FORECAST FOR 2008</p>
      <p>Brian D'Arcy Clark, of Savills, says that prices will hold firm for prime property such as the potential building site in Mayfair, where "the opportunity presents itself for the very rich to buy or create the home they want. Spectacular houses remain in short supply." More modest family homes will also hold their value but only if they are high quality or in good locations. Liam Bailey, of Knight Frank, says: "Vendors of the very best properties will be able to name their own price (almost), but for the rest of the market growth will be noticeably lower." Lucian Cook, of Savills, advises: "We expect the best-located property to continue to perform best, with properties which are blighted or in a secondary location to find it much harder."</p>
      <p>So the outlook is gloomier for 2008, but Londoners seem best placed to weather any storms, with observers expecting the current slowdown to be a mere glitch. Knight Frank expects annual growth of 3 per cent across Greater London and Savills says that the market should recover to record growth of 5 per cent by the end of next year, after a turbulent first quarter. Hamptons thinks that prime Central and North London will grow 4 per cent and South London by 3 per cent.</p>
      <p>And best of all? Savills expects the capital to outperform most regions for at least the next few years, a prediction that should help to encourage a return to the market by buyers scared off by the hangover they have felt in the latter part of an extraordinary year.</p>
      <p>HEALTH CHECK</p>
      <p>If there was any property worth owning in 2007, it was a smart home in London.</p>
      <p>There seemed to be no limit to what buyers would pay -particularly for those in such prestige Central London locations as Belgravia, Mayfair and Chelsea. Take this 4,702 sq ft Georgian property on Earls Terrace, near Kensington High Street.</p>
      <p>Its charming facade (which hides a four-bedroom home adorned with modern luxuries), private access to Edwardes Square and staff accommodation attracted much interest. Bidding was fierce and it sold swiftly through Knight Frank for about £ 1 million more than the £ 6.95 million asking price.</p>
